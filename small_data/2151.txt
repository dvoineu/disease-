States, local communities, and tribes play an important role in preventing
opioid overdoses and related harms. They run prescription drug monitoring
programs, regulate controlled substances, license healthcare providers,
respond to drug overdose outbreaks, and run large public insurance programs
such as Medicaid and Workers Compensation. CDC is nationally recognized for
its work with health departments and community-based organizations, and the
agency has a long track record of funding efforts to improve data collection
and implement evidence-based prevention strategies.

Overdose Data to Action (OD2A)

OD2A is a cooperative agreement that aims to increase the timeliness and
comprehensiveness of data and to use those data to inform public health
response and prevention activities.
