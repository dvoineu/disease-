The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) datasets are available for public
use, so that researchers and public health managers can explore the data in
detail. In addition, states can compare their estimates of prevalence of youth
tobacco use with national data.

The NYTS was designed to provide national data on long-term, intermediate, and
short-term indicators key to the design, implementation, and evaluation of
comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs. The NYTS also serves as
a baseline for comparing progress toward meeting selected _Healthy People
2020_ goals for reducing tobacco use among youth:

Items measured as part of the NYTS survey include correlates of tobacco use
such as demographics, minors' access to tobacco, and exposure to secondhand
