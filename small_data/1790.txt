The TBTC is a collaboration of researchers from the CDC, domestic and
international public health departments, academic medical centers, and
selected Veterans Administration medical centers whose mission is to conduct
programmatically relevant research concerning the diagnosis, clinical
management, and prevention of tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease. The
purposes of the TBTC are to conduct research that expands clinical and
epidemiologic knowledge of TB and facilitates the diagnosis, clinical
management, and prevention of tuberculosis infection and disease; to integrate
research into the care of persons with TB infection and disease; to develop
research questions that are relevant to program settings in general; to
promote research within local TB control programs through collaboration on
clinical research of relevance to public health settings; and to provide a
forum for international collaborative research of importance to both domestic
and international TB control.

Since its inception, the Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC) has undertaken
nine major trials and 15 sub-studies. The completed TBTC studies have resulted
in 25 publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as over 100
presentations, posters, and abstracts at major medical or scientific meetings.
The results of TBTC Study 22 significantly influenced the most recent American
Thoracic Society (ATS)/CDC guidelines for treatment of TB (published in 2003);
other TBTC study results have led to modification of CDC's recommendations for
treatment of TB and HIV.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * TBTC Partners

In 2009 the TBTC underwent its third formal external re-competition. In the
next decade (2010-2020), TBTC patient enrollment will shift from clinical
sites located mostly in North America to sites which are predominantly
international. The 2009 re-competition has expanded TBTC's international
presence from a few clinical study sites located outside of North America, to
sites in Peru, Spain, South Africa (two sites), Uganda, Kenya, Vietnam, and
China (Hong Kong). The TBTC 2010-2020 research group also includes U.S. sites
in New York, Washington DC, Texas (four sites), Colorado and Tennessee.  Some
TBTC sites in and outside North America are linked, in that CDC awarded funds
for the international study sites to the U.S.-based institutions that proposed
them as partners in the competitive process.

TBTC clinical trials have enrolled more than 14,000 patients and volunteers
over the past 20 years. The consortium's annual operating budget is
approximately $9,000,000.00. Confronting the many challenges to the successful
development of new TB drugs and treatment regimens, the TBTC looks forward
with optimism. The late pipeline of new anti-TB drug candidates is the most
promising in 40 years, and advances in TB clinical trials science have
fostered the progress of these agents. With commitment and support from CDC,
the TBTC provides a unique resource for these clinical studies, and will
continue to play an important role in improving TB treatment, prevention and
control. Currently the TBTC is conducting an international, multicenter,
randomized, controlled, open-label, 3-arm, phase 3 non-inferiority trial. The
results of this clinical trial determine the efficacy, using the definitive
endpoint of durable cure, of a regimen containing rifapentine substituted for
rifampin and administered in combination with other drugs for 17 weeks
(approximately four months).

The infrastructure of the TB Trials Consortium includes:  
• A network of clinical sites worldwide whose principal investigators are
recognized experts in tuberculosis treatment and prevention  
• Experienced clinical coordinators and outreach workers at each of the funded
sites  
• Extensive communications systems, including biannual conferences  
• Close and collaborative relationships with local TB control programs to
facilitate the recruitment and management of trial patients  
• An expert Data & Safety Monitoring Board, which reviews active protocols  
• Coordination with the CDC IRB and local IRBs, and support for a CDC-based
Central IRB process  
• A Data and Coordinating Center at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta  
• Cooperative relationships with key manufacturers of TB drugs  
• Support for monitoring, training, and protocol development from a leading
international contract research organization  
• Laboratory support from the national reference laboratory housed in the
Mycobacteriology Laboratory Branch at CDC

Developing new TB treatment and prevention strategies depends upon
collaboration among academic, private sector and government researchers and
non-governmental organizations. CDC works closely with such organizations as
the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Global
Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance), the Foundation for Innovative
New Diagnostics (FIND), the Johns Hopkins Center for Tuberculosis Research,
the TB Research Unit at Case Western Reserve University, commercial drug
manufacturers, and others within and outside the United States.
