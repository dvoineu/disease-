**What is the U.S. Yellow Fever Vaccination Center Registry?**  
It is a web-based directory of authorized yellow fever vaccination centers in
the U.S. that is maintained by CDC and state health departments.

Back to Top

**Why do we need this registry?**  
According to International Health Regulations, yellow fever vaccine must be
administered at certified yellow fever vaccination centers. Health-care
providers are authorized to administer the vaccine by state health departments
and the states then report certified providers to CDC. The registry serves as
a central reporting location that simplifies tracking and improves
communication between CDC, health departments, and vaccine providers.

Back to Top

**How is this going to help people who need the vaccine?**  
Persons who need the vaccine can easily locate a certified center located near
them by using the registry's directory. Also, in case there is a need for CDC
to distribute urgent information about yellow fever or the vaccine, CDC could
contact centers quickly.

Back to Top

**Who has access to the registry?**  
The public has access to the directory of vaccination centers. CDC and state
health departments have administrative access to a secure site that allows
provider and facility information to be added and updated.

**I am a certified provider of yellow fever vaccine, but do not see my
facility listed. How can I get my facility included in the registry?**  
CDC must be notified by your state health department that your facility has
been authorized to administer yellow fever vaccine.  Contact your state health
department to make sure your facility has been registered with CDC. You can
contact CDC at dqyellowfever@cdc.gov to find out who you should speak to at
your state health department.

Back to Top

**I am a health-care provider who is not currently certified to give yellow
fever vaccine. How do I become certified to administer yellow fever vaccine?**  
According to the WHO International Health Regulations, you must be certified
to administer yellow fever vaccine by your state health department.  CDC does
NOT authorize providers. You can contact CDC at dqyellowfever@cdc.gov to find
out who you should speak to at your state health department for more
information on becoming certified.

Prophylaxis?**
