Melioidosis is a disease caused by germs that occur naturally in certain parts
of the world, such as Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The only place
these germs, called _Burkholderia pseudomallei,_ occur naturally in the United
States is Puerto Rico. Usually, people in the United States (outside of Puerto
Rico) who get the disease have traveled and come into contact with the germs
in one of these places where they occur naturally. One reason public health
authorities study the disease is because it is possible that the germs that
cause melioidosis might be used in a biological attack. A biological attack is
the intentional release of germs that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or
crops.
