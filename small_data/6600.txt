Weight-for-stature



The clinical charts for infants and older children were published in two sets.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Set 1 contains 10 charts (5 for boys and 5 for girls), with the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th smoothed percentile lines for all charts, and the 85th percentile for BMI-for-age and weight-for-stature.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Set 2 contains 10 charts (5 for boys and 5 for girls), with the 3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th smoothed percentile lines for all charts, and the 85th percentile for BMI-for-age and weight-for-stature.



Set 1 has the outer limits of the curves at the 5th and 95th percentiles.
These are the charts that most users in the United States will find useful for
the majority of routine clinical assessments. Set 2 has the outer limits of
the curves at the 3rd and 97th percentiles for selected applications.
Pediatric endocrinologists and others who assess the growth of children with
special health care requirements may wish to use the format in set 2 for
selected applications.

Two summary files, each with all 10 clinical charts in set 1 or set 2 are also
available. These summary files contain the clinical charts from either set 1
or set 2 as described above.

Infants (birth to 24 months) must be measured for length, and the sex
appropriate length-for-age or weight-for-length charts for infants, birth to
36 months must be used to plot the measurements. At age 24 months and older,
if children can stand unassisted and follow directions, stature should be
measured and plotted on the stature-for-age chart for children (2 to 20
years). Otherwise, between 24 and 36 months, length can be used in place of
stature.

BMI-for-age charts are recommended to assess weight in relation to stature for
children ages 2 to 20 years. The weight-for-stature charts are available as an
alternative to accommodate children ages 2-5 years who are not evaluated
beyond the preschool years. However, all health care providers should consider
using the BMI-for-age charts to be consistent with current recommendations.

All individual 2000 CDC growth charts have an initial publication date of May
30, 2000. For various reasons, modifications were made to charts after the
initial publication date. For example, the individual charts were modified to
create the clinical charts, which were made available on October 16, 2000.
Subsequent modifications were made to selected clinical charts to correct or
enhance particular aspects of the scales on the graphs. In all cases, the data
points in the corresponding data file for each modified chart remain unchanged
from the initial release on May 30, 2000. Where applicable, when selected
clinical charts were further modified, the date is indicated on each chart.
The clinical growth charts for stature-for-age were modified because the scale
for inches was not correctly aligned with the metric scale. The clinical
growth charts for infant length-for-age and infant weight-for-age were revised
to improve the appearance of the scale for inches on the length charts by
extending the indicators at ½ inch increments, and enhancing alignment of the
English with the metric scales on both the length and weight scales.

Users should use the most recent version of each chart, as available on the
growth charts web site.



### To view, print, and reproduce clinical growth charts

All clinical growth charts may be viewed, downloaded, and printed in Adobe
Acrobat. For routine viewing on a computer monitor and printing on a laser
printer, the individual charts are available as PDF files (Black and White).
All clinical charts have been colorized for viewing and printing. When routed
to a color printer, the clinical charts for boys will print in blue and the
clinical charts for girls will print in red. Otherwise, these same charts can
be routed to a black-and-white printer, and will print in black-and-white.
Higher resolution PDF files (Color) are available to provide the highest
resolution and are intended to be used as a high quality print master for
quantity production when using the services of a commercial printing facility.
The recommended ink colors for printing are Pantone 206 red (for girls) and
Pantone 286 blue (for boys). The recommended paper weight is 80#. Charts
should be printed as two-sided copies, in the following combinations for each
sex:

Infants, birth to 36 months:
