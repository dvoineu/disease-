**Preface**

The Tool for Assessing Asthma Referral Systems (TAARS) is intended for use by
asthma control programs as a guide in helping to understand the how
effectively their referral systems are operating within their programs.
Programs can use TAARS to conduct a comprehensive or more focused assessment
of their referral system. Assessment may include determining how a referral
system is structured, how networks are formed, whether appropriate written
referral protocols and guidelines exist, the processes providers follow to
refer clients, how well referrals are tracked and followed up, and barriers to
referral initiation and referral completion. Using TAARS can also help you
better understand how the different types of referrals among the different
service providers operate in communities.

TAARS: Tool for Assessing Asthma Referral Systems

TAARS was adapted from the Referral Systems Assessment and Monitoring Toolkit,
originally developed by MEASURE Evaluation for the _President 's Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)_ for HIV/AIDS service providers. This tool can
be used as is or it can be adapted to the specific design and purpose of your
particular asthma referral system. It may be most useful in the context of
overall evaluation planning and implementation, as recommended in the Learning
and Growing through Evaluation series
(https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/program_eval/guide.htm). Specifically, TAARS can
help guide the focus and methodological considerations of a broader
evaluation, such as is laid out in Steps 3 and 4 (Focus the Evaluation Design
and Gather Credible Evidence) of the CDC's Framework for Program Evaluation
(https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/program_eval/guide.htm).1

**Background**

Integrating health services across clinical and community-based settings
improves the efficiency of the health system and provides greater access to
services for clients, ultimately improving the well-being of clients.
Providing comprehensive asthma control services entails integration and
linkages between clinical services and services that exist outside of the
health system, such as social services, educational services, and community-
based services. For this reason, referral systems, which may also be called
linkage systems, should be efficient, effectively connect people to needed
services, and provide sufficient data to assure optimal care management.

Community services sites often use their own unique, sometimes entirely
unstructured, referral networks. These networks may rely solely on informal,
personal recommendations. In these settings, there is not just one referral
system but several unstructured, very fluid systems operating simultaneously.
A tool like TAARS can help you better understand the nuances of those systems
and help identify where the gaps are and where improvements can be made. TAARS
can also be useful in developing contracts or agreements with partners,
describing the processes each uses for making or receiving referrals to or
from programs, and to potentially encourage some level of standardization or
consistency across programs. Further, and importantly, documentation of the
context for the referral system will promote understanding and communication
across programs and serve as institutional memory, especially valuable when
staff turnover occurs.

**How to use TAARS**

To use TAARS, follow the steps below, collecting the relevant information at
the level of detail that fits your context and your needs. Tailor it to your
program's specifics.

As with all evaluation processes, begin by engaging the stakeholders who have
an interest in the referral system. These may include service providers, case
managers, clients, and those involved in recording and tracking referrals. In
addition to improving your evaluation, stakeholder participation in the
assessment will raise awareness about the importance of referrals, motivate
reflection, and generate interest in strengthening the referral system.

**3\. Include a visual depiction**

In addition to a narrative description, a flow chart or other graphic of how
the referral system is structured may be helpful by detailing the universe of
services and direction or bi-directionality of the referrals. Once you have a
visual depiction or graphic, engage stakeholders to ensure there is shared
understanding of the referral system and how it is intended to work.

**4\. Identify evaluation questions**

Once you have a shared understanding of the referral system, engage in
discussion to identify the evaluation questions that will effectively address
the evaluation purpose. For example, you may want to know whether the
protocols for the referral system are adequate and contain sufficient
information, or if the referral system captures referrals in a timely manner
such that it facilitates appropriate interventions. Be aware that reviewing
the referral system protocols might elicit additional important evaluation
questions you will want to answer.

![question mark icons](/asthma/program_eval/images/question_marks-
thumbnail.jpg)

Consider what your stakeholders need to know and how the information will be
used. Tailor the design of your data collection efforts accordingly, bearing
in mind the issue of "credibility" (i.e., evidence your stakeholders will
value as valid and reliable.) Align efforts to your specific needs.

**5\. Gather and review referral system protocols and other supporting
documentation**

![a man weighed down under a heavy
file](/asthma/program_eval/images/a_man_weighed_diwn_by_a_file-thumbnail.jpg)

Determine if protocols or other guidance documents exist for referral system
operations and expectations. Carefully review the protocols and all supporting
documentation for pertinent information, noting any critical missing pieces.

**7\. Analyze the data**

![Drawing of people meeting to discuss
data](/asthma/program_eval/images/icons_analying_data-thumbnail.jpg)

Once data are collected, use a participatory process with data collectors and
stakeholders to analyze and reflect on the data collected. Actively engage
stakeholders in reviewing the findings, interpreting them, and contributing to
discussion about possible explanations for the findings. Discuss the measures
by which you will judge whether the referral system is "successful" and how
you will justify your conclusions.  
Consider the referral system elements in Table 4 below and tailor the list to
your program's characteristics and needs.

Conclude with recommendations and action planning to ensure findings are used.
After analyzing the referral system elements and interview responses, discuss
with those engaged in the assessment and make recommendations for areas of
improvement. Clearly document and share these recommendations with key
referral system stakeholders (both at the local and state levels, as
appropriate) and with key decision-makers who can effect changes in the
referral system's functioning. Prioritize recommendations and define concrete
actions to improve the referral system. Develop an Action Plan to document
plans for using the findings from the assessment. Refer to Appendix K of
Implementing Evaluations (Module 2 of Learning and Growing through Evaluation)
for a template specifically for documenting and tracking use of evaluation
findings: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/program_eval/asthmaprogramguide_mod2.pdf
