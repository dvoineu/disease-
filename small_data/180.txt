Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused
by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first
reported in Asia in February 2003. The illness spread to more than two dozen
countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS
global outbreak of 2003 was contained.

Since 2004, there have not been any known cases of SARS reported anywhere in
the world. The content in this website was developed for the 2003 SARS
epidemic. But some guidelines are still being used. Any new SARS updates will
be posted on this website.

SARS Virus is Now a Select Agent

On October 5, 2012, the National Select Agent Registry Program published a
final rule declaring SARS coronavirus a select agent.

A select agent is a bacterium, virus or toxin that has the potential to pose a
severe threat to public health and safety.
