# Emergency Kit Checklist for Families with Children and Youth with Special
Healthcare Needs (CYSHCN)

Minus

Related Pages

If a child with special healthcare needs is part of your family it is very
important to be prepared for an emergency in which you may have to stay inside
for longer than usual or in the event the electricity goes out. An emergency
kit is necessary for all families, and especially important for families of
children with special healthcare needs.

kit-icon.jpg)

An emergency kit has all of the things that you and your family may need
during an emergency. In addition to the common items found on the emergency
kit checklist for kids and families page, the checklist described here
contains items that are specific for families of children and youth with
special healthcare needs (CYSHCN). Each family's kit will vary depending on
the individual needs of their child. It is best to have all of these things
collected before an emergency, stored in a container, and kept in a place that
is safe and easy to get to in the event of an emergency. Making a family
emergency kit can be fun for the family to do together. Here's how to have a
family emergency kit treasure hunt:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1. You will need a large plastic bin or box to put things into.
