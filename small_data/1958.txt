                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. CDC should develop a system with sufficient testing capacity to enable molecular DR testing for one AFB smear-positive or NAA-positive respiratory specimen or one _M. tuberculosis_ culture from each TB patient or TB suspect _and_ specimens or isolates from persons that the local or state TB Control Program designates as high priority for testing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. CDC should evaluate existing molecular DR testing services to identify best practices.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. CDC should use a phased approach to implementing a universal molecular DR testing service.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. CDC should immediately establish an interim service to provide molecular DR testing for persons at high-risk of having MDR TB and those deemed high priority by the local TB program. CDC is encouraged to explore using supplements to existing cooperative agreements to provide sufficient new funds to existing, proficient molecular DR testing laboratories to allow them to expand their capacities to meet this need. The interim service could serve as a pilot project to inform the development of a universal molecular DR testing service.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5. CDC should establish and fund regional laboratories to provide molecular DR testing for state and local TB programs. Funds in the current TB Elimination Cooperative Agreements should not be redirected to the molecular DR testing program. The molecular DR testing laboratories should 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. coordinate molecular DR testing services with the medical consultation and training services of the TB Regional Training and Medical Consultation Centers (RTMCCs),
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. provide six-day-a-week service,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. use validated molecular methods to detect rifampin and isoniazid resistance,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4. implement molecular DR testing for anti-TB drugs other than rifampin and isoniazid (e.g., fluoroquinolones) as the tests are developed and validated,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          5. report results electronically within two business days of specimen receipt,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          6. report detection of drug resistance in specimen or isolate by telephone to facilitate prompt action by the program and clinician,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          7. ensure notification of appropriate individuals (e.g., local program, laboratory, clinician) of the need for expedited testing of rifampin-resistant samples for susceptibility to first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          8. participate in an external quality assurance program.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6. CDC should work with TB partners and state and local TB programs and laboratories to identify and overcome potential obstacles and barriers to implementing a regional molecular DR testing service, such as local regulations regarding out-of-state testing, certification of laboratories, reporting requirements, and need for memoranda of agreement.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        7. CDC and partners should develop clear policies and standard operating procedures for referring specimens to the molecular DR testing laboratories. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. CDC should develop and fund a process for shipping _M. tuberculosis_ cultures to the molecular DR testing laboratories.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. CDC should develop and fund a process for shipping specimens to the molecular DR testing laboratories for TB laboratories or programs that can not afford the cost of shipping.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        8. CDC should coordinate, and possibly integrate, activities of the molecular DR testing and genotyping laboratories to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and shipment of isolates.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        9. CDC should work with partners to develop external quality assurance, proficiency testing, and rechecking programs for the molecular DR testing service.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        10. CDC should develop a robust process for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the molecular DR testing laboratories. This should include post-market surveillance to determine the performance, cost, and benefit of the molecular DR tests as performed in a regional testing service.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        11. CDC should work with partners to develop protocols to analyze discrepancies in the results of molecular DR and conventional tests. CDC should collect data on and investigate discrepancies to better understand the performance of molecular and conventional DS testing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        12.
