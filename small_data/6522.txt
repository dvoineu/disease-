# Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Meningitis

## Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Meningitis Caused by _Neisseria
meningitidis_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , and _Haemophilus influenzae_.

### Second edition (2011)

This manual summarizes laboratory techniques used in the isolation and
identification and characterization of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (the
meningococcus), _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (the pneumococcus) and _Haemophilus
influenzae_ from the cerebrospinal fluid or blood of patients with clinical
meningitis or bacteremia. The procedures described in this manual are not new;
most have been used for many years. Even though they require an array of
laboratory capabilities, these procedures were selected because of their
utility, ease of performance, and ability to give reproducible results. The
diversity of laboratory capabilities, the availability of materials and
supplies, and their cost, were taken into account. In addition to these basic
procedures, methods for subtyping and biotyping of these organisms are
included for reference laboratories that have the facilities, the trained
personnel, and the desire to perform them.
