Purpose

This document provides guidance to facilitate planning for and execution of
patient handoff between personnel at a fixed facility (hospital or clinic) and
the transporting ambulance agency. Information is presented in a chronological
format and is provided at a level of detail that will afford local planners
and operators the flexibility to develop procedures that are suitable for
their environment. References from peer-reviewed literature are included and
provide greater detail as articulated by the authors.

The following key assumptions are being made:
