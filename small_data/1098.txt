Toxocariasis is the parasitic disease caused by the larvae of two species of
_Toxocara_ roundworms: _Toxocara canis_ from dogs and, less commonly,
_Toxocara cati_ from cats. Toxocariasis is considered one of the Neglected
Parasitic Infections, a group of five parasitic diseases that have been
targeted by CDC for public health action.
