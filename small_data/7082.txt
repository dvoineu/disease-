### A comprehensive biochemical assessment of nutrition status

CDC's Second Nutrition Report is part of a series of publications that provide
ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's nutrition status by measuring
blood and urine concentrations of biochemical indicators (such as nutrients or
a dietary indicator with potential health relevance).

Covering 58 biochemical indicators, CDC's Second Report is the most
comprehensive biochemical assessment of the nutritional status of the U.S.
population - it shows us what the levels of nutrition indicators are actually
in people - general population and selected groups such as children, women of
childbearing age, and minorities.

The CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences in the National Center for
Environmental Health conducted the laboratory analyses for the second report
using data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2003 to 2006. The report does not include a state-by-state breakdown on
nutritional status…
