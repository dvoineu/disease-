Webber MP, Carpiniello KE, Oruwariye T, Lo Y, Burton WB, Appel DK. Burden of
asthma in inner-city elementary schoolchildren: Do school-based health centers
make a difference? Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine
2003;157:125-9.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Six elementary schools: four with a school-based health center (SBHC) and two
without a SBHC (comparison schools)

**Target Population:**  
Children in kindergarten through fifth grade attending inner-city schools in
the Bronx that were participating in the study

**Program Description:**  
About 1,400 SBHCs provide care to 1.1 million children in the United States.
Whether access to on-site health services is associated with better health
outcomes, is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the
availability of SBHCs measurably affected the health and school performance of
children with asthma. The study examined differences in emergency visits,
hospitalizations, medication use, and school absenteeism. Bilingual Spanish
and English surveys were sent home with children during the 1999-2000 school
year. The survey asked about demographics, whether the child has asthma, and
the presence of specific asthmatic symptoms in the last year. Of the 6,433
families surveyed, 74.2% returned completed questionnaires (72.6% from SBHC
schools and 78.7% from comparison schools). Eighty-seven percent of the
children at these schools whose parents or caretakers responded to the survey
had health insurance coverage. The prevalence of probable asthma was 18.9% at
SBHC schools and 22.4% at comparison schools. Criteria for probable asthma
included responding "yes" to the question inquiring whether the child had ever
had asthma and reporting that one or more of the following was true during the
past 12 months: 1) taken asthma medication; 2) experienced sleep disturbance
because of wheezing, coughing, or tightness in the chest; 3) coughed after or
during exercise when the child did not have a cold; 4) had weather-related
breathing problems; or 5) wheezed in the presence of pets, mold, strong odors
or cigarette smoke. During the study period, 13.5% of all visits to SBHCs were
for asthma care, with a mean annual frequency of 4.9 visits per child. About
half of the children with asthma used the SBHCs for asthma care during this
1-year period.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A cohort study design was used.

**Sample Size:**  
The study comprised 949 children with asthma (645 from the four schools with
SBHCs and 304 from the two comparison schools).

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included activity limitation, hospitalization, emergency
visits, and school absenteeism. A total of 234 (27.1%) of the 865 respondents
to this question from all schools reported at least a moderate amount of
activity limitation; 293 (33.9%) of the same respondents reported their child
did not experience any activity limitation. No statistically significant
differences were noted in activity limitation by sex, race or ethnicity,
health insurance coverage, or availability of an SBHC. Of the 949 children,
120 (12.6%) from all schools had been hospitalized for asthma at least once in
the previous year. Children attending the comparison schools were more likely
to have been hospitalized for asthma (17.l%) than those in schools with SBHCs
(10.5%). No statistically significant differences were noted between
hospitalization and sex, race or ethnicity, and health insurance coverage. A
total of 438 (46.2%) of the 949 parents from all schools responded that the
child had emergency treatment at least once for asthma in the past year. No
statistically significant differences were noted in emergency visits by sex,
race or ethnicity, health insurance coverage, or availability of an SBHC.
Overall, students in the comparison school missed about 2 more days of school
than those in schools with an SBHC (16.4 and 14.5 days, respectively). Among
children with asthma, those attending the comparison school missed an average
of 3 more school days (21.3) than those attending schools with an SBHC (18.2).

### Community-Based Asthma Management Program

**Article Citation:**  
Toelle BG, Peat JK, Salome CM, Mellis CM, Bauman AE, Woolock AJ. Evaluation of
a community-based asthma management program in a population sample of
schoolchildren. Med J Australia June 1993;158(11):742-746.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Parent and child educational sessions were held at the child's school.

**Target Population:**  
Children with asthma aged 8-11 attending randomly selected schools

**Program Description:**  
A community-based management program designed to improve outcomes for children
with asthma in Sydney, Australia

The program targeted children and those responsible for the participating
children: parents, pharmacists, doctors, community clinic nurses, and school
teachers. Children and parents attended two 2-hour educational sessions. The
first session explained asthma as a disease to help parents and children
identify symptoms and triggers and use medication more effectively. The second
session emphasized the importance of monitoring airway function and the use of
a written asthma management plan. Doctors and pharmacists attended an evening
workshop explaining the development and use of written asthma management
plans. School teachers and community nurses received an in-service session
about asthma symptoms and triggers.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Children with asthma from randomly selected schools participated in the
intervention group. Children with asthma from schools in a selected geographic
area served as controls. Baseline data were collected on both groups of
children. Knowledge of asthma and morbidity were asked of parents via
questionnaire. Follow-up data were collected three months and six months after
educational sessions were completed. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and
paired t-tests.

**Sample Size:**  
120 children (65 in the intervention group and 55 in the control group)

147 teachers and community nurses, 53 families, 15 pharmacists and 11 doctors
attended the educational sessions.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Although morbidity varied, most of the participating children had mild asthma.
The outcome measures in this study were lung function as measured by forced
expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) bronchial responsiveness to histamine
and airflow variability. The prevalence of symptoms such as wheezing or night
coughs, the number of doctor and emergency room visits, and days absent from
school due to asthma were also measured. At six months, bronchial hyper-
responsiveness and night cough were significantly reduced and FEV1 was
improved compared to both baseline measurements and the control group.
Unscheduled (emergency) visits were reduced in both the intervention and
control groups. Days absent from school did not change in either group.

### Inner-city School-based Health Center Program

**Article Citation:**  
Lurie N, Bauer EJ, Brady C. Asthma outcomes at an inner-city school-based
health center. Journal of School Health 2001;71(1):9-16.

**Intervention Setting:**  
A health clinic in a large, inner-city elementary school

**Target Population:**  
Minority children aged 6-14 years with asthma attending an inner-city
elementary school

**Program Description:**  
An initial sample survey of 400 students indicated that approximately 17% of
children in the school had asthma. School-wide screening then identified all
the students with asthma. Families of these children were interviewed to
assess asthma symptoms and morbidity. Children were then grouped into three
categories based on severity. Those classified with severe or moderate asthma
were prioritized for immediate intervention at the school health center. The
initial visit consisted of confirming the asthma diagnosis by history,
physical exam, and spirometry. Individualized information about asthma
management, medications, and environmental control (based on parental
knowledge) was provided in individual sessions to parents and children by a
health educator. Asthma education group sessions were also held at the school
for students and parents. An asthma symptom-control plan was developed for
each child without a plan, and each child received a written asthma plan that
included the use of rescue medications. Health center staff attempted to
identify a primary-care provider (PCP) for each child and encouraged each
family to obtain regular asthma checkups with that provider. Health center
staff communicated their findings regarding the asthma diagnosis and the care
plan to the PCP. All children with severe and moderate asthma were prescribed
anti-inflammatory medications. Inhaler technique was emphasized, and spacers
and peak flow meters were provided. Children experiencing asthma symptoms
during the school day could go to the health center on a walk-in basis or by
referral from the school nurse. Asthma care in the health center was tailored
to individual need. Many high-risk students with compliance issues began
taking their daily anti-inflammatory medication at school.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This study used a pre- and post-intervention comparison with longitudinal and
cross-sectional cohort of children. A baseline survey completed by parents
addressed self-rated health, asthma-related symptoms the prior 3 months,
asthma morbidity, asthma management practices, home environment, demographic
characteristics, health insurance, and health care use in the prior 3 months.
Baseline data were collected at the beginning of the school year and again
about 9 months later.

**Sample Size:**  
This intervention comprised 156 children with asthma who attended the same
school, had physician-diagnosed asthma, had asthma symptoms such as wheezing
and nocturnal coughs within the past 12 months, and were taking asthma
medication. The sample included all children in the baseline who remained in
school through the study period as well as children who entered school during
the year after the baseline screening and the beginning of the intervention
and were enrolled in school for at least 6 months of the study year.

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Outcome measures included school absenteeism, hospitalization rates for
asthma, outpatient visits for asthma in the absence of asthma symptoms,
percentage of students seeing a specialist for asthma, use of peak flow
meters, use of asthma-care plans, use of inhalers, and school absenteeism. The
percentage of students who were patients overnight in a hospital because of
asthma during the prior 12 months decreased from 15% to 3% for the
longitudinal population and from 10% to 2% for the cross-sectional sample, a
reduction of 75%-80%. School absenteeism associated with asthma did not
change. Parents reported substantially fewer nights that the child awakened
because of asthma and substantially fewer days the family had to change plans
because of the child's asthma. The mean number of scheduled well-child
physician visits significantly decreased. The percentage of students who ever
visited a specialist for asthma markedly increased, and children were more
likely to use a peak flow meter and take appropriate medications.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Elementary schools

**Target Population:**  
Predominantly low-income African American and Latino children between the ages
of 8 and 11 years old

**Program Description:**  
The Open Airways program, originally designed for delivery in health care
settings with predominantly African American and Latino children from
underserved communities, was adapted for delivery in the New York City school
system. The program, which is grounded in social learning theory, consisted of
six group sessions where children learned basic information about asthma, how
to recognize symptoms and triggers, how to use medicine effectively and how to
handle problems at school. Parents were also mailed educational materials.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Twelve schools were chosen. Schools were matched in pairs as closely as
possible on demographic characteristics. Of the 6 pairs, one school was
randomly assigned to the control group and one to the intervention group.
Multivariate and univariate analyses of covariance were used to analyze the
data.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 239 children, of which 135 were in the intervention group and 105
were in the control group.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included changes in behavior, changes in feelings expressed
by children, school attendance, school performance, frequency of asthma
episodes, and the number of attacks requiring a doctor visit or treatment at
home. Participants showed significant improvement in school performance, self-
management behaviors and decreased number of episodes.

**Availability of Protocol/Materials:**  
Open Airways for Schools is disseminated through local American Lung
Association (ALA) affiliates. Individuals and organizations interested in
implementing the program or serving as instructors in the schools should
contact ALA at 1-800-LUNG-USA. Collaborating organizations and instructors
receive training in the curriculum and are expected to stay in contact with
the Lung Association for technical assistance and results reporting.

**Program Description:**  
The purpose of the study was to determine whether The Roaring Adventures of
Puff (RAP), an interactive childhood asthma education program, improved asthma
management behaviors and health status, and quality of life in elementary
school children. The RAP intervention schools received parent and teacher
asthma awareness events, recommendations for school asthma guidelines, and six
educational sessions for the children with asthma. Children in the control
schools received regular medical care. Using the 300-page manual, the
instructors taught six 60-minute asthma educational sessions. Topics by
session number included

Sessions were held during the students' lunch hour. Teaching strategies
included puppetry, games, role play, model building, discussions, and asthma
diary recording. The puppet is a dinosaur named Puff who has asthma. Puff
interacts with the children, instructing them on what to do to better control
their own asthma. Puff is featured in the workbook that children complete
during the week between sessions, share with their parents at home, and use in
class. Over the course of the instructional period, the instructor worked with
teachers and parents as needed for individual child asthma concerns and with
teachers and principals to develop practical school guidelines for asthma.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This study was a cohort, pre-post intervention design. The study compared
children with asthma in randomly assigned intervention schools with those in
control schools. The unit of randomization was the school. All participating
students in each school were assigned to the same group. Children, however,
were the primary unit of analysis. All children with asthma in the
intervention and control schools and their parents completed questionnaires at
the beginning of the project and following the intervention. Questionnaires
included the pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire, parent's RAP
questionnaire, and the childhood asthma self-efficacy scale. The RAP
questionnaire assessed demographic information, perception of their child's
symptom severity, medication use, health care utilization, school absenteeism,
and attitudes toward asthma. The primary analysis compared pre-intervention
and post-intervention outcomes for the children with asthma receiving the
education program and those not receiving the program.

**Sample Size:**  
This study involved 76 children in the intervention group and 86 in the
control group. The two groups, including those who dropped out, were
comparable for demographic and disease related variables.

**Outcome Measures:**  
Unscheduled doctor visits in the last year, emergency department visits in the
last year, missed school days, asthma symptoms, limited type and amount of
play.

**Results:**  
For most indicators of asthma control, the intervention group improved after
the RAP intervention. Statistically significant improvements for the
intervention group included over-all parent-rated severity, unscheduled
physician visits in the last year, moderate-to-severe shortness of breath,
limitations in the kind of play, and any missed school days in the last year.

**Details:**  
In the year before RAP, 76.2% of the intervention children had unscheduled
doctor visits. Followup after RAP showed that 33.8% of RAP participants had
unscheduled doctor visits. Before RAP, 87.7% of intervention children missed
some school because of asthma. Post intervention followup showed that 38.5% of
children missed some school because of asthma. Some characteristics of asthma
improved at followup among the controls, whereas others remained the same or
got worse. Unscheduled physician visits and any missed school days were the
only statistically significant improvements also seen in the control group.
However, the improvement in the control group was just over half that of the
RAP group for both variables. Although not significant, the reduction in the
number of emergency visits in the RAP group was more than twice that of the
control group. The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement
in use of appropriate medication for relief of symptoms (20.6% improvement)
and preventing symptoms (31.4% improvement) at followup, in contrast to the
control group of (17.4% and 3.7%, respectively).
