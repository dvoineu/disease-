### NCIRD Mission

The mission of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases
(NCIRD) is the prevention of disease, disability, and death through
immunization and by control of respiratory and related diseases.

Our challenge is to effectively balance our efforts in the domestic and global
arenas as well as accommodate the specific needs of all populations at risk of
vaccine preventable diseases from children to older adults.
