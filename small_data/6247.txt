Each year CDC releases the Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps for all 50 states,
the District of Columbia, and US territories. The maps show self-reported
adult obesity prevalence by race, ethnicity, and location. The data comes from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an on-going state-based,
telephone interview survey conducted by CDC and state health departments.

The 2018 maps show that obesity impacts some groups more than others. There
are notable differences by race and ethnicity, as shown by combined data from
2016-2018:

Notes on Language and Images:

We encourage the use of person-first language (e.g., "adults with obesity" or
"20% of children ages 12-19 have obesity" and not "obese adults" nor "20% of
children are obese") when discussing topics like obesity and other chronic
diseases, as well as respectful images.

#### Changed System, New Baseline

Like all public health surveillance systems, BRFSS must occasionally change
its methods to adapt to the changing world and to maintain validity. The
improvement changes to the BRFSS affect obesity prevalence estimates, and mean
that estimates from data collected in 2010 and before cannot be compared
estimates from data collected in 2011 and forward. Learn more about the
changes to the BRFSS.
