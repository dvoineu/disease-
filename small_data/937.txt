MERS represents a very low risk to the general public in this country. Only
two patients in the U.S. have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV infection--
both in May 2014--while more than 1,300 have tested negative. CDC continues to
closely monitor the situation.

In May 2014, CDC confirmed two unlinked imported cases of MERS in the United
States--one to Indiana, the other to Florida. Both cases were among healthcare
providers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia. Both traveled to the U.S. from
Saudi Arabia, where scientists believe they were infected. Both were
hospitalized in the U.S. and later discharged after fully recovering.

CDC and other public health partners continue to closely monitor the MERS
situation. We recognize the potential for MERS-CoV to spread further and cause
more cases in the United States and globally. In preparation for this, we
