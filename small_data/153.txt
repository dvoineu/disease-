_Giardia_ is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal illness known as
giardiasis. _Giardia_ (also known as _Giardia intestinalis_ , _Giardia
lamblia_ , or _Giardia duodenalis_ ) is found on surfaces or in soil, food, or
water that has been contaminated with feces (poop) from infected humans or
animals.

_Giardia_ is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the
body for long periods of time and makes it tolerant to chlorine disinfection.
While the parasite can be spread in different ways, water (drinking water and
recreational water) is the most common mode of transmission.
