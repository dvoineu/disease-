Economics is the study of decisions--the incentives that lead to them, and the
consequences from them--as they relate to production, distribution, and
consumption of goods and services when resources are limited and have
alternative uses. CDC uses economics to identify, measure, value, and compare
the costs and consequences of alternative prevention strategies.
