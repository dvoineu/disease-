Strategy: Integrate Screening for Tobacco Use into Behavioral Health Treatment

Tobacco Use - photo of a doctor taking notes on a clipboard from his

The Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust (TSET) works to reduce tobacco
use in the state using funds from the Master Settlement Agreement.1 In 2011,
TSET brought together Oklahoma's Department of Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) and State Department of Health to develop a plan to
address tobacco use among behavioral health clients and providers. After this
meeting, facilitated by the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center, TSET awarded
grants to health system partners to help put the plan in place.2

![Screening for Tobacco Use in Behavioral Health Treatment Facilities,
Oklahoma and United States, 2016 - Oklahoma has 75% of mental health treatment
facilities asking patients about tobacco use compared to 48.9% for the U.S.
overall.  Oklahoma has 81.9% of substance use disorder treatment facilities
asking patients about tobacco use compared to 64% for the U.S.
overall.](/tobacco/disparities/promising-policies-and-
practices/images/oklahoma-graph-mobile-500x800.jpg)

Over a five-year period, Oklahoma took the following steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Trained behavioral health providers about tobacco and the state's plan to reduce tobacco use,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Required state-funded behavioral health facilities to have tobacco-free policies for staff and clients and show plans for enforcing the policies,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Required state-funded behavioral health facilities to implement the "5 A's" (five steps for clinicians to help people quit tobacco: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange3) or to refer clients who use tobacco to the state quitline, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Required state-funded behavioral health providers to track the number of clients they referred to the quitline and increase the proportion of clients referred each year.

ODMHSAS staff say that these steps helped change the culture around tobacco
use in behavioral health treatment settings in Oklahoma. After ODMHSAS took
these steps, Oklahoma changed its behavioral health treatment regulations. Now
Oklahoma law requires that the above measures be taken by all substance use
disorder treatment facilities and all state-funded or state-certified mental
health facilities. ODMHSAS is now focusing on reducing tobacco use among
clients at all mental health facilities in the state - even if these
facilities are not state-certified or state-funded - to help improve health.

This effort appears to be making an impact: Oklahoma has the highest
proportion of mental health treatment facilities offering cessation
counseling, offering non-nicotine cessation medications, and providing smoke-
free campuses in the U.S. ODMHSAS staff report that only 45% of persons with a
mental health condition who were served by ODMHSAS smoked in 2017, down from
71% in 2011. During this same timeframe, the proportion of persons with a
substance use disorder served by ODMHSAS that smoked fell from 77% to 51%.
