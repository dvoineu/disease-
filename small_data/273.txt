If you are interested in implementing CHOICES in your setting, here are some
initial items to consider in determining your readiness. **Topic** |
**Questions to Consider**  
---|---  
**Target Population** |

                      * Do we serve women of reproductive age (18-44 years)?
                      * What do we know about our female clients' alcohol use and contraceptive behavior? Are they at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy?
                      * Are there potential barriers to clients' participation such as time, or lack of trust that need to be addressed before implementing CHOICES?  
**Resources** |

                      * What resources (staff time, space, equipment, technology, etc.) are needed?
                      * Do we need to hire anyone?
                      * What funding and other resources do we have to implement the intervention?  
**Skill Sets** |

                      * What skills are needed to implement CHOICES?
                      * What are the skills and expertise of our team?  
**Support for the  
Program** |

                      * Who are the key decision-makers (administrators, clinic staff, etc.) in our clinic? Do they understand the problem of alcohol-exposed pregnancies? Are awareness and education activities needed to help them understand the problem?
                      * Who are the partners or other key stakeholders, internally and externally, that can support the planning and implementation of the intervention?
