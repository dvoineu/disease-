### Social_round_twitterOverview

Micro-blogging is a form of blogging that allows users to send brief text
updates to a Web site that aggregates these messages for viewing by friends or
the public. These messages can be submitted by a variety of means, including
text messages, mobile Web sites, audio formats, or the Web site hosting the
micro-blog. While several micro-blogging sites exist, CDC currently
participates only in Twitter.

Twitter is an online micro-blogging and social networking Web site that is
used to provide information, commentary and descriptions of events and
highlight certain audio or video content. Twitter users send updates, or
"tweets," that are 280 characters or less in length. Individual users can
"follow" another users' updates.

CDC encourages the strategic use of Twitter to effectively and inexpensively
reach individuals and partners with timely health and safety information.
