##  Definition of Terms

Let's start by defining several basic terms:

**Immunity:** Protection from an infectious disease. If you are immune to a
disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected.

**Vaccine:** A product that stimulates a person's immune system to produce
immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.
Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but can also be
administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.

**Vaccination:** The act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce
immunity to a specific disease.

**Immunization:** A process by which a person becomes protected against a
disease through vaccination. This term is often used interchangeably with
vaccination or inoculation.
