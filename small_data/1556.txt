Recommendations for Providing Quality STD Clinical Services (or STD QCS)
highlights the services healthcare settings can offer to provide the highest-
quality STD care to their patients. The recommendations are **designed to go
hand-in-hand with theSTD Treatment Guidelines** - STD QCS can help guide
clinical operations, while the Treatment Guidelines focus on the clinical
management of patients. Healthcare professionals can use the recommendations
to identify opportunities to build, maintain, or enhance the delivery of their
services.
