An estimated 283,000 children seek care in U.S. emergency departments each
year for a sports- or recreation-related traumatic brain injury (SRR-TBI),
according to a new MMWR Report. The article, Emergency Department Visits for
Sports and Recreation-Related Traumatic Brain Injuries Among Children--United
States, 2010-2016, also found that contact sports contributed to nearly half
(45%) of the SRR-TBI visits examined. Activities with the highest number of
SRR-TBI visits included: football, bicycling, basketball, playground
activities, and soccer.
