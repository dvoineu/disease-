On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the ''Notification and Federal Employee
Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,'' which is now known as the No
FEAR Act. One purpose of the No FEAR Act is to ''require that Federal agencies
be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower
protection laws.'' Pub. L. 107-174, Summary. In support of this purpose,
Congress found that ''agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies
practice or tolerate discrimination.'' Pub. L. 107- 74, Title I, General
Provisions, section 101(1).

The Act also requires this agency to provide this notice to Federal employees,
former Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment to inform them
of their rights and protections. All CDC/ATSDR staff is required to complete a
mandatory No FEAR Act training. CDC/ATSDR is committed to complying with the
polices, regulations and procedures as outlined in the Act.
