Strategy: Counsel Behavioral Health Clients to Quit Using Tobacco

Counseling to Help Clients Quit - photo of a day in the calendar that says
Quit Smoking! and a hand highlighting that day with a marker signifying the

The Hawaii Department of Health Tobacco Prevention and Education Program
(TPEP) surveyed behavioral health programs to learn more about their current
cessation practices. Some steps that TPEP took to address tobacco use among
persons with behavioral health conditions and increase counseling in Hawaii
include:

![Behavioral Health Treatment Facilities Offering Counseling to Help People
Quit Tobacco, Hawaii and United States, 2016 - Hawaii has 62% of mental health
treatment facilities offering counseling to help people quit tobacco compared
to 37.6% for the U.S. overall.  Hawaii has 66.7% of substance use disorder
treatment facilities offering counseling to help people quit tobacco compared
to 47.4% for the U.S. overall.](/tobacco/disparities/promising-policies-and-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Conducted a workshop for those same participants with a national expert on addressing tobacco use among persons with behavioral health conditions, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Worked with the state Attorney General's Office to clarify that a state law allowing minors to consent to substance use disorder treatment without a parent's permission also applies to tobacco cessation treatment, resulting in the state quitline and health providers being able to offer nicotine addiction counseling to more youth.

The SAMHSA surveys show that Hawaii has a high proportion of both mental
health treatment facilities and substance use disorder treatment facilities
offering tobacco cessation counseling to clients.1
