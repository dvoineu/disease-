# Vaccines: The Basics

Minus

Related Pages

Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles
vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But
they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don't make you
sick. Some vaccines contain only a _part_ of the disease germ.

A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it
would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you
develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.

This is what makes vaccines such powerful medicine. Unlike most medicines,
which treat or cure diseases, vaccines _prevent_ them.
