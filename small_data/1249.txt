_Baylisascaris_ infection is caused by a roundworm found in raccoons. This
roundworm can infect people as well as a variety of other animals, including
dogs. Human infections are rare, but can be severe if the parasites invade the
eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans) or the brain
(neural larva migrans).
