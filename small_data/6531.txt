_N. meningitidis_ are gram-negative, coffee-bean shaped diplococci that may
occur intracellularly or extracellularly in PMN leukocytes. _N. meningitidis_
is a fastidious organism, which grows best at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a
candle-jar). It can grow on both a blood agar plate (BAP) and a chocolate agar
plate (CAP). Colonies of _N. meningitidis_ are grey and unpigmented on a BAP
and appear round, smooth, moist, glistening, and convex, with a clearly
defined edge. _N. meningitidis_ appear as large, colorless-to-grey, opaque
colonies on a CAP. Prior to identification and characterization testing
procedures, isolates should always be inspected for purity of growth and a
single colony should be re-streaked, when necessary, to obtain a pure culture.
For the following identification and characterization procedures, testing
should be performed on 18-24 hour growth from a BAP (Figure 1) or a CAP
(Figure 2) at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).

The following tests are recommended to confirm the identity of cultures that
morphologically appear to be _N. meningitidis_ (Figure 3). _N. meningitidis_
can be identified using Kovac's oxidase test and carbohydrate utilization. If
the oxidase test is positive, carbohydrate utilization testing should be
performed. If the carbohydrate utilization test indicates that the isolate may
be _N. meningitidis_ , serological tests to identify the serogroup should be
performed. This sequence of testing is an efficient way to save costly
antisera and time. Additional methods for identification and characterization
of _N. meningitidis_ using molecular tools are described in Chapter 10: PCR
Methods and Chapter 12: Molecular Methods.

Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) practices are required for work involving isolates
of _N. meningitidis_ , as this organism presents a potential hazard to
laboratory personnel and the surrounding working environment. Please refer to
Chapter 4: Biosafety in order to follow the guidelines that have been
established for laboratorians working in BSL-2 facilities as many of the tests
described in this chapter require opening plates with live cultures and are
often performed outside of a biosafety cabinet (BSC). molecular tools are
described in Chapter 10: PCR Methods and Chapter 12: Molecular Methods.

Kovac's oxidase testKovac's oxidase test determines the presence of cytochrome oxidase. Kovac's oxidase reagent, tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, is turned into a purple compound by organisms containing cytochrome c as part of their respiratory chain. This test aids in the recognition of _N. meningitidis_ , but other members of the genus _Neisseria,_ as well as unrelated bacterial species, may also give a positive reaction. Positive and negative quality control (QC) strains should be tested along with the unknown isolates to ensure that the oxidase reagent is working properly.

Preparation of 1% oxidase reagent from oxidase powderTo prevent deterioration of stock oxidase powder, the powder should be stored in a tightly sealed desiccator and kept in a cool, dark area. Kovac's oxidase reagent is intended only for _in vitro_ diagnostic use. Avoid contact with the eyes and skin as it can cause irritation. In case of accidental contact, immediately flush eyes or skin with water for at least 15 minutes.

Carbohydrate utilization by _N. meningitidis_ : cystine trypticase agar (CTA) methodCarbohydrate utilization tests are used to validate the identification of a strain as _N. meningitidis_. For this procedure, 4 different carbohydrates (glucose [also called dextrose], maltose, lactose, and sucrose) are added to tubes containing a CTA base for a final concentration of 1%. A phenol red indicator is also included in the medium. It is a sensitive indicator that develops a yellow color in the presence of acid at a pH of 6.8 or less. A panel of four tubes, each containing a different carbohydrate, is used to test each isolate. _Neisseria_ spp. produce acid from carbohydrates by oxidation, not fermentation. _N. meningitidis_ oxidizes glucose and maltose, but not lactose or sucrose. While it is extremely rare, strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been reported to either utilize glucose or maltose, but not both. Well-characterized QC strains should be tested along with the unknown isolates to ensure that the CTA sugars are working properly. _N. meningitidis_ and/or _N. lactamica_ isolates should be used to QC the CTA sugar media. Methods for preparation of the CTA sugar media are included in the Annex. CTA sugars should be stored at 4°C and warmed to room temperature (25°C) before use.

Reading the CTA sugar resultsDevelopment of visible turbidity and a yellow color in the upper portion of the medium indicates growth of bacteria and production of acid and is interpreted as a positive test (Figure 5). Although reactions may occur as early as 24 hours after inoculation, some reactions are delayed and negative results should not be interpreted before 72 hours of incubation. A color change to yellow without turbidity is usually not a positive reaction. Carbohydrate utilization results for differentiating _N. meningitidis_ from other _Neisseria_ spp. and bacteria are listed in Table 1.

Identification of _N. meningitidis_ serogroupTwelve serogroups, based on the biochemical composition of capsular polysaccharides, are currently recognized: A, B, C, H, I, K, L, W135, X, Y, Z, and 29E (Z'). Serogroup D is no longer recognized as a serogroup. Serogroups A, B, C, W135 and Y are the 5 most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Serogroup A has been the most common cause of epidemics in Africa and Asia. Serogroups C, W135, and X have also been reported as causes of epidemics in several parts of Africa as well. Serogroup-specific antisera for these major serogroups are available commercially.It is not always practical to test for all serogroups for which antisera are available in a laboratory. Testing algorithms may be set up in laboratories with previous knowledge of the predominance or lack of serogroups within that particular geographic region in order to test for the most common serogroups first. Modifications may be made to the testing algorithm for any laboratory based on information about current strains that are circulating in the region. For example, in Africa, testing with antisera for serogroups A and W135 (and X in some regions) as well as with a saline control to detect nonspecific autoagglutination should be adequate to characterize most case isolates. Strains reacting negatively with A, W135, and X antisera should then be tested with other available antisera, particularly C, Y, and B. Nearly all case isolates are serogroupable, if they are tested against a comprehensive panel of antisera and proper controls are used. In rare instances, an isolate that does not react with any of the serogroup-specific antisera or reacts with more than one serogroup-specific antisera is considered nongroupable (NG). Polyvalent antisera containing combinations of serogroups (e.g., A, B, and C or X, Y, W135, and Z) may also be used.It is essential that reference laboratories have the capacity to isolate, identify, and characterize the serogroup of isolates of _N. meningitidis_. This valuable data provides laboratories and public health authorities with the tools to identify outbreaks controllable by vaccination campaigns, recognize serogroups causing sporadic disease, and detect emergence of new outbreak strains.

Slide agglutination serogrouping (SASG) test for serogrouping _N. meningitidis_ isolatesFormalin-killed meningococcal suspensions should be used for SASG testing rather than saline suspensions of living organisms to maintain a safe working environment. A solution of 5% formalinized physiological saline is sufficient to kill the bacteria. However, formalin is a carcinogen and must be stored and handled with great care. Alternatively, work should be performed under a biosafety hood if formalin is not used. Antisera should be stored in the refrigerator at 4°C and warmed to room temperature (25°C) before use. It must be put back in the refrigerator as soon as testing is finished to prevent the loss of binding activity of the antibody.

Suspend the bacteria in the 5% formalinized saline solution in the lower portion of each of the sections of the slide. The suspension should be moderately opaque (see saline control in Figure 6). Do not allow the cell suspension to dry before adding the antisera.

Add 10 µl of this suspension to the lower portion of the slide.

Gently tilt the slide to mix the cell suspensions with the antisera in each section. Continue to gently rock the slide for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the lower and upper portions to completely blend. Do not use a circular motion while rocking, as it can cause the sections with different serogroup-specific antisera to run together and contaminate each other.

Rating the intensity of the agglutination reactionAgglutination occurs when the antisera bind to the bacterial cells causing the cells to agglutinate or clump together, thus making the cell suspension appear clearer. The intensity of the agglutination reaction may vary according to the density of the cell suspension or the antisera used. A description on the intensity ratings shown in Figure 6 are listed below.4+ All of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension appears clear  
3+ 75% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
2+ 50% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
1+ 25% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
+/- Less than 25% of the cells agglutinate and a fine granular matter occurs  
0 No visible agglutination; the suspension remains cloudy and smooth

If the original plate contains different size colonies, make a subculture for each type of colony and test both cultures the next day. The larger colonies usually indicate better capsule production and therefore better reactivity. However, the smaller colonies will occasionally give a better result.

Commercial identification kitsSeveral commercial identification systems that use biochemical or enzymatic substrates are available for identification of _Neisseria_ spp. These systems may occasionally require supplemental tests, and additional characteristics, such as microscopic and colony morphology, must be considered. Generally, each system is self-contained, but the addition of one or more reagents to complete certain reactions may be necessary. The manufacturer's instructions should be followed precisely when using these kits. For detailed instructions and use of appropriate control strains, consult the Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook (2).

Serotyping and serosubtyping of _N. meningitidis_ with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs)Differentiation and classification of bacterial strains at the sub-species level require methods that are highly reproducible, little affected by the experimental conditions, and give effective discrimination of epidemiologically unrelated strains. Further characterization of bacteria causing meningitis is especially important to document the spread of particularly pathogenic clones. Many immunoassays have been developed for serological characterization of _N. meningitidis_ antigens. Immunological detection of specific epitopes of two major outer-membrane proteins, PorB and PorA, is the basis for the serological classification system defining, respectively, the serotypes and serosubtypes of the species 1, 3-7). A simple, low cost method for serotyping and serosubtyping meningococci, dot-blotting with Mabs, is described below.
