Giardiasis is a diarrheal illness caused by the parasite _Giardia
intestinalis_ (also known as _Giardia lamblia_ or _Giardia duodenalis_ ). A
parasite is an organism that feeds off of another to survive.

Giardiasis is a global disease. It infects nearly 2% of adults and 6% to 8% of
children in developed countries worldwide. Nearly 33% of people in developing
countries have had giardiasis. In the United States, _Giardia_ infection is
the most common intestinal parasitic disease affecting humans 1.

People become infected with _Giardia_ by swallowing _Giardia_ cysts (hard
shells containing _Giardia_ ) found in contaminated food or water. Cysts are
instantly infectious once they leave the host through feces (poop) 2. An
infected person might shed 1-10 billion cysts daily in their feces (poop) and
this might last for several months 2,6,7. However, swallowing as few as 10
cysts might cause someone to become ill 2,6. _Giardia_ may be passed from
person-to-person or even from animal-to-person 2,3. Also, oral-anal contact
during sex has been known to cause infection 4,5. Symptoms of giardiasis
normally begin 1 to 3 weeks after a person has been infected 6.

_Giardia_ infection rates have been known to go up in late summer 8-10.
Between 2006-2008 in the United States, known cases of giardiasis were twice
as high between June-October as they were between January-March 2.

Anyone may become infected with _Giardia_. However, those at greatest risk are
2,11-16:

The risk of humans acquiring _Giardia_ infection from dogs or cats is small
17-19,13. The exact type of _Giardia_ that infects humans is usually not the
same type that infects dogs and cats 17,18,13.

Molecular Characterization

_Giardia intestinalis_ (aka: _G. duodenalis, G. lamblia)_ can be subdivided
based on molecular analysis into what are known as different genetic
assemblages (A,B,C,D,E,F, and G). Some of these assemblages can be classified
even further into subtypes like for example A-I, A-II, A-III, A-IV. Each
assemblage is capable of infecting certain species, and some assemblages are
more commonly seen than others 18,20,21.

Molecular Characterization  
---  
Assemblages | Some Species Commonly Infected  
A-I | Humans and animals (cats, dogs, livestock, deer, muskrats, beavers,
voles, guinea pigs, ferrets)  
A-II | Humans (more common than A-I)  
A-III and A-IV | Exclusively animals  
B | Humans and animals (livestock, chinchillas, beavers, marmosets, rodents)  
C and D | Dogs, coyotes  
E | Alpacas, cattle, goats, pigs, sheep  
F | Cats
