Know how to stay healthy and where to find help in an emergency.

The Basics

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Use generators safely--outside, in a dry area, and at least 20 feet from any window, door, or vent to prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Wash your hands to prevent the spread of disease after a flood. Hand sanitizers are not effective when hands are visibly dirty, and do not eliminate all types of germs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Make an asthma management plan that identifies your known asthma triggers, describes your daily treatment (such as what kind of medicines to take and when to take them), and explains when to call the doctor or go to the emergency room.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Check that smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are working and placed throughout the house. Portable generators produce CO, which is odorless, colorless, tasteless, and can cause illness and death. Learn practical skills, like how to use generators safely in a power outage.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Create custom go-kits out of rolling luggage, a backpack, a duffle bag, or a pillowcases for every member of your household to prepare for an evacuation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Put appliance thermometers in your freezer and fridge to help you determine if the food is safe after a power outage.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Quick Tips

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Keep wounds clean and covered with a waterproof bandage around floodwater to reduce the chance of infection. Floodwater can spread bacteria such as tetanus and Vibro vulnificus and diseases like leptospirosis.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Do NOT share prescription drugs. Doctors prescribe and dose medications with a person's particular illness, drug interactions, and medical history in mind.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Use bottled water to reconstitute prescription drugs if clean tap water is unavailable. Unopened commercially bottled water is the safest and most reliable source of water in an emergency.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * If a life depends on the refrigerated drug, but the medications have been at room temperature, use them only until a new supply is available. Replace all refrigerated drugs as soon as possible.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Take health-related personal items such as prescription medications and medical supplies with you in an evacuation. Do NOT assume an evacuation shelter can provide for your unique health needs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Double-check the setting on your medical device(s) after a power outage. An outage can cause medical devices to reset to their default or factory settings.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Dialysis patients: Follow a 3-Day Emergency Dietpdf iconexternal icon to limit the buildup of water, protein wastes, and potassium if you are on dialysis but cannot get treatments.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Identify emergency departments, urgent cares, dialysis centers, hemophilia treatment centers, veterinarians, etc. near your home and emergency meeting places, and along your designated evacuation route.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Register with your local government if you may need evacuation assistance in an emergency because of a lack of transportation, or a medical or mobility issue.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Contact your water and power companies to get on a "priority reconnection service" list of power-dependent customers if you rely on electrical medical equipment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People with disabilities: Conduct a self-assessment. Know what you can and cannot do. Talk with your health care provider about a realistic plan.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People who use durable medical equipment: Show people in your support network, including family and friends, how to operate and maintain your medical devices.

Americans with Disabilities

More than 56 million Americans--19 percent of the population--live with some
form of disability. Of those who self-report a disability, half say they have
trouble walking and climbing stairs. Either issue could make it difficult to
evacuate in an emergency. People with mobility disabilities can take the
following steps to prepare for an emergency evacuation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Form a personal support network of family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers who can help you create communication and transportation plans in case of an evacuation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Assess your evacuation needs and capabilities. Pre-identify two escape routes out of every room and two evacuation routes from home and work.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Contact your local fire department and emergency management office to self-identify as someone who needs transportation assistance in an evacuation.
