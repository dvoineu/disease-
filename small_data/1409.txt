Strategy: Offer Behavioral Health Clients Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)

During 2013-2017, the Taking Texas Tobacco Free (TTTF) project, with funding
from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, partnered with 22
community mental health treatment centers (representing over 250 individual
clinics) to put comprehensive and sustainable tobacco-free programs in place
in Texas. The goal was to reduce tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure
among employees, clients, and visitors by adopting tobacco-free campus
policies, screening employees and clients regularly for tobacco use, and
providing counseling and NRT to tobacco users who want to quit.

Over the four-year period:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * TTTF staff trained employees providing direct clinical care about how NRT and non-nicotine cessation medication can help people quit tobacco,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * TTTF staff provided tobacco dependence training to 150 of the employees providing direct clinical care,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Over 15,000 individual boxes of nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges were provided to mental health treatment clinic clients and staff.1

Texas has the highest proportion of mental health treatment facilities that
offer NRT.2 The Texas Department of State Health Services Tobacco Prevention
and Control Program has said that providing "starter supplies" of NRT to
behavioral health centers has made a difference; it has been easier for these
facilities to implement tobacco-free campus policies and put in place
processes to consistently screen clients for tobacco use because they have
cessation tools on hand to support quit attempts. TTTF is now implementing a
similar program with 18 substance use disorder treatment centers.
