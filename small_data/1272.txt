Lymphatic filariasis, considered globally as a neglected tropical disease
(NTD), is a parasitic disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms. The
adult worms only live in the human lymph system. The lymph system maintains
the body's fluid balance and fights infections. Lymphatic filariasis is spread
from person to person by mosquitoes.

People with the disease can suffer from lymphedema and elephantiasis and in
men, swelling of the scrotum, called hydrocele. Lymphatic filariasis is a
leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Communities frequently shun
and reject women and men disfigured by the disease. Affected people frequently
are unable to work because of their disability, and this harms their families
and their communities.
