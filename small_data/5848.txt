The approach to Zika virus testing on fixed tissue specimens continues to evolve as more is learned regarding this emerging virus. Currently, Zika virus testing on fixed tissues includes Zika virus reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on placental and fetal tissues, Zika virus immunohistochemistry (IHC) on selected cases including placental tissues from 1st and early 2nd trimester pregnancy losses, fetal tissues from pregnancy losses, and autopsy tissues from infant deaths. Microscopic examination of submitted tissues is also performed in selected cases.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2. Fixed tissues may include formalin-fixed wet tissues and/or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are preferred if formalin-fixation of the wet tissues has exceeded two weeks. Wet tissues fixed in formalin for more than four weeks **_are not acceptable_** for Zika virus testing.

Collecting tissues with the recommended dimensions provided in the table above will allow formalin to penetrate the specimen and increase the chances for appropriate tissue fixation.

The volume of formalin used to fix tissues should be 10x the volume of tissue. Place tissue collected according to the dimensions provided above in 10% buffered formalin for three days (72 hours). After fixation, if not paraffin-embedded, tissues **SHOULD** be transferred to 70% ethanol for long term storage and for shipping.

Fixed tissues should be stored and shipped at **room temperature.** Additional instructions for collecting, handling, and shipping formalin-fixed tissues are also available. Paraffin blocks should be submitted in accordance with these instructions for formalin-fixed specimens.
