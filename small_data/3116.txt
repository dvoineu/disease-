**Investing to Protect the United States and World against Antibiotic
Resistance**  
Antibiotic resistance (AR), when germs do not respond to the drugs designed to
kill them, threatens to return us to the time when simple infections were
often fatal. CDC is committed to protecting people and the future of the
healthcare, veterinary, and agriculture industries from the threat of
antibiotic resistance.  
  
The AR Investment Map showcases CDCâs critical activities in the United
States and abroad to combat antibiotic resistance with investments in
laboratory and epidemiological expertise and public health innovation.  
  
CDC supports most of these activities through its AR Solutions Initiative,
while also leveraging investments from successful programs across the agency
for maximum efficiency.
