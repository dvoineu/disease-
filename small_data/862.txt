### Travelers' Diarrhea

![woman staring](/travel/images/woman-holding-stomach.jpg)

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common travel-related illness. It can occur
anywhere, but the highest-risk destinations are in Asia (except for Japan and
South Korea) as well as the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South
America.

In otherwise healthy adults, diarrhea is rarely serious or life-threatening,
but it can make a trip very unpleasant.

#### You can take steps to avoid traveler's diarrhea

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * **Choose food and drinks carefully**  
Eat only foods that are cooked and served hot. Avoid food that has been
sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed
them in clean water or peeled them. Only drink beverages from factory-sealed
containers, and avoid ice because it may have been made from unclean water.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * **Wash your hands**  
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom
and before eating. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based
hand sanitizer. In general, it's a good idea to keep your hands away from your
mouth.

#### Learn some ways to treat traveler's diarrhea

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * **Drink lots of fluids**  
If you get diarrhea, drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. In serious cases
of travelers' diarrhea, oral rehydration solution--available online or in
pharmacies in developing countries--can be used for fluid replacements.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * **Take over-the-counter drugs**  
Several drugs, such as loperamide, can be bought over-the-counter to treat the
symptoms of diarrhea. These drugs decrease the frequency and urgency of
needing to use the bathroom, and may make it easier for you to ride on a bus
or airplane while waiting for an antibiotic to take effect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * **Only take antibiotics if needed**  
Your doctor may give you antibiotics to treat traveler's diarrhea, but
consider using them only for severe cases. If you take antibiotics, take them
_exactly_  as your doctor instructs. If severe diarrhea develops soon after
you return from your trip, see a doctor and ask for stool tests so you can
find out which antibiotic will work for you.
