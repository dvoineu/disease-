### Kentucky Health Department Works with Insurers and Pharmacists to Offer
People Medications and Counseling to Quit Using Tobacco Products

Bobbye Gray from the Kentucky Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program is a
registered nurse and a trained expert in helping people quit using tobacco
products. Each year, more than 8,900 people in Kentucky die of smoking-related
illnesses.1 In addition, tobacco-related diseases among Kentuckians result in
Medicaid and Medicare treatment costs of about $1.2 billion per year--or $300
for each of the 4 million people living in Kentucky.2

Bobbye and her tobacco control colleagues wanted to find new ways to reduce
tobacco use among Kentucky's Medicaid enrollees, many of whom have a low
income, are disabled, or live in rural areas of the state.3,4

### Improving Access to Medication to Help People Quit

Kentucky's five health care systems--or Managed Care Organizations
(MCOs)--that serve people insured through Medicaid offered different levels of
insurance coverage for help to quit using tobacco products. Many rural
Kentuckians were unable to get the help they needed to quit because their
insurance did not fully pay for every service. In 2015, the tobacco control
program met with the Kentucky Department for Medicaid Services, the Medicaid
Prevention Network's Tobacco Cessation Affinity Group, and the MCOs to learn
why MCOs were unable to consistently pay for patients to receive medications
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help people quit using
tobacco products. After a series of discussions, these MCOs agreed to cover
all seven FDA-approved medications.

To increase quit rates, the tobacco control program approached the Kentucky
Pharmacy Board in 2016 to discuss options to get help from pharmacists.
Because Kentucky law did not allow pharmacists to prescribe medication to help
people quit, the tobacco control program and the Kentucky Pharmacy Board
helped pharmacists and doctors enter into collaborative care agreements so
that pharmacists could recommend medication and provide brief counseling to
help people quit.5

### Improving Counseling Services to Help People Quit

Working with the MCOs and the Kentucky Pharmacy Board were steps in the right
direction. But people who go to their doctors for help to quit using tobacco
products could be even more successful if they receive counseling in addition
to using medication.6 Many doctors in Kentucky were unaware that tobacco-
related counseling is billable under Medicaid and Medicare. To address that
issue, the tobacco control program and its partners created charts outlining
the coverage provided by MCOs to help people quit and the billing codes for
tobacco-related counseling, which they gave to Kentucky's Medicaid providers.
Knowing which billing codes to use to get paid for counseling patients to quit
may increase the likelihood doctors will offer the service, given the many
demands on their time.

### Making Sure that Everyone in Kentucky Benefits

In 2017, the Kentucky legislature decided to formalize and expand the MCOs'
agreement related to insurance coverage for quitting tobacco. Now, for
consistency, all MCOs, Medicaid, and commercial health plans in Kentucky are
required to provide the tobacco insurance benefits recommended by the US
Preventive Services Task Force--all seven FDA-approved medications and
individual, group, and telephone counseling. In addition, the Kentucky
Pharmacy Board changed its rules in late 2017.7,8 Now, pharmacists can provide
medications without a prescription and do more extensive cessation counseling
to help people quit, without the extra work of entering into collaborative
care agreements with doctors.

These changes resulted from steps that the tobacco control program took with
partners to help Kentuckians get treatment to quit using tobacco. This work
was done with key funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to Kentucky's tobacco control program. Kentucky's efforts are helping to
reduce the toll of tobacco and health care expenses in the Bluegrass state.
