Health care providers play an essential role in recognizing, treating, and
managing epilepsy. This page shares links and resources that health care
providers can use to learn about the latest epilepsy treatment guidelines,
seizure classifications, programs that address mental health problems, and how
to help pediatric patients transition to adult care.

Encourage Self-Management

People with epilepsy can benefit from learning skills and techniques that help
them manage their disorder, its treatment, and its effects so that they can
live full and satisfying lives. Physician support of patient self-management
is a key component of effective chronic illness care. A patient is much more
likely to participate in a self-management program with a recommendation from
a health care professional.

CDC's Managing Epilepsy Well Checklist describes self-management strategies in
detail and can be printed for patients to use at home.

#### Managing Epilepsy Well Network Programs

The Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network is a group of academic Prevention
Research Centers that conduct studies related to epilepsy self-management.
Read how the MEW Network is improving health and quality of life for people
with epilepsy through their research programs, and find resourcesExternal that
you can use in your practice.

Some MEW Network programs are implemented by local Epilepsy Foundation
affiliates. Learn moreExternal about these partnerships and find other
resources from the Epilepsy FoundationExternal for your patients to better
manage their epilepsy.

Address Depression

Depression is common among people with epilepsy and can further reduce quality
of life. Health providers should screen their patients for depression and
offer referrals to mental health professionals when appropriate.1

The MEW Network has developed three programs, PEARLS, Project UPLIFT, and
TIME, that reduce depression in people with epilepsy. Health providers can
become trained to deliver these programs or learn more about programs
available locally.

**PEARLS External **

PEARLS (Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives) is an evidence-based
self-management program designed to reduce depression and improve quality of
life in adults with epilepsy. A mental health counselor provides 6 to 8 skill-
building sessions that take place in a person with epilepsy's home. The
program uses a team-based approach, involving doctors, nurses, and social
workers to help the individual overcome depression.

The PEARLS Program is designed to be part of community-based programs that
deliver care and provide resources to clients. The PEARLS team conducts
several on-site training sessions throughout the year in Seattle, Washington.
Learn more about the PEARLS trainingExternal.

**Project UPLIFT External**

Project UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is
a phone- and web-based program designed to prevent or reduce depression in
people with epilepsy. UPLIFT is based on mindfulness and cognitive therapy,
two techniques proven to help prevent and manage symptoms of depression.  The
program includes eight group sessions with exercises at home between sessions.
UPLIFT is led by two people, one with mental health training and the other
with epilepsy, and supervised by a licensed psychologist.

Free trainingExternal and CEUs are offered to mental health professionals who
want to implement UPLIFT in their community.

**TIME External**

TIME (Targeted Self-Management for Epilepsy and Mental Illness) is a group
treatment program designed to improve epilepsy and mental health for adults
with epilepsy and mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or schizophrenia. A trained nurse
educator and a trained peer educator instruct in-person group sessions over a
10-12 week time period. Individuals have 2 telephone maintenance sessions with
the nurse educator about 2 weeks apart after the group sessions are done.
