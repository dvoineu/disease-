                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The sooner you quit, the sooner your body can begin to heal.1,2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Tobacco smoke harms nonsmokers, too.1,3

Reduced Risk for Various Health Issues1,2

Some benefits of quitting smoking occur quickly; more occur over time. For
example:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Your risk for a heart attack drops sharply just 1 year after you quit smoking.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * After 2 to 5 years, your chance for stroke could fall to about the same as a nonsmoker's.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Within 5 years of quitting, your chance of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder is cut in half.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Risks for other conditions--including ulcer, peripheral artery disease, and cancers of the larynx, lung, and cervix--are reduced after quitting.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The risk of having a low birth weight baby drops to normal if you quit before pregnancy or during your first trimester.
