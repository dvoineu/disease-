###  Stay Healthy and Safe

Learn actions you can take to stay healthy and safe on your trip. Vaccines
cannot protect you from many diseases in Belgium, so your behaviors are
important.



### Eat and drink safely

Food and water standards in Belgium are similar to those in the United States.
Most travelers do not need to take special food or water precautions beyond
what they normally do at home. However, travelers visiting rural or remote
areas that are served by unregulated water sources such as private wells
should take special precautions to ensure the safety of their drinking water.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Protect yourself from UV radiation: use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, wear protective clothing, and seek shade during the hottest time of day (10 a.m.-4 p.m.).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Be especially careful during summer months and at high elevation. Because sunlight reflects off snow, sand, and water, sun exposure may be increased during activities like skiing, swimming, and sailing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Very cold temperatures can be dangerous. Dress in layers and cover heads, hands, and feet properly if you are visiting a cold location.

### Keep away from animals

Most animals avoid people, but they may attack if they feel threatened, are
protecting their young or territory, or if they are injured or ill. Animal
bites and scratches can lead to serious diseases such as rabies.

Follow these tips to protect yourself:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Do not touch or feed _any_ animals you do not know.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Do not allow animals to lick open wounds, and do not get animal saliva in your eyes or mouth.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Avoid rodents and their urine and feces.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Traveling pets should be supervised closely and not allowed to come in contact with local animals.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If you wake in a room with a bat, seek medical care immediately.  Bat bites may be hard to see.

All animals can pose a threat, but be extra careful around dogs, bats,
monkeys, sea animals such as jellyfish, and snakes. If you are bitten or

### Avoid sharing body fluids

Diseases can be spread through body fluids, such as saliva, blood, vomit, and
semen.

Protect yourself:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Use latex condoms correctly.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Do not inject drugs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Limit alcohol consumption. People take more risks when intoxicated.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Do not share needles or any devices that can break the skin. That includes needles for tattoos, piercings, and acupuncture.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If you receive medical or dental care, make sure the equipment is disinfected or sanitized.

### Know how to get medical care while traveling

Plan for how you will get health care during your trip, should the need arise:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Carry a list of local doctors and hospitals at your destination.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Review your health insurance plan to determine what medical services it would cover during your trip.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Pay attention to the traffic around you, especially in crowded areas.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Remember, people on foot do not always have the right of way in other countries.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Make sure there are seatbelts.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Avoid overcrowded, overloaded, top-heavy buses and minivans.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Avoid riding on motorcycles or motorbikes, especially motorbike taxis. (Many crashes are caused by inexperienced motorbike drivers.)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Choose newer vehicles--they may have more safety features, such as airbags, and be more reliable.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Choose larger vehicles, which may provide more protection in crashes.

Think about the driver.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Consider hiring a licensed, trained driver familiar with the area.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Arrange payment before departing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Try to schedule flights during daylight hours and in good weather.

### Healthy Travel Packing List

Use the Healthy Travel Packing List for Belgium for a list of health-related
items to consider packing for your trip. Talk to your doctor about which items
are most important for you.

#### Why does CDC recommend packing these health-related items?

It's best to be prepared to prevent and treat common illnesses and injuries.
Some supplies and medicines may be difficult to find at your destination, may
have different names, or may have different ingredients than what you normally
use.
