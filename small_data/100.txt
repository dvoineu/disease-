Notes on Language and Images:

We encourage the use of person-first language (e.g., "adults with obesity" or
"20% of children ages 12-19 have obesity" and not "obese adults" nor "20% of
children are obese") when discussing topics like obesity and other chronic
diseases, as well as respectful images.
