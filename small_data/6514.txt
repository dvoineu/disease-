_H. influenzae_ are small, pleomorphic, gram-negative bacilli or coccobacilli
with random arrangements. _H. influenzae_ is a fastidious organism which grows
best at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar) and requires hemin (X
factor) and nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD, also known as V factor)
for growth. The standard medium used for growth of _H. influenzae_ is a
chocolate agar plate (CAP), which can be prepared with heat-lysed horse blood,
a good source of both hemin and NAD, although sheep blood can also be used.
Growth occurs on a CAP because NAD is released from the blood during the
heating process of chocolate agar preparation (the heating process also
inactivates growth inhibitors) and hemin is available from non-hemolyzed as
well as hemolyzed blood cells. Alternatively, NAD can be included as a
component of liquid _H. influenzae_ growth media supplements, (available
commercially or prepared in the laboratory), which are incorporated into the
chocolate agar. _H. influenzae_ appear as large, round, smooth, convex,
colorless-to-grey, opaque colonies on a CAP (Figure 1). Encapsulated strains
appear more mucoidal than non-encapsulated strains, which appear as smaller,
compact grey colonies. No hemolysis or discoloration of the CAP is apparent.
While _H. influenzae_ produce a pungent indol smell, plates should not be
opened in order to smell the cultures. _H. influenzae_ cannot grow on an
unsupplemented BAP. Prior to identification and characterization testing
procedures, isolates should always be inspected for purity of growth and a
single colony should be re-streaked, when necessary, to obtain a pure culture.
For the following identification and characterization procedures, testing
should be performed on 18-24 hour growth from a CAP at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2
(or in a candle-jar) (Figure 2).

The following tests are recommended to confirm the identity of cultures that
morphologically appear to be _H. influenzae_ (Figure 3). _H. influenzae_ can
be identified using Kovac's oxidase test and determining the necessity of
hemin and NAD as growth requirements. If the oxidase test is positive, hemin
and NAD growth factor requirement testing should be performed. If the growth
factor requirement test indicates that the isolate may be _H. influenzae_ ,
serological tests to identify the serotype should be performed. This sequence
of testing is an efficient way to save costly antisera and time. Additional
methods for identification and characterization of _H. influenzae_ using
molecular tools are described in Chapter 10: PCR Methods and Chapter 12:
Molecular Methods.

Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) practices are required for work involving isolates
of _H. influenzae_ , as this organism presents a potential hazard to
laboratory personnel and the surrounding working environment. Please refer to
Chapter 4: Biosafety in order to follow the guidelines that have been
established for laboratorians working in BSL-2 facilities as many of the tests
described in this chapter require opening plates with live cultures and are
often performed outside of a biosafety cabinet (BSC).

Kovac's oxidase testKovac's oxidase test determines the presence of cytochrome oxidase. Kovac's oxidase reagent, tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, is turned into a purple compound by organisms containing cytochrome c as part of their respiratory chain. This test aids in the recognition of H. influenzae, but other members of the genus Haemophilus, as well as unrelated bacterial species, may also give a positive reaction. Positive and negative quality control (QC) strains should be tested along with the unknown isolates to ensure that the oxidase reagent is working properly.

Preparation of 1% oxidase reagent from oxidase powderTo prevent deterioration of stock oxidase powder, the powder should be stored in a tightly sealed desiccator and kept in a cool, dark area. Kovac's oxidase reagent is intended only for _in vitro_ diagnostic use. Avoid contact with the eyes and skin as it can cause irritation. In case of accidental contact, immediately flush eyes or skin with water for at least 15 minutes.

Identification of hemin and NAD as growth requirements _H. influenzae_ is a fastidious organism and can be identified on the basis of growth requirements for hemin and NAD. _H. influenzae_ can be differentiated from most other species of _Haemophilus_ by its specific requirement for both hemin and NAD for growth (Table 1). _H. haemolyticus_ is the only other species requiring both hemin and NAD for growth; however, this species differs from _H. influenzae_ by producing beta-hemolysis (clear) on horse or rabbit blood. For patients with bacterial meningitis, _H. influenzae_ must be considered as the presumptive causative agent as opposed to _H. haemolyticus_ when both hemin and NAD factors are required for growth. To differentiate between the two species, hemolysis must be checked on horse or rabbit blood agar (see Section II.B., _Haemophilus_ ID Quad plate section below). _H. haemolyticus_ usually causes hemolysis on these media, while _H. influenzae_ does not. It has recently been reported that _H. haemolyticus_ tend to rapidly lose their hemolytic property when passed _in vitro_ (2). This has made the definitive identification of _H. influenzae_ and _H. haemolyticus_ using only biochemical tests very difficult and other methods, such as molecular testing, may be employed for differentiating between the two species.

### Footnotes

1 _H. parainfluenzae_ is ornithine decarboxylase positive, whereas _H.
paraphrophilus_ is negative.

2Although their requirements for hemin and NAD factor differ from each other,
_H. aphrophilus_ and _H. paraphrophilus_ have recently been reclassified as a
single species with a new genus: _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus_ (3).

To differentiate between the two species, hemolysis must be checked on horse or rabbit blood agar by inoculating the cell suspension mentioned above on heart infusion agar with 5% rabbit blood (or agar infusion base containing horse blood). Alternatively, a _Haemophilus_ ID Quad plate can be used (see Section II.B. below).

Performing hemin and NAD growth factor requirement test using _Haemophilus_ ID Quad plates _Haemophilus_ ID Quad plates are another method for determining growth requirements of _Haemophilus_ isolates (Figure 6). While they are more expensive than the paper disks or strips, they can test for β-hemolysis (clear) on horse blood and assist in differentiating _H. haemolyticus_ from _H. influenzae_. The Quad plate is divided into four compartments. One quadrant includes medium containing hemin only (Figure 6, lower left). The second quadrant includes medium containing NAD only (Figure 6, upper left). The third quadrant contains medium that includes both hemin and NAD (Figure 6, upper right). The fourth quadrant contains heart infusion agar or blood agar base with 5% horse blood (Figure 6, lower right) for detecting hemolysis and differentiating _H. haemolyticus_ from _H. influenzae._ **Growth factor requirement procedure using _Haemophilus_ ID Quad plates**

Quality control of Quad plates

QC should be performed on each new lot of Quad plates before they are used for
unknown isolates to ensure that they will support the proper growth of
_Haemophilus_ spp. Three plates from each new lot received should be tested
using a well-characterized reference strain of _H. influenzae_ , _H.
haemolyticus_ , and _H. parahaemolyticus_. One uninoculated plate from each
new lot should also be tested in order to check for contamination of mold or
other organisms in the laboratory and/or incubator. QC should be repeated on
plates from a lot if they have been exposed to temperatures above 4°C or if
there is reason to suspect that the plates have been contaminated since the
initial QC was performed.

Identification of _H. influenzae_ serotype _Haemophilus influenzae_ can be encapsulated with one of six types of antigenically distinct capsules which can be serotyped using antisera to each capsule (serotypes a-f). _H. influenzae_ may also be non-encapsulated and such strains that cannot be serotyped are called _H. influenzae_ nontypeable (NT). Individual serotype-specific antisera for these major serotypes are available commercially. A polyvalent antiserum that recognizes all 6 serotypes is also available commercially.It is not always practical to test for all serotypes for which antisera are available in a laboratory. Testing algorithms may be set up in laboratories with previous knowledge of whether or not a H. influenzae serotype b (Hib) vaccination program has been implemented within that particular geographic region. Modifications may be made to the testing algorithm for any laboratory based on information regarding Hib vaccination status of the region. 

It is essential that reference laboratories have the capacity to isolate,
identify, and characterize the serotype of isolates of _H. influenzae_. This
valuable data provides laboratories and public health authorities with the
tools to identify outbreaks controllable by vaccination campaigns and
recognize serotypes causing sporadic disease.

SAST test algorithm for areas without an established Hib vaccination program

If a Hib vaccination program has not been implemented in the country or region
from which the isolate originated, it is likely that the _H. influenzae_
isolate is serotype b and the isolate should first be tested for reactivity to
serotype b antisera and a negative saline control. If the isolate reacts
positively with the serotype b antiserum with no agglutination in saline, the
isolate is identified as Hib. However, if the isolate is non-reactive with the
serotype b antiserum, and if polyvalent antiserum is available, it should be
tested with the polyvalent antiserum. If positive, the isolate should then be
tested with the remaining monovalent antisera (a, c, d, e, and f) to determine
the serotype. If negative for all monovalent antisera and positive for hemin
and NAD growth requirements, then the isolate is considered NT.

SAST test algorithm for areas with an established Hib vaccination program

If the isolate is from a country or region with an established Hib vaccination
program that has high Hib vaccine coverage, the isolate is likely to be NT or
a serotype other than b. In this case, the isolate should first be tested with
the polyvalent antiserum, if available, and a negative saline control. If
positive for the polyvalent antiserum with no agglutination in the saline, the
isolate should then be tested with the remaining monovalent antisera (a, b, c,
d, e, and f) to determine the serotype. If the isolate is negative for the
polyvalent antiserum and/or the monovalent antisera, and requires hemin and
NAD for growth, then the isolate is considered NT.

Slide agglutination serotyping (SAST) test for serotyping _H. influenzae_ isolatesFormalin-killed suspensions of _H. influenzae_ should be used for SAST testing rather than saline suspensions of living organisms to maintain a safe working environment. A solution of 5% formalinized physiological saline is sufficient to kill the bacteria. However, formalin is a carcinogen and must be stored and handled with great care. Alternatively, work should be performed under a biosafety hood if formalin is not used. Antisera should be stored in the refrigerator at 4°C and warmed to room temperature (25°C) before use. It must be put back in the refrigerator as soon as testing is finished to prevent the loss of binding activity of the antibody.

Gently tilt the slide to mix the cell suspensions with the antisera in each section. Continue to gently rock the slide for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the lower and upper portions to completely blend. Do not use a circular motion while rocking, as it can cause the sections with different serogroup-specific antisera to run together and contaminate each other.

Reading the SAST results

Rating the intensity of the agglutination reaction

Agglutination occurs when the antisera bind to the bacterial cells causing the
cells to agglutinate or clump together, thus making the cell suspension appear
clearer. The intensity of the agglutination reaction may vary according to the
density of the cell suspension or the antisera used. A description on the
intensity ratings shown in Figure 7 are listed below.

4+ All of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension appears clear  
3+ 75% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
2+ 50% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
1+ 25% of the cells agglutinate and the cell suspension remains slightly
cloudy  
+/- Less than 25% of the cells agglutinate and a fine granular matter occurs  
0 No visible agglutination; the suspension remains cloudy and smooth

If the original plate contains different size colonies, make a subculture for each type of colony and test both cultures the next day. The larger colonies usually indicate better capsule production and therefore better reactivity. However, the smaller colonies will occasionally give a better result.

Commercial identification kitsSeveral commercial identification systems that use biochemical or enzymatic substrates are available for identification of _Haemophilus_ spp. These systems may occasionally require supplemental tests, and additional characteristics, such as microscopic and colony morphology, must be considered. Generally, each system is self-contained, but the addition of one or more reagents to complete certain reactions may be necessary. The manufacturer's instructions should be followed precisely when using these kits. Some of the commercial identification kits also include biotyping of _H. influenzae_. For detailed instructions and use of appropriate control strains, consult the Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook (1).
