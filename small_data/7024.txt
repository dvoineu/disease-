### _**Updated Tables, January 2019**_

This  _Updated Tables, January 2019_ , presents nationally representative and
cumulative biomonitoring data gathered from 1999-2000 through 2015-2016. It
also includes all the data from each previous  _National Report on Human
Exposure to Environmental Chemicals_  and each of the previous  _Updated
Tables_.  The  _Updated Tables_  are represented in two separate volumes:
**Volume One** contains data tables for chemicals measured in the general U.S.
population;  **Volume Two**  contains data tables for persistent organic
pollutants and pesticides measured in pooled samples and adult cigarette
smokers and nonsmokers. For additional details, see the Introduction section
of the  _Updated Tables, Volume One, January 2019_.

Important Notice

On November 1, 2019, the NHANES 2007-2008 pooled data results for Dioxin,
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and organochlorine pesticide metabolites found
in Volume 2 were updated to address discrepancies found in some age group,
ethnicity, and gender categories. The discrepancies were limited to these
pooled data results and might have been due to the weight variable used at the
time of the original calculations.

The _Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals,
2009_ , (the _Fourth Report, 2009_ ) presents data for 212 chemicals. The
_Fourth Report_ includes the findings from nationally representative samples
for 1999-2004.

The blood and urine samples reported in both publications were collected from
participants in CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), which obtains and releases health-related data from a nationally
representative sample in two year cycles.
