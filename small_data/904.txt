Reducing MRSA infections is a CDC priority. CDC and U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services are working with healthcare facilities to meet the goals in
the 2013 National Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated
InfectionsExternal and reduce bloodstream infections caused by MRSA by 50% by
2020 using the 2015 baseline.

To protect people from MRSA, CDC works to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * prevent spread of the germ; and

Tracking MRSA

CDC scientists track the number and kind of MRSA infections throughout the
country using complementary systems. Together, these systems give CDC, other
Federal agencies such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),
health departments, and healthcare facilities information to better understand
where MRSA infections are happening, the types (strains) of staph bacteria
that are causing these, and where to put resources to help stop infections.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Reports  
Information sent from healthcare facilities to NHSN allows CDC to determine
how healthcare facilities overall are performing against national infection
prevention goals. It also allows CDC, health departments and facilities the
ability to identify, report, and help specific facilities and units with high
infection rates.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Emerging Infections Program (EIP)  
Using information from several locations throughout the country, CDC estimates
the national burden of MRSA and can identify people most at risk. This system
includes MRSA infections that happen in both the communities and in healthcare
facilities. CDC has previously reported on declines in invasive MRSA incidence
and other reports have suggested that during this time US MRSA strain
epidemiology has changed. The CDC Emerging Infections Program looked at
invasive MRSA bloodstream infection trends by strain type and healthcare
exposure in a subset of their surveillance region. They found that most of the
decline in MRSA bloodstream infections was from decreases in strains that
traditionally have been closely associated with healthcare exposure risk,
whereas outside of the hospital no change was found in incidence of the
dominant strain that causes infections in the community, called USA300. The
authors concluded that methods to prevent MRSA bloodstream infections from the
USA300 strain will be needed to further reduce burden from MRSA bloodstream
infections.

CDC collaborates with EHR databases from more than 400 U.S. acute care
hospitals to describe infection trends and monitor progress.

MRSA Research

CDC supports activities to better understand how to detect, prevent, and
respond to MRSA and protect people from MRSA infections. Some of the CDC-
supported projects include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **REDUCE MRSA**  
CDC's Prevention Epicenters studied the use of decolonization with
chlorohexidine and mupirocin, which can be used to reduce the amount of MRSA
on patients carrying it, in intensive care units (ICUs) in 43 U.S. hospitals.
The study found that universal use in these ICUs reduced MRSA by 37%. The
study is continuing to investigate if other methods for decolonization can be
as effective.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **ABATE Study**  
CDC's Prevention Epicenters also studied the use of chlorohexidine in all
patients and chlorohexidine and mupirocin for patients known to have MRSA and
compared it with routine bathing. The chlorohexidine and chlorohexidine-and-
mupirocin combination reduced MRSA by at least 30%.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Project CLEAR**  
Another CDC Prevention Epicenter randomized controlled clinical trial
investigated infection rates in patients discharged from the hospital with
hygiene education versus patients discharged from the hospital with hygiene
education and serial decolonization over 6 months (an effort to reduce the
amount of MRSA a person carries). Patients who were educated and decolonized
had 30% fewer MRSA infections in the one year following discharge.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **The University of California Irvine**  
Patients sometimes carry MRSA without showing signs of it (colonization) and
may suffer infections from the strain later. This 2018 one-year study will
evaluate what percent of MRSA carriers being discharged from hospitals have a
community-associated strain. This study will also assess what percent of
patients carrying the community MRSA variant develop infection within a year
of discharge. Finally, this project will assess whether a repeated
decolonization treatment can reduce post-discharge infections due to this
strain.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Rush University Medical Center**  
In this 2018 one-year study, researchers will use whole genome sequencing
(WGS) to examine historical MRSA clinical isolates from the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System in Chicago, IL. The objective of this study is to use WGS
along with epidemiologic data to better understand the spread of MRSA between
healthcare and community settings, with an ultimate goal to identify potential
interventions that can prevent infections.

Spotlight on States

Through the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Solutions Initiative, CDC supports
every state, some large cities, and Puerto Rico to rapidly detect and prevent
spread of infections, like MRSA. With 2017 funding:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Kentucky** supported the investigation of an outbreak of MRSA joint infections in patients who received injections at an outpatient orthopedic clinic. Recommendations were made to address observed breaches in infection control and concerns with medication combinations, and no further cases were identified.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **New Mexico** responded to an increase in positive MRSA cultures in a NICU (a hospital unit that cares for newborns) by evaluating bed location and patient movement, testing isolates, providing comprehensive recommendations, launching an educational campaign, and conducting enhanced surveillance. Follow up showed no new cases.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Pennsylvania** collaborated with a local jurisdiction to respond to 9 cases of invasive MRSA related to injection-related infection control breaches in an outpatient clinic. Immediate remediation prevented further cases and led to improvements in infection control practices.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **South Carolina** effectively responded to five cases of _Staphyloccocus aureus_ in a NICU.
