Strategy: Make Behavioral Health Treatment Settings Tobacco-Free

![New York Implements Tobacco-Free Campus Policies - photo outside of a sign
that states no smoking beyond this point with an office building in the

implements-smoke-free-campus-medium.JPG)

In 2008, New York became the first state to require that all state-funded or
state-certified substance use disorder treatment programs (involving over
1,400 programs at the time) prohibit smoking on any property owned or operated
by those programs, including outdoor areas.1

The counselors and clinical supervisors reported that, at first, they had some
problems with implementing and enforcing the policy. However, policy
implementation improved over time.2, 3

![Smoke-free Policies in Behavioral Health Treatment Facilities, New York and
United States, 2016 - New York has 65.6% of mental health treatment facilities
with smoke-free policies compared to 48.6% for the U.S. overall.  New York has
83% of substance use disorder treatment facilities with smoke-free policies
compared to 34.5% for the U.S. overall.](/tobacco/disparities/promising-
policies-and-practices/images/new-york-graph-mobile-500x800.jpg)

About one year after the New York Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse
Services (OASAS) implemented this policy, counselors and clinical supervisors
noted that:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Fewer clients were smoking,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * More clients were aware of the harms related to smoking, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * More clients wanted to quit and knew about resources to help them quit.2

New York first addressed smoking at substance use disorder treatment
facilities because of OASAS's interest and readiness, given its knowledge of
the linkages between treating nicotine addiction and treating other
addictions. After OASAS implemented its policy, the Office of Mental Health
decided to take a similar--but not identical--approach to address the burden
of tobacco use on its clients. The Office of Mental Health partnered with the
State Department of Health Bureau of Tobacco Control to train mental health
providers and Department of Health grantees to help mental health facilities
adopt and implement tobacco-free campus policies. These policies prohibit the
use of all types of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, on the entire
campuses of mental health facilities, including outdoor areas.

Bureau staff report that the tobacco-free campus policies have resulted in
social norm change with respect to tobacco use, making it easier for
behavioral health providers to screen for tobacco use and help clients quit.
Tobacco-free campus policies can reinforce tobacco-free norms and also
eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke. To further support efforts by
behavioral health providers to address tobacco use, partner agencies in New
York created a cross-walk chart summarizing tobacco-related requirements from
several behavioral health regulatory agencies. The chart includes each
agency's regulations and recommendations on screening and treating clients
(including at discharge), training staff, and adopting tobacco-free campus
policies.4

These efforts have likely contributed to recent research findings showing that
New York is the state with the highest proportion of substance use disorder
treatment facilities that have smoke-free campuses, screen for tobacco use,
offer cessation counseling, and offer nicotine replacement therapy.5
