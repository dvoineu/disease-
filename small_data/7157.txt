Welcome to the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention (NCHHSTP).

Our mission is to save lives, protect people, and reduce health disparities
associated with HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),
and tuberculosis (TB).

Every year, millions of Americans are infected with HIV, viral hepatitis,
STDs, or TB. Tens of thousands die or experience debilitating complications
because of these infections. HIV, viral hepatitis, STDs, and TB often share
overlapping risk factors and disease interactions and disproportionately
affect racial and ethnic minorities, men who have sex with men, persons who
inject drugs, and other vulnerable populations.

EIS officers in NCHHSTP have the opportunity to do impactful work that saves
lives, protects people, and reduces health disparities by preventing and
controlling these infections domestically and internationally. Our center has
a rich tradition of providing exceptional supervision and training of EIS
officers and is known for its diversity of epidemiologic, clinical,
biological, psychosocial/behavioral, policy, and other public health
approaches.

With hundreds of scientists across our center and numerous partners in
communities, states, and nations around the world, NCHHSTP offers EIS officers
vast opportunities for collaboration. We invite you to explore the exciting
opportunities available in our divisions.
