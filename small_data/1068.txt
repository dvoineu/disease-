### Purpose

This document is designed to provide guidance to Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention employees and contractors on the process for planning and
development, as well as best practices for participating and engaging, on the
social networking site.

### Background

Facebookexternal icon is a social networking service launched in February
2004. As of March 2012, Facebook has more than 901 million active users, who
generate an average of 3.2 billion Likes and Comments per day.

The first CDC Facebook page, managed by the Office of the Associate Director
for Communication Science (OADC), Division of News and Electronic Media
(DNEM), Electronic Media Branch (EMB), was launched in May 2009 to share
featured health and safety updates and to build an active and participatory
community around the work of the agency. The agency has expanded its Facebook
presence beyond the main CDC profile, and now supports multiple Facebook
profiles connecting users with information on a range of CDC health and safety
topics.

### Communications Strategy

Facebook, as with other social media tools, is intended to be part of a larger
integrated health communications strategy or campaign developed under the
leadership of the Associate Director of Communication Science (ADCS) in the
Health Communication Science Office (HCSO) of CDC's National Centers,
Institutes, and Offices (CIOs).

### Clearance and Approval

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Posting standard health messages (e.g., exercise is good for you) should also go through a program's communications clearance channels.

It is recommended that CDC Facebook pages include CDC in the page name and the
CDC logo. Co-branding and the use of additional logos may also be incorporated
in accordance with CDC Brand Identity standards.

### Comment Policy

An official comment policy should be developed for each Facebook page. An
example CDC Facebook page comment policy is available in the application
section of the CDC Facebook page.

### Records Management

All Facebook page administrators must establish a system to collect all
Facebook posts, comments, fan posts, events, and hidden posts (spam) to comply
with Federal guidelines for records management and archiving.

Any comment removed for violating the CDC commenting policy must be recorded
and archived prior to deleting.

### Consultation

The Digital Media Branch (DMB) provides consultation on the planning and
development of Facebook activities and other social media tools. Your CIO's
Social Media Council representative can also provide assistance.

### Planning Recommendations

Before using Facebook, programs should consider the following recommendations
when developing communication plans:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Clearly Define the Objectives: It is important to have clearly defined objectives before  
participating in Facebook. Do you want to highlight content, spark action, or
encourage  
awareness of an issue? Clearly defined objectives will help you to determine
if Facebook  
can help you in meeting larger communication goals.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Know Your Target Audience(s): As with any communications activity, it is important to define your intended target audience(s) in order to develop and communicate messages that resonate with your audience and prompt them to take action.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Determine Resource Needs: Determine if you have the appropriate staffing resources to  
create content and manage a Facebook page. It is important to designate a
channel  
manager to serve as the point of contact for Facebook activities and ensure
the content is  
posted on a regular basis.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Identify the Best Platform: Determine if you should develop a new Facebook page, have  
content posted on the CDC Facebook page, or use a different social media
channel. See  
Appendix A, Channel Decision Matrix, for additional guidance

### Best Practices

Programs should consider the following best practices when developing Facebook
content and activities:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Keep Your Content Short and Simple: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Length of posts should be 250 characters or less to allow the post to be viewed in its entirety in the news feed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Length of comments should be 1,000 characters or less, and include a CDC.gov link for additional information and resources.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Determine Schedule and Frequency of Facebook Posts: It is important to set a posting schedule that defines a regular frequency for posts per week. Setting a regular schedule helps to ensure that the account is active and encourages more engaged users. Consider posting daily at a minimum.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Identify the Best Web Link: All Facebook posts should include a single URL, preferably to  
the CDC website or other CDC multimedia, to direct the user for more
information.  
Campaign codes can be added to CDC.gov links in order to track metrics in
Adobe Site  
Catalyst.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Add Custom Images: When posting CDC.gov Web links on Facebook, it is important that web pages are properly coded for enhanced display on Facebook. Please see Appendix B, Adding Custom Images for Facebook Posts, for additional guidance.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. Conduct Promotion Activities: Ongoing promotion of your Facebook page is strongly  
recommended. Example promotion activities include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Cross-promote on other CDC social media channels. Ask page owners of existing CDC Facebook pages and Twitter profiles with similar audiences and/or content to promote your Facebook activities.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Post links to your Facebook page on your website.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Send content-specific GovDelivery email updates.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Send emails to partners and grantees.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Determine Approach for Engaging with Facebook Fans: Facebook should be used to  
engage your target audience in two-way interaction and communication. Examples
of  
engagement activities include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Develop criteria for whom to Like and Tag on Facebook and share relevant partner content. See Appendix C, Best Practices for Liking and Commenting as the CDC Brand, for additional guidance.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Post content that is actionable, such as Facebook chats, events, quizzes, contests/challenges, questions, videos, infographics, photos, badges, widgets and interactive posts and comments on trending health topics to encourage followers to participate in conversations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Asks users to do something within the post or content such as Share, Like, or Comment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Highlight posts that encourage CDC priorities and information sharing by pinning, highlighting or adding as a milestone on the Timeline.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Post content that cross promotes other social media channels (e.g. Twitter, YouTube, Flickr)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Post additional information rather than remove comments that are inaccurate or not reflective of CDC science. Removal of comments that are inaccurate or opinionated, but not in violation of the comment policy, may cause a lack of trust in the site and has proven to be a practice that encourages backlash by the community.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Monitor your Facebook page to respond as soon as possible to fan questions, comments and other feedback.

### Evaluation

Evaluation is an integral component for measuring the success of all social
media activities, including Facebook. Regularly review Facebook Insights for
page-specific metrics. You may also consider monitoring the increases in
traffic to your website, as well as the mentions outside of Facebook on blogs,
websites or articles. Adobe SiteCatalyst can be used to determine the number
of click-throughs from a post with a link to a CDC.gov website. Automatically
delivered metrics reports can be set-up for programs upon request. For more
information, please visit the Statistics and Metrics intranet site.

### Highlighting Content on CDC's Main Facebook Page

The Digital Media Branch maintains the CDC Facebook Page, and welcomes
programs to use it to highlight their content. Content is posted on the
existing page 2-4 times per day on a variety of health and safety topics, and
is moderated daily by EMB staff in accordance with the CDC comment policy.

Requests to post on the main CDC Facebook page should be sent to
socialmedia@cdc.gov one week in advance; however reasonable exceptions will be
made in case of emergency. Submitted content must be cleared through a
program's established communications clearance channels. If the topic is
potentially controversial, identify a subject matter expert or communication
specialist to help monitor Facebook comments on the day of posting. It is also
recommended you draft and clear in advance possible responses and posts to
additional informational for controversial topics.

Posts should be 250 characters or less and include a single URL (e.g.,
CDC.gov, partner, government agency, etc.) photo, or video when possible.
Metadata for CDC.gov URLs should be included so that links and images properly
display within Facebook.

### Creating a New CDC Facebook Page

Please submit a Create-IT request to schedule a consultation with EMB or
contact your Social Media Council representative for assistance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Develop and Clear a Facebook Concept, Plan, and Content: All Facebook activities, including account set-up and content creation, must be cleared through your CIO's established communications clearance channels.

It is recommended that the profile name and page URL include CDC (e.g., CDC Emergency Preparedness and Response, CDC Health Partners Outreach).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * List of page administrators: One to two individuals who will serve as page administrators and have the authority to post on behalf of the page (topic).

It is recommended that the launch plan include a soft, internal-only launch to
build your fan base to 25. Once a page has 25 fans, you can claim your custom
page URL and begin a larger promotion effort
(https://www.facebook.com/username/).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Facebook ads must be removed from the page prior to external launch, as negotiated under the federal Terms of Service. Please send your request for ad removal to socialmedia@cdc.gov.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4.
