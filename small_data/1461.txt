### Indiana Uses Science to Reduce Exposure to Secondhand Smoke

The Indiana State Department of Health's tobacco control program has worked
hard to reduce tobacco product use and secondhand smoke exposure among Indiana
citizens. Like the tulip tree--the official state tree of Indiana--the tobacco
control program has deep roots. The program's team of 10 staff members has
more than 80 combined years of tobacco control experience and are committed to
using science and following best practices to improve the health of Indiana
residents, also known as "Hoosiers." This work has led to fewer Hoosiers using
tobacco products and resulted in local, comprehensive smoke-free policies
covering nearly 1 in 3 Indiana residents. Despite the best efforts of the
tobacco control program, a majority of Hoosiers live in communities without
comprehensive smoke-free policies and still are exposed to secondhand smoke in
public places and their workplaces.1 Also, 1 in 4 Indiana middle and high
school students still are exposed to secondhand smoke at home.2

action/indiana/images/man-in-field.jpg)

### Changing What Hoosiers Think About Tobacco Products

Secondhand smoke causes more than 1,300 deaths in Indiana each year. It also
costs the state $2.1 billion in medical expenses and premature death each
year.3 The tobacco control program staff discovered a major barrier to
reducing secondhand smoke exposure in Indiana: many Hoosiers believed smoking
was routine or acceptable. They did not fully understand the harms of tobacco
use and they did not know that no level of exposure to secondhand smoke is
safe.

The tobacco control program and its partners looked at ways to change how
Hoosiers think about tobacco products and at how to educate them about the
health and financial benefits of reducing tobacco use in Indiana.

### The Importance of Partnerships

Together, the partners recognized that a number of different approaches could
help change residents' attitudes and behavior, and protect people from
dangerous secondhand smoke in Indiana. These included:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Giving resources to communities and businesses wanting to protect their residents, employees, and customers from secondhand smoke.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Helping tobacco users quit using tobacco products.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Preventing young people in Indiana from ever starting to use tobacco products.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Working more closely with groups of people who are at higher risk of using tobacco products than the general population.

### Giving Hoosiers the Facts

The tobacco control program prepared fact sheets about each county to help
people better understand how secondhand smoke affects their communities. The
fact sheets provide scientific evidence and county-specific data, including:
the percentage of adults in the county who smoke; the number of deaths in the
county caused by tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure; total cost to the
county due to the effects of secondhand smoke; and any smoke-free laws or
voluntary smoke-free policies that are in place in the county.4

So far, 22 cities and counties in Indiana have adopted comprehensive smoke-
free policies, meaning 31% of all Hoosiers are now protected from secondhand
smoke.5 The program and its partners also helped these communities with their
communication strategies, which made it easier for communities to implement
their policies.

Partnering with Counter Toolsexternal icon, the tobacco control program
trained community organizations and organizations who serve minority groups to
study tobacco product availability and advertising inside stores where tobacco
products are sold. The tobacco industry spends nearly $297 million per year
marketing its products in Indiana, and spends most of that money on in-store
marketing.1 This marketing makes it more likely that children and teens will
start using tobacco products. The industry also targets communities that have
higher proportions of tobacco use.6

### Fewer Smokers Means Less Secondhand Smoke

People are not exposed to as much secondhand smoke when more people quit
smoking. Indiana already has a tobacco Quitlineexternal icon, but the tobacco
control program added new resources to support people with mental health or
substance use disorders in trying to quit. The program also wanted to help
employers support employees who want to quit through worksite wellness
programs. It developed resources for local partners to educate nearly 1,500
Indiana employers who enrolled in a program to learn more. The business owners
learned about the health benefits of referring employees to the Quitline,
paying for other services to help employees quit using tobacco products, and
adopting smoke-free policies to support employees who are trying to quit.

CDC's funding of Indiana's tobacco control program staff and its educational
and cessation activities has been an important part of Indiana's success in
putting CDC-recommended tobacco control strategies into practice. Hoosiers now
better understand the issues related to tobacco use and secondhand smoke
exposure. This has changed their attitudes about the acceptability of tobacco
use, prompted their communities to protect their citizens from secondhand
smoke, and reduced the harms caused by tobacco use.
