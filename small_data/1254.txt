The _Flaviviridae_ are a family of positive, single-stranded, enveloped RNA
viruses. They are found in arthropods, (primarily ticks and mosquitoes), and
can occasionally infect humans.

Members of this family belong to a single genus, _Flavivirus_ , and cause
widespread morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Some of the
mosquitoes-transmitted viruses include: Yellow Fever, Dengue Fever, Japanese
encephalitis, West Nile viruses, and Zika virus. Other _Flaviviruses_ are
transmitted by ticks and are responsible of encephalitis and hemorrhagic
diseases: Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE), Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) and
Alkhurma disease, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever.
