amphibian. Reptiles include turtles, lizards, and snakes, and amphibians
include frogs, salamanders, and caecilians.

Reptile and amphibian owners should be aware that their pets can carry germs
that make people sick.  One important germ is _Salmonella_ _. Salmonella_ is
normally in the digestive tract of healthy reptiles and amphibians, but it can
cause infections in people who have contact with reptiles, amphibians, and
their environments, including the water from terrariums or aquariums where
they live.

If you decide that a reptile or amphibian is the right pet for you, it is very
important that you learn how to properly take care of it and become aware of
diseases that it might carry. With routine veterinary care and some simple
habits, you can reduce your risk of getting sick from touching, petting, or
owning a reptile or amphibian.

**_Salmonella_ is the most common disease associated with reptiles and
amphibians that can cause human illness. See information about _Salmonella_
and other diseases linked to reptiles and amphibians below.**

_Aeromonas_ is a type of bacteria that is commonly found in fresh water ponds
and aquariums. This germ can cause disease in fish and amphibians. _Aeromonas_
can cause discoloration of the limbs of amphibians and fins of fish. It can
also cause internal bleeding in these aquatic animals.

People can become infected through open wounds or by drinking contaminated
water. Young children and adults with weak immune systems are most commonly
affected and may have diarrhea or blood infections.

Maintaining good water quality in aquariums, promptly removing dead fish, and
practicing healthy habits, including hand washing, will reduce the risk of
_Aeromonas_ infection.

_Mycobacterium marinum_ spreads to fish, reptiles, and people through
contaminated water or contact with infected animals. Infected animals may not
show any signs of disease. Some affected animals develop open sores on their
skin or have deformed bones.

People can become infected with _Mycobacterium marinum_ by having direct
contact with infected animals or contaminated water (for example, contaminated
ponds or aquariums). The most common sign of infection is development of a
skin infection.  In very rare cases, the bacteria can spread throughout the
body systems.  Infections progress slowly and may get better on their own. In
some instances, antibiotics and surgical wound treatments are required to
prevent deep infection.

Salmonellosis ( _Salmonella_ spp.)

_Salmonella_ spreads to people and animals through contaminated food or
contact with the stools of certain animals, including reptiles and amphibians.
An animal's aquarium or terrarium may also be a source of _Salmonella.
Salmonella_ can be found in healthy reptiles and amphibians and doesn't
usually make them sick.

People exposed to _Salmonella_ may have diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or
abdominal cramps. Infants, elderly persons, and people with weakened immune
systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness.

### Healthy habits

**Healthy reptiles and amphibians can carry _Salmonella_ and other germs that
can make people sick. But there's good news! You can keep yourself healthy
around your pet reptiles and amphibians.**

![person washing their hands](/healthypets/images/wash-hands.jpg)

Reptiles and amphibians can carry germs that can make people sick, even when
they appear healthy and clean. Always wash your hands thoroughly after
handling reptiles and amphibians, and anything in the area where they live or
roam such as their habitats, food, or equipment. Be sure to help children wash
their hands properly. If soap and water are not readily available, use hand
sanitizer immediately and wash hands thoroughly as soon as possible.
Thoroughly washing your hands will help reduce your risk of getting sick from
a disease spread to you by your pets.

You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from their germs. Be aware that any reptile food such as frozen or live rodents, equipment, and materials, including the tank water, can be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and other germs.

Never use food-preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or anything in their habitats. These items should be cleaned outside of your home. If you clean the habitat in the bathroom, thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right afterwards.

Don't kiss or bring reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this may frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten.

#### Before choosing a pet reptile or amphibian

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Reptiles and amphibians might not be right for your family because of their risk for spreading germs to people. This is particularly true if you have children under 5 years of age, adults over 65 years of age, or people with weak immune systems living in your household. People with weak immune systems may include people with an illness such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS, or those undergoing chemotherapy.

Did you know that the sale of turtles less than 4 inches has been banned in
the United States since 1975? This is because small turtles pose a higher risk
of spreading disease, especially to children. The ban by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has prevented an estimated 100,000 cases of
_Salmonella_ each year in children.

If you buy a pet turtle, only buy one with a shell longer than 4 inches from a
trusted pet store.

This isn't good for the animal or for the environment. Most reptiles and amphibians released outdoors will die, and some grow to become a threat to natural wildlife populations.

#### Bites and scratches from reptiles and amphibians

![A snake is about to bite the handler](/healthypets/images/snake-poison.jpg)

Not all reptiles have teeth, although bites from the ones that do can be very
dangerous, some even venomous (venoms are poisons made by some animals).
Reptiles without teeth, like most turtles, are still capable of painful bites.
Don't kiss or bring reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this may
frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten.

Bites from animals with teeth can be very dangerous because they can spread
germs and other toxic substances from the mouth of the animal to the wound.
See more information about how to respond to snake bites.

#### Reptile and amphibian venoms ** **

CDC does not recommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household
settings.

Venoms are a defense that reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves
from any potential dangers or harm in their environment.

Venomous animals can sometimes be easily identified by their bright
colorations and markings, such as the poison dart frog and coral snake,
although not all venomous animals are so easy to identify. Animals can
transmit venoms through bites or through contact with their skin or saliva.
For example, poison dart frogs are beautiful animals that excrete deadly
toxins through their skin. It has been reported that one frog can produce
enough toxin to kill 10 adults.

There are many different types of venomous reptiles and amphibians throughout
the world. In the United States, there are only four native types of venomous
snakes (coral snakes, rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads) and one
venomous lizard (the Gila monster), though non-native animals have found their
way into the United States through the pet trade.

You should always consider the unpredictable nature of venomous animals and be
aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is difficult. Venoms are
very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. Vials of anti-
venom, used to treat some bites, can cost hundreds of dollars and may not be
available at community hospitals.

If you choose to keep or work with venomous animals, you should make a list of
all the hospitals in your area that stock anti-venom for the types of animals
you will be around. Put a list of those hospital phone numbers and addresses
somewhere easily found, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's
habitat.
