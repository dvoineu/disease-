Tobacco use, including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars, varies by
geographic region within the United States. People living in certain regions
and communities often suffer more from poor health because of tobacco use,
especially cigarette smoking.1

By U.S. Census region, prevalence of cigarette smoking among U.S. adults is
highest among people living in the Midwest (22.2%) and the South (22.7%), and
lowest among those living in the Northeast (20.1%) and West (16.3%) regions.2
People in the Midwest and South also tend to use multiple types of tobacco
products, such as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.1

By county population types, prevalence of cigarette smoking among U.S. adults
is highest among those living in rural areas (28.5%) and urban areas (25.1%),
and lowest among those living in small metropolitan areas (22.0%) and large
metropolitan areas (18.3%).2

The health of people living in rural areas is impacted by tobacco use more so
than those in urban and metropolitan areas, often because of socioeconomic
factors, culture, policies, and lack of proper healthcare.3 For more
information about rural related health disparities visit: Advancing Tobacco
Prevention and Control in Rural America pdf icon[PDF-3.76 MB]external icon.

In general, rates of death attributable to smoking are lower in states with
lower prevalence of smoking.1

### Tobacco Use Prevalence

The following charts show current tobacco use among U.S. adults aged 18 years
and older by four major geographic regions--Midwest, South, Northeast, and
West and by county population type--large metropolitan, smaller metropolitan,
urban, and rural. Information within these charts was collected in the 2016
National Survey on Drug Use and Health and includes persons reporting
cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar use within the 30 days before the
survey was taken.2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The proportion of current cigarette smokers who report intermittent (nondaily) smoking is highest among cigarette smokers living in the West (43.1%) and lowest among those living in the Midwest (31.7%).1
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Smokers living in rural areas are more likely to smoke 15 or more cigarettes per day than smokers living in urban areas.1
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Adolescents in rural regions begin smoking cigarettes earlier in life, and daily smoking is more likely among adolescents in rural areas than adolescents in suburban and urban areas.3

### Health Effects

#### Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop heart disease, stroke,
lung cancer, and other lung diseases.1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The highest rates of death attributable to smoking occur in the southern states of Kentucky and West Virginia.1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Local smokefree laws vary significantly by geographic region and by the different communities within them. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * In some states, communities having residents with less education and lower incomes are less likely to be covered by comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in all areas of workplaces, restaurants, and bars.10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * In some states, urban areas and areas with high per-capita income are more likely to have strong smokefree laws.10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Residents of rural areas are more likely to allow smoking in the presence of children in their homes and cars.3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The percentage of children in small rural areas who live in a household with a smoker (35.0%) is greater than the percentage of children in urban areas who live with a smoker (24.4%).3

In some states without statewide comprehensive smoke-free laws, substantial
progress has been made in adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws at the local
level.11

### Quitting Behavior

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The percentage of people who quit smoking is higher among those living in the Northeast than any other region.2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Smokers who live in rural areas are less likely to have access to programs that help them quit smoking.3

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Influence

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The tobacco industry has historically targeted young rural men by presenting advertisements with rugged images as cowboys, hunters, and race car drivers.3,13
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Youth in rural areas are less likely to be exposed to anti-tobacco messages in the media.3,13
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Low income and predominantly minority neighborhoods often have more tobacco retailers and more tobacco advertising than other neighborhoods.14,15
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People who see tobacco promotions in places where tobacco is sold are more likely to smoke.16
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * African American communities have a high number of exterior and interior point-of-sale advertising for tobacco products.17

**Strategies that restrict advertising, limit the number of retailers in
neighborhoods, and prohibit price discounting can help reduce tobacco use and
its negative health outcomes. 14**

**Efforts to promote implementation of statewide and local comprehensive
smoke-free laws are critical to protect nonsmokers from preventable health
hazards in the places they live, work, and gather. 11**

**Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass
media campaigns like** **CDC 's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco
education campaign** **, as well as** **CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and
control programs and policies** **, can help reduce geographic disparities in
tobacco use and exposure.**
