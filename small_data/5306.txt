### Situation Update

![Map of flu activity in the
U.S.](/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2009-2010/images/h1n1usmap20_small_165x90.jpg)The
U.S. Public Health Emergency for 2009 H1N1 Influenza expired on June 23, 2010.
On August 10, 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health
Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee declared an end to the 2009 H1N1
pandemic globally. For information about CDCâs response to the 2009 H1N1
pandemic, visit The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Summary Highlights, April 2009-April
2010. Â Internationally, 2009 H1N1 viruses and seasonal influenza viruses are
co-circulating in many parts of the world.Â It is likely that the 2009 H1N1
virus will continue to spread for years to come, like a regular seasonal
influenza virus.

### Vaccination

CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccination as the first and most important step
in protecting against the flu. The U.S. 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine
will protect against an H3N2 virus, an influenza B virus, and the 2009 H1N1
virus that emerged last year to cause the first global pandemic in more than
40 years and resulted in substantial illness, hospitalizations and deaths.
Seasonal 2010-11 vaccine has begun shipping from manufacturers and CDC
recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a 2010-2011 flu vaccine for
the upcoming season as vaccine is available.Â
