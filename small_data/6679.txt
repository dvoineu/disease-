Genital herpes is a chronic, life-long viral infection. Two types of HSV can
cause genital herpes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes
are caused by HSV-2, and approximately 50 million persons in the United States
are infected with this type of genital herpes _(318)_. However, an increasing
proportion of anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to HSV-1
infection, which is especially prominent among young women and MSM
_(319-321)_.

Most persons infected with HSV-2 have not had the condition diagnosed. Many
such persons have mild or unrecognized infections but shed virus
intermittently in the anogenital area. As a result, most genital herpes
infections are transmitted by persons unaware that they have the infection or
who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs. Management of genital HSV
should address the chronic nature of the disease rather than focusing solely
on treatment of acute episodes of genital lesions.

###  Diagnostic Considerations

The clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult, because the painful
multiple vesicular or ulcerative lesions typically associated with HSV are
absent in many infected persons. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much
more frequent for genital HSV-2 infection than for genital HSV-1 infection
_(322,323)_. A patient's prognosis and the type of counseling needed depend on
the type of genital herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2) causing the infection; therefore,
the clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific
laboratory testing _(321,324)_. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific
serologic tests for HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide
care to persons with or at risk for STDs. Persons with genital herpes should
be tested for HIV infection.

###  Virologic Tests

Cell culture and PCR are the preferred HSV tests for persons who seek medical
treatment for genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous lesions. The sensitivity
of viral culture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and declines
rapidly as lesions begin to heal. Nucleic acid amplification methods,
including PCR assays for HSV DNA, are more sensitive and are increasingly
available _(325-327)_. PCR is the test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections
affecting the central nervous system and systemic infections (e.g.,
meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). Viral culture isolates and PCR
amplicons should be typed to determine which type of HSV is causing the
infection. Failure to detect HSV by culture or PCR, especially in the absence
of active lesions, does not indicate an absence of HSV infection because viral
shedding is intermittent. Cytologic detection of cellular changes associated
with HSV infection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing
genital lesions (i.e., Tzanck preparation) and therefore should not be relied
on. Although a direct immunofluorescence (IF) assay using fluorescein-labeled
monoclonal antibodies is also available to detect HSV antigen from genital
specimens, this assay lacks sensitivity _(328)_.

###  Type-Specific Serologic Tests

Both type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV develop during the first
several weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. Accurate type-specific
HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G2 (HSV-2) and
glycoprotein G1 (HSV-1). Providers should only request type-specific
glycoprotein G (gG)-based serologic assays when serology is performed for
their patients _(329-331)_.

Both laboratory-based assays and point-of-care tests that provide results for
HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum during a clinic visit are
available. The sensitivities of these glycoprotein G type-specific tests for
the detection of HSV-2 antibody vary from 80%-98%; false-negative results
might be more frequent at early stages of infection _(330,332,333)_. The most
commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 Elisa might be falsely positive at low
index values (1.1-3.5) _(334-336)_. Such low values should be confirmed with
another test, such as Biokit or the Western blot _(337)_. The HerpeSelect
HSV-2 Immunoblot should not be used for confirmation, because it uses the same
antigen as the HSV-2 Elisa. Repeat testing is indicated if recent acquisition
of genital herpes is suspected. The HerpeSelect HSV-1 Elisa is insensitive for
detection of HSV-1 antibody. IgM testing for HSV 1 or HSV-2 is not useful,
because IgM tests are not type-specific and might be positive during recurrent
genital or oral episodes of herpes _(337)_.

Because nearly all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, the presence of
type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance,
education and counseling appropriate for persons with genital HSV infections
should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to
interpret. Many persons with HSV-1 antibody have oral HSV infection acquired
during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. However, acquisition of genital
HSV-1 is increasing, and genital HSV-1 also can be asymptomatic
_(318-321,338)_. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does
not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and
regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring
HSV-2.

Type-specific HSV serologic assays might be useful in the following scenarios:
1) recurrent genital symptoms or atypical symptoms with negative HSV PCR or
culture; 2) clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory
confirmation; and 3) a patient whose partner has genital herpes. HSV serologic
testing should be considered for persons presenting for an STD evaluation
(especially for those persons with multiple sex partners), persons with HIV
infection, and MSM at increased risk for HIV acquisition. Screening for HSV-1
and HSV-2 in the general population is not indicated.

###  Management of Genital Herpes

Antiviral chemotherapy offers clinical benefits to most symptomatic patients
and is the mainstay of management. Counseling regarding the natural history of
genital herpes, sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods to reduce
transmission is integral to clinical management.

Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms of
genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes or
when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither eradicate
latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after
the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three
antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for genital herpes: acyclovir,
valacyclovir, and famciclovir _(339-347)_. Valacyclovir is the valine ester of
acyclovir and has enhanced absorption after oral administration. Famciclovir
also has high oral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs
offers minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.

###  First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes

Newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged clinical illness with
severe genital ulcerations and neurologic involvement. Even persons with
first-episode herpes who have mild clinical manifestations initially can
develop severe or prolonged symptoms. Therefore, all patients with first
episodes of genital herpes should receive antiviral therapy.

###  Established HSV-2 Infection

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode genital HSV-2 infection
subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions; recurrences are
less frequent after initial genital HSV-1 infection. Intermittent asymptomatic
shedding occurs in persons with genital HSV-2 infection, even in those with
longstanding or clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent
genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the
frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration
of lesions. Some persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent
outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment
should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the
additional advantage of decreasing the risk for genital HSV-2 transmission to
susceptible partners _(348,349)_.

#### Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent Genital Herpes

Suppressive therapy reduces the frequency of genital herpes recurrences by
70%-80% in patients who have frequent recurrences _(345-348)_ ; many persons
receiving such therapy report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks.
Treatment also is effective in patients with less frequent recurrences. Safety
and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily therapy with
acyclovir for as long as 6 years and with valacyclovir or famciclovir for 1
year _(350,351)_. Quality of life is improved in many patients with frequent
recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment
_(352)_.

The frequency of genital herpes recurrences diminishes over time in many
persons, potentially resulting in psychological adjustment to the disease.
Therefore, periodically during suppressive treatment (e.g., once a year),
providers should discuss the need to continue therapy. However, neither
treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring in a healthy person is
necessary.

Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2
transmission in discordant, heterosexual couples in which the source partner
has a history of genital HSV-2 infection _(349)_. Such couples should be
encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy to
prevent transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of
sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy also is
likely to reduce transmission when used by persons who have multiple partners
(including MSM) and by those who are HSV-2 seropositive without a history of
genital herpes.

*Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens in persons who have very frequent recurrences (i.e., ≥10 episodes per year).

Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir appear equally effective for episodic
treatment of genital herpes _(342-346)_ , but famciclovir appears somewhat
less effective for suppression of viral shedding _(353)_. Ease of
administration and cost also are important considerations for prolonged
treatment.

#### Episodic Therapy for Recurrent Genital Herpes

Effective episodic treatment of recurrent herpes requires initiation of
therapy within 1 day of lesion onset or during the prodrome that precedes some
outbreaks. The patient should be provided with a supply of drug or a
prescription for the medication with instructions to initiate treatment
immediately when symptoms begin.

###  Severe Disease

Intravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy should be provided for patients who have
severe HSV disease or complications that necessitate hospitalization (e.g.,
disseminated infection, pneumonitis, or hepatitis) or CNS complications (e.g.,
meningoencephalitis). The recommended regimen is acyclovir 5-10 mg/kg IV every
8 hours for 2-7 days or until clinical improvement is observed, followed by
oral antiviral therapy to complete at least 10 days of total therapy. HSV
encephalitis requires 21 days of intravenous therapy. Impaired renal function
warrants an adjustment in acyclovir dosage.

###  Counseling

Counseling of infected persons and their sex partners is critical to the
management of genital herpes. The goals of counseling include helping patients
cope with the infection and preventing sexual and perinatal transmission.
Although initial counseling can be provided at the first visit, many patients
benefit from learning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute
illness subsides. Multiple resources, including websites
(http://www.ashasexualhealth.orgExternal) and printed materials, are available
to assist patients, their partners, and clinicians who become involved in
counseling _(354,355)_.

Although the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of HSV-2 infection
in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized genital herpes appears minimal
and transient _(356,357)_ , some HSV-infected persons might express anxiety
concerning genital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity
of their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can be
substantial. Common concerns regarding genital herpes include the severity of
initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, sexual relationships and
transmission to sex partners, and ability to bear healthy children. The
misconception that HSV causes cancer should be dispelled.

The following topics should be discussed when counseling persons with genital

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 infection by type-
specific serologic testing should receive the same counseling messages as
persons with symptomatic infection. In addition, such persons should be
educated about the clinical manifestations of genital herpes.

Pregnant women and women of childbearing age who have genital herpes should
inform the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will
care for their newborn infant about their infection. More detailed counseling
messages are described in Special Considerations, Genital Herpes in Pregnancy.

###  Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have genital herpes can benefit from
evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and
treated in the same manner as patients who have genital herpes. Asymptomatic
sex partners of patients who have genital herpes should be questioned
concerning histories of genital lesions and offered type-specific serologic
testing for HSV infection.

###  Special Considerations

#### Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Allergic and other adverse reactions to oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and
famciclovir are rare. Desensitization to acyclovir has been described _(360)_.

#### HIV Infection

Immunocompromised patients can have prolonged or severe episodes of genital,
perianal, or oral herpes. Lesions caused by HSV are common among persons with
HIV infection and might be severe, painful, and atypical. HSV shedding is
increased in persons with HIV infection. Whereas antiretroviral therapy
reduces the severity and frequency of symptomatic genital herpes, frequent
subclinical shedding still occurs _(361,362)_. Clinical manifestations of
genital herpes might worsen during immune reconstitution early after
initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

Suppressive or episodic therapy with oral antiviral agents is effective in
decreasing the clinical manifestations of HSV among persons with HIV infection
_(363-365)_. HSV type-specific serologic testing can be offered to persons
with HIV infection during their initial evaluation if infection status is
unknown, and suppressive antiviral therapy can be considered in those who have
HSV-2 infection. Suppressive anti-HSV therapy in persons with HIV infection
does not reduce the risk for either HIV transmission or HSV-2 transmission to
susceptible sex partners _(71,366)_.

For severe HSV disease, initiating therapy with acyclovir 5-10 mg/kg IV every
8 hours might be necessary.

#### Antiviral resistant HSV

If lesions persist or recur in a patient receiving antiviral treatment, HSV
resistance should be suspected and a viral isolate obtained for sensitivity
testing _(367)_. Such persons should be managed in consultation with an
infectious-disease specialist, and alternate therapy should be administered.
All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant to valacyclovir, and most
are resistant to famciclovir. Foscarnet (40-80 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until
clinical resolution is attained) is often effective for treatment of
acyclovir-resistant genital herpes (368,369). Intravenous cidofovir 5 mg/kg
once weekly might also be effective. Imiquimod is a topical alternative
_(370)_ , as is topical cidofovir gel 1%; however, cidofovir must be
compounded at a pharmacy _(371)_. These topical preparations should be applied
to the lesions once daily for 5 consecutive days.

Clinical management of antiviral resistance remains challenging among persons
with HIV infection, necessitating other preventative approaches. However,
experience with another group of immunocompromised persons (hematopoietic
stem-cell recipients) demonstrated that persons receiving daily suppressive
antiviral therapy were less likely to develop acyclovir-resistant HSV compared
with those who received episodic therapy for outbreaks _(372)_.

###  Genital Herpes in Pregnancy

Most mothers of newborns who acquire neonatal herpes lack histories of
clinically evident genital herpes _(373,374)_. The risk for transmission to
the neonate from an infected mother is high (30%-50%) among women who acquire
genital herpes near the time of delivery and low (<1%) among women with
prenatal histories of recurrent herpes or who acquire genital HSV during the
first half of pregnancy _(375,376)_.

Prevention of neonatal herpes depends both on preventing acquisition of
genital HSV infection during late pregnancy and avoiding exposure of the
neonate to herpetic lesions and viral shedding during delivery. Because the
risk for herpes is highest in newborn infants of women who acquire genital HSV
during late pregnancy, these women should be managed in consultation with
maternal-fetal medicine and infectious-disease specialists.

Women without known genital herpes should be counseled to abstain from vaginal
intercourse during the third trimester with partners known or suspected of
having genital herpes. In addition, pregnant women without known orolabial
herpes should be advised to abstain from receptive oral sex during the third
trimester with partners known or suspected to have orolabial herpes. Type-
specific serologic tests may be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk
for HSV infection and guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring
genital herpes during pregnancy. For example, such testing could be offered to
women with no history of genital herpes whose sex partner has HSV infection.
However, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy to decrease the risk for HSV
transmission to pregnant women by infected partners has not been studied.
Routine HSV-2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not recommended.

All pregnant women should be asked whether they have a history of genital
herpes. At the onset of labor, all women should be questioned carefully about
symptoms of genital herpes, including prodromal symptoms, and all women should
be examined carefully for herpetic lesions. Women without symptoms or signs of
genital herpes or its prodrome can deliver vaginally. Although cesarean
delivery does not completely eliminate the risk for HSV transmission to the
neonate, women with recurrent genital herpetic lesions at the onset of labor
should deliver by cesarean delivery to reduce the risk for neonatal HSV
infection.

Many infants are exposed to acyclovir each year, and no adverse effects in the
fetus or newborn attributable to the use of this drug during pregnancy have
been reported. Acyclovir can be safely used to treat women in all stages of
pregnancy, along with those who are breastfeeding _(317,377)_. Although data
regarding prenatal exposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data
from animal trials suggest these drugs also pose a low risk in pregnant women.
Acyclovir can be administered orally to pregnant women with first-episode
genital herpes or recurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant
women with severe HSV infection. Suppressive acyclovir treatment late in
pregnancy reduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who have
recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of recurrences at term
_(378-380)_. However, such treatment may not protect against transmission to
neonates in all cases _(381)_. No data support use of antiviral therapy among
HSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes.

###  Neonatal Herpes

Newborn infants exposed to HSV during birth, as documented by maternal
virologic testing of maternal lesions at delivery or presumed by observation
of maternal lesions, should be followed carefully in consultation with a
pediatric infectious-disease specialist. Guidance is available on management
of neonates who are delivered vaginally in the presence of maternal genital
HSV lesions _(382)_.

Surveillance cultures or PCR of mucosal surfaces of the neonate to detect HSV
infection might be considered before the development of clinical signs of
neonatal herpes to guide initiation of treatment. In addition, administration
of acyclovir might be considered for neonates born to women who acquired HSV
near term because the risk for neonatal herpes is high for these infants. All
infants who have neonatal herpes should be promptly evaluated and treated with
systemic acyclovir. The recommended regimen for infants treated for known or
suspected neonatal herpes is acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14 days
if disease is limited to the skin and mucous membranes, or for 21 days for
disseminated disease and that involving the central nervous system.
