Group B _Streptococcus_  (group B strep, GBS) are bacteria that come and go
naturally in the body. Most of the time the bacteria are not harmful, but they
can cause serious illness in people of all ages. In fact, group B strep
disease is a common cause of severe infection in newborns. While GBS disease
can be deadly, there are steps pregnant women can take to help protect their
babies.
