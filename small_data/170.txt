_Salmonella_ is a group of bacteria that can live in the intestinal tract of
many different animals. Salmonellosis (sal-mohn-el-OH-sis) is a bacterial
disease caused by _Salmonella._

Although _Salmonella_ is most often spread when a person eats contaminated
food, the bacteria also can be passed between people and animals. Many
different animals and pets can carry these germs. Animals known to commonly
spread _Salmonella_ to humans include

                    * Reptiles (turtles, lizards, and snakes)
                    * Amphibians (frogs and toads)
                    * Poultry (chicks, chickens, ducklings, ducks, geese, and turkeys)
                    * Other birds (parakeets, parrots, and wild birds)
                    * Rodents (mice, rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs)
                    * Other small mammals (hedgehogs)
                    * Farm animals (goats, calves, cows, sheep, and pigs)
                    * Dogs
                    * Cats
                    * Horses

### How do animals and people become infected?

![Two boys look at a turtle. ](/healthypets/images/salmo-5.jpg)

Animals become infected with _Salmonella_ through their environment, by eating
contaminated food, or from their mothers before they are even born or hatched.
Salmonella is naturally in the intestines of many different animals. Animals
with _Salmonella_ shed the bacteria in their stool which can easily
contaminate their body parts (fur, feathers, or scales) and anything in areas
where these animals live and roam (terrarium or aquarium, chicken coop, pen or
fencing, countertops, sinks, etc.). It is important to know that many animals
can carry _Salmonella_ and still appear healthy and clean.

People can get a _Salmonella_ infection if they do not wash their hands after
contact with animals carrying _Salmonella_ or their environment, such as their
bedding, food, or tank water. For

![A boy gives his dog a treat](/healthypets/images/salmo-4.jpg)

example, some pet products, like pet foods and treats, can be contaminated
with _Salmonella_ and other germs. Pet food and treats that may be
contaminated include dry dog or cat food, dog biscuits, pig ears, beef hooves,
and rodents used to feed reptiles (including frozen feeder rodents).
Additionally, reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can
contaminate the water with _Salmonella_ , which can make people sick even if
they don't touch the animal.

### Who is most at risk for serious illness?

Anyone can get sick from _Salmonella_ , but some people are more likely than
others to get salmonellosis. People who are more likely to get salmonellosis
include:

                    * infants;
                    * children 5 years of age and younger;
                    * adults aged 65 and older;
                    * people with weakened immune systems, such as people with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant patients, and people receiving chemotherapy.

![sal](/healthypets/images/salmo-3.jpg)

Special advice is available for people who are at greater risk.

The best way to prevent getting _Salmonella_ from animals is to always _**wash
your hands with soap and running water**_ right after contact with these
animals, their environments, or their stool.

#### **Do  **

![A person washing hands.](/healthypets/images/salmo-2.jpg)

                    * Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water 
                      * Right after touching animals.
                      * After touching your pet's food (like dry dog or cat food, frozen feeder rodents) or treats (like rawhide bones, pig ears, biscuits).
                      * After touching the areas where they live and roam.
                    * Use running water and soap, if possible.
                    * Use hand sanitizer if running water and soap are not available. 
                      * Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water as soon as a sink is available.
                      * Adults should always supervise hand washing for young children.
                    * Use soap or a disinfectant to thoroughly clean any surfaces that have been in contact with animals. Do not let children 5 years of age and younger do this task. Children 6 years of age and older can help with cleaning and disinfecting but only if they are supervised by an adult.
                    * Clean your pet's cage, terrarium, or aquarium and its contents (such as food and water bowls) outdoors, if possible. If you must clean your pet's habitat indoors, use a bathtub or large sink that can be cleaned and disinfected afterward. Avoid using a kitchen sink if possible.
                    * Use a bleach solution to clean and disinfect.

#### **Do Not**

                    * Do not let children 5 years of age and younger, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems handle or touch animals that can spread _Salmonella_ (like turtles, water frogs, or poultry). They should also try not to touch the water from the animals' containers or aquariums.
                    *  Avoid keeping live poultry, amphibians, and reptiles in homes and facilities with children 5 years of age and younger or people with weakened immune systems.![A guinea pig eats zucchini.](/healthypets/images/prevention-ginea.jpg)
                    * Never eat or drink around high-risk animals (like turtles, water frogs, chicks, ducklings), or in areas where they live and roam.
                    * Keep animals away from areas where food and drinks are prepared, served, or stored, such as kitchens or outdoor patios.
                    * Do not ask children 5 years of age and younger, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems to clean pets' habitats and their contents.
                    * Persons 65 years of age and older and those with weak immune systems should wear disposable gloves if they have to clean their pet's habitat.
                    * Once you finish cleaning, throw out the dirty wash water in a toilet or sink that is not used for food preparation or for drinking water.

### What are the symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection?

#### People

People infected with _Salmonella_ might have diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and
abdominal cramps. Infants, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems
are more likely than others to develop severe illness. Please visit CDC's
_Salmonella_ website for more information.

#### Pets

Many animals with _Salmonella_ have no signs of illness at all and appear
healthy. Pets that become sick from _Salmonella_ infection typically have
diarrhea that may contain blood or mucus. Sick animals may seem more tired
than usual and may vomit or have a fever. If your pet has these signs of
illness or you are concerned that your pet may have a _Salmonella_ infection,
please contact your pet's veterinarian.

Since there have been several pet treats recalled due to contamination with
_Salmonella_ , you should tell your veterinarian if your pet recently consumed
a product that has been recalled. Do not feed your pet any more of the
recalled product. Throw the product away immediately.

### How can Salmonella infections be diagnosed and treated?

#### People

_Salmonella_ infections in people usually resolve within 5-7 days, and most do
not require treatment other than drinking plenty of fluids. People with severe
diarrhea may need to spend time in a hospital getting rehydrated with
intravenous fluids. Lab tests are needed to determine if Salmonella is the
cause of a person's illness. For more information about diagnosis and
treatment, please visit CDC's _Salmonella_ website.

#### Pets

If you suspect that your pet has _Salmonella_ , see your veterinarian.
_Salmonella_ infections may require prompt treatment with supportive care and
fluids. If your pet is very sick, it may need to be treated with antibiotics
or be hospitalized in a veterinary clinic. Your pet's veterinarian is the best
source of advice on your pet's health.

Learn more about salmonellosis at CDC's _Salmonella_ website, which includes
answers to frequently asked questions, technical information, and additional
resources.
