_Balantidium coli,_ though rare in the US, is an intestinal protozoan parasite
that can infect humans. These parasites can be transmitted through the fecal-
oral route by contaminated food and water. _Balantidium coli_ infection is
mostly asymptomatic, but people with other serious illnesses can experience
persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes a perforated colon. When
traveling to endemic tropical countries, _Balantidium coli_ infection can be
prevented by following good hygiene practices. Wash all fruits and vegetables
with clean water when preparing or eating them, even if they have a removable
skin.
