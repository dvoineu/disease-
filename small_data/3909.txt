CDC's NTDs Program

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of parasitic and bacterial
diseases that cause substantial illness for more than one billion people
globally. Affecting the world's poorest people, NTDs impair physical and
cognitive development, contribute to mother and child illness and death, make
it difficult to farm or earn a living, and limit productivity in the
workplace. As a result, NTDs trap the poor in a cycle of poverty and disease.
