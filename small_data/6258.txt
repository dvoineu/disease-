These maps can be used to help identify census tracts within states or communities that either lack access to healthy food retailers such as supermarkets or contain very high densities of fast food restaurants and convenience stores relative to the number of healthy food retailers. States and communities can also use data from the mRFEI Data Table excel icon[Excel-5.04MB] to create their own maps using GIS software or link the mRFEI data to other census-tract level data they may have available.
