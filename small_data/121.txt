Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing
about 1 in 4 deaths.1 The term "heart disease" refers to several types of
heart conditions. In the United States, the most common type of heart disease
is coronary artery disease (CAD), which can lead to heart attack. You can
greatly reduce your risk for heart disease through lifestyle changes and, in
some cases, medicine.
