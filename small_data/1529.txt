doctor, even if you don't feel sick. Most people don't show signs or symptoms
of asbestos-related disease for 10 to 20 years or more after exposure. You

What can I do when my landlord, property owner, or builder is not responsive
to my mold problems?

If you feel your landlord, property owner, or builder has not been responsive
to your concerns about mold, you should contact your local board of health or
your local housing authority. Issues about mold generally fall under state and
local, not federal, jurisdiction. These issues can include applicable codes,
insurance, inspection, and legal issues.

You could also review your lease or building contract. You can learn more
about local codes and laws and your legal rights by talking with local or
state government agents, your insurance company, or a lawyer.

CDC does not have enforcement power in such matters. CDC also cannot provide
you with personalized advice. You can contact your county or state health
department about mold issues in your area and to learn about what mold
assessment and remediation removal services it may offer. You can also contact
your state's indoor air quality program.

What should I do if I am worried about mold in my workplace?

If you are worried that there may be mold in your workplaceExternal, contact
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Employers,
employees, or union officials can request a NIOSH health hazard evaluation. If
a field evaluation site visit is conducted, NIOSH will evaluate the current
workplace conditions and employees' health concerns and make recommendations
on how to reduce or eliminate any identified hazards.

If NIOSH does not conduct a site visit, NIOSH will contact management and
employees, by phone and email, to collect information. NIOSH will send a
letter to the employer or building manager with information about the indoor
environmental quality concerns and provide recommendations.

For more information about NIOSH health hazard evaluations, visit the NIOSH
website or call 1-800-232-4636.

What are common causes of poisoning in adults?

Drugs are the most common cause of poisoning in adults. This includes both
legal and illegal drugs.

In drug-related suicides, the most commonly used are psychoactive drugs. This
includes medications used to help people sleep and to treat depression.

Prescription opioids are commonly involved in unintentional and undetermined
poisoning deaths. From 1999-2016, more than 350,000 people died from an
overdose involving an opioid, including prescription and illegal opioids (like
heroin).

If you have a poison emergency, call poison control. The nationwide toll-free
number for poison control centers is _1-800-222-1222._

Poison Control agents can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they

How can suicide be prevented?

Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2017, and it
continues to be a serious public health problem that can have lasting
devastating effects on individuals, families, and communities. While its
causes are complex and determined by multiple factors, the goal of suicide
prevention is to reduce factors that increase risk (i.e. risk factors) and
increase factors that protect people from suicidal thoughts and behaviors
(i.e. protective factors).

Suicide and other forms of violence can be can be addressed through risk and
protective factors at all levels of society, from the individual, family, and
community levels to the broader social environment.

For more information on suicide prevention, visit CDC's Division of Violence
Prevention website.

If you are experiencing crisis or emotional distress, call 1-800-273-TALK
(1-800-273-8255) or visit the National Suicide Prevention LifelineExternal
website to chat with a counselorExternal.
