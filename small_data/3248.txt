Therefore, these medications are active against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses. As in recent past seasons, there continues to be high levels of resistance (>99%) to adamantanes among circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 ("2009 H1N1") viruses. Therefore, amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis of currently circulating influenza A viruses.

1 Oral oseltamivir phosphate is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute
uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 14 days and
older, and for chemoprophylaxis in people 1 year and older. Although not part
of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of
influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in
infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy
of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for
chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical
due to limited data in this age group.  
2 Self-injury or delirium; mainly reported among Japanese pediatric patients.  
3 Inhaled zanamivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute
uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 7 years and
older, and for chemoprophylaxis of influenza in people 5 years and older.
Inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with history of allergy to
milk protein.  
4 Intravenous peramivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute
uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 2 years and
older. Peramivir efficacy is based on clinical trials versus placebo in which
the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; in one trial, a very
limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled.  
5 There are no data for use of peramivir or baloxavir for chemoprophylaxis of
influenza.  
6 Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute
uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and
older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-
related complications. The safety and efficacy of baloxavir for the treatment
of influenza have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older
weighing at least 40 kg. Safety and efficacy in patients < 12 years old or
weighing less than 40 kg have not been established. Baloxavir efficacy for
initial FDA approval in October 2018 was based on clinical trials in
previously healthy outpatients 12 to 64 years old (Hayden, 2018external icon).
Single-dose baloxavir treatment was superior to placebo and had similar
clinical efficacy in time to alleviation of symptoms to a 5-day treatment
course of oseltamivir. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for
baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness
onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-
related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial (Ison,
2018external icon; Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) pdf icon[package
insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019) . In
this clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for
uncomplicated influenza in high-risk patients, baloxavir was superior to
placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to
alleviation of symptoms. For patients with influenza B virus infection,
baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms
compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. However, there are no
available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women,
immunocompromised people, or in people with severe influenza. There are no
available data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of hospitalized
patients with influenza.

However, some studies suggest that antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in hospitalized patients when started up to 4 or 5 days after illness onset (Louie, 2012external icon; Yu, 2011external icon). Antiviral treatment of pregnant women (of any trimester) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been shown to be most beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death when started within less than 3 days of illness onset, but still provided benefit when started 3-4 days after onset compared to 5 or more days (Siston, 2010external icon). One observational study reported that initiating neuraminidase inhibitor treatment within 6 hours after hospital admission was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization versus starting antiviral treatment later (Katzen, 2018external icon). Another observational study reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment initiated at the time of hospitalization was associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection compared with later initiation or no NAI treatment (Venkatesan, 2019external icon).

1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk
for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2
years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants
younger than 6 months old. Because many children with mild febrile respiratory
illness might have other viral infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus,
rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, or human metapneumovirus), knowledge of other
respiratory viruses as well as influenza virus strains circulating in the
community is important for treatment decisions.

Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed
Influenza

Treatment of patients with severe influenza (e.g., those requiring
hospitalization) presents multiple challenges. The effect of specific
antiviral strategies in serious or life-threatening influenza is not
established from clinical trials conducted to support licensure of oral
oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir, as
those studies were conducted primarily among previously healthy outpatients
with uncomplicated illness. No randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials
have been conducted of neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment of influenza in
hospitalized patients. However, a number of observational studies in
hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase
inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when
started within two days of influenza illness, including reducing the duration
of hospitalization or risk of death (Hiba, 2011external icon; Coffin,
2011external icon; Hsu, 2012external icon; Louie, 2013external icon; Muthuri,
2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon _;_Miyakawa, 2019external icon
_;_Lytras, 2019external icon _;_Katzen, 2019;external icon Reacher,
2019external icon).  In addition, some observational studies have reported
that oral oseltamivir treatment started 4 and 5 days after illness onset in
patients hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza was  associated
with lower risk for severe outcomes (EH Lee, 2010external icon; N Lee,
2008external icon; N Lee, 2010external icon; Louie, 2012external icon; McGeer,
2007external icon; Siston, 2010external icon), although one report found this
benefit only in hospitalized adult patients in the ICU (Muthuri, 2014external

observational studies of hospitalized influenza patients reported that
neuraminidase inhibitor treatment did not have survival benefit (Choi,
2017external icon; Wolkewitz, 2016external icon; Heneghan, 2016external icon).

The following recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses
of antiviral products, but are based on published observational studies and
expert opinion and are subject to change as the developmental status of
investigational products and the epidemiologic and virologic features of
influenza change over time.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **For hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.**  Antiviral treatment might be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients, especially adults, even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after onset of illness.

There are also insufficient data for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients with intravenous peramivir. A randomized clinical trialexternal icon of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients aged 12 years and older is in-progress.

Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may detect influenza viruses when testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative. Multiple respiratory tract specimens collected on different days should be tested if influenza virus infection is suspected but a definitive diagnosis has not been made.

Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. For example, clinical judgment should be the guide regarding the need to extend daily treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients whose illness is prolonged. Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and might benefit from longer duration of treatment.

Such patients are at risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or antiviral resistance during or after antiviral treatment.

However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults, with standard doses producing therapeutic blood levels (Ariano, 2010external icon), and available data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit (Abdel-Ghafar, 2008external icon; Ariano, 2010external icon; Kumar, 2010external icon; Lee, 2013external icon; South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network, 2013external icon). Studies indicate that the exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and 150 mg doses given twice daily (Ariano, 2010external icon; Jittamala, 2014external icon; Pai, 2011external icon; Thorne-Humphrey, 2011external icon).

Resistance and reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral drugs can also occur spontaneously, with no known exposure to antiviral medications (Hurt, 2011external icon; Takashita, 2013external icon; Takashita, 2014external icon).

However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications (e.g., renal failure, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia) than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance. Severely immunosuppressed people (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at highest risk for emergence of oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant influenza virus infection during or following oseltamivir and/or peramivir treatment (Hurt, 2012external icon; Memoli, 2010external icon). Molecular analyses can detect genetic changes in influenza viruses associated with resistance and reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. The CDC Influenza Division is available for consultation regarding antiviral susceptibility testing as needed. Information about neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing and interpretation of results of neuraminidase inhibition assays is available on the WHO websiteexternal icon.

1Longer treatment duration may be needed for severely ill patients.  
2Oral oseltamivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated
influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 14
days and older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 1
year and older. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral
oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and
for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by
the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious
Diseases, 2018external icon).  
3This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days
and older and less than 1 year old, and provides oseltamivir exposure in
children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice
daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in
children ( _Kimberlin, 2013 [CASG 114], EU study WP22849, FDA Clinical
Pharmacology Review external icon_). The American Academy of Pediatrics has
recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for
infants 9-11 months old, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher
dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol-defined targeted exposure
for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study ( _Kimberlin, 2013 external
icon_). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or
prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence
that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in
this age group.  
4Current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature
infants. Premature infants might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir
because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term
infants might lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. CDC
recommends dosing as also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics
(Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon): limited data from the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral
Study Group provide the basis for dosing preterm infants using their
postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg/dose,
orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose,
orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age; 3.0
mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks postmenstrual age.

details regarding duration of chemoprophylaxis for outbreaks in institutional
settings.  
6Inhaled zanamivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza
within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 7 years and
older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 5 years and
older.  
7Intravenous peramivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated
influenza within 2 days of illness onset with a single dose in people 2 years
and older. Daily dosing for a minimum of 5 days was used in clinical trials of
hospitalized patients with influenza ( _de Jong, 2014 external icon_, _Ison,
2014 external icon_).  
8There are no data for use of peramivir or baloxavir for chemoprophylaxis of
influenza.

9Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute
uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and
older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-
related complications.  (Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) pdf icon[package

and efficacy in patients less than 12 years old or weighing less than 40 kg
have not been established. Baloxavir marboxil should not be administered with
dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing
laxatives, antacids or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium,
selenium, or zinc); co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing
products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce
efficacy. There are no available published data from clinical trials for
baloxavir treatment of influenza in patients who are pregnant,
immunocompromised, have severe disease, or in hospitalized patients. A
randomized clinical trialexternal icon of baloxavir treatment of influenza in
hospitalized patients 12 years and older is in-progress.

For the treatment of uncomplicated influenza with intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir, a single dose is recommended. Longer daily dosing (oral oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir) can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment.

For control of outbreaks in institutional settings (e.g. long-term care facilities for elderly people and children) and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, including those who have received influenza vaccination. Baloxavir is not currently approved for chemoprophylaxis and is not recommended for chemoprophylaxis due to the lack of data.

Dosing in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Dose adjustment of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine
clearance between 10 and 60 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis receiving
oseltamivir for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is
not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis. The
recommended doses are detailed in Table 3; duration of treatment and
chemoprophylaxis is the same as recommended for patients with normal renal
function. The dose of intravenous peramivir should be reduced for patients
with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min (see Table 3).

No dose adjustment is recommended for inhaled zanamivir for a 5-day course of
treatment for patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not
identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the
pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min
and above. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite, baloxavir, have not been
evaluated.

Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza in Adult Patients with Renal
Impairment or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Dialysis*

| Creatinine Clearance | Recommended Treatment Regimen | **Recommended
Chemoprophylaxis Regimen**  
---|---|---|---  
**Oral oseltamivir 1** | Creatinine clearance 61 to 90 mL/min | 75 mg twice a
day | 75 mg once daily  
Creatinine clearance 31 to 60 mL/min | 30 mg twice a day | 30 mg once daily

1 Renal dosing of oseltamivir is not available in the package insertexternal
icon for pediatric patients. However, these tables may be useful for children
who qualify for adult doses based on weight >40 kg.  
2 Assuming 3 hemodialysis sessions are performed in the 5- day period.
Treatment can be initiated immediately if influenza symptoms develop during
the 48 hours between hemodialysis sessions; however, the post-hemodialysis
dose should still be administered independently of time of administration of
the initial dose.  
3 An initial dose can be administered prior to the start of dialysis.  
4 Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
(CAPD) patients.  
5 Renal dosing from peramivir package insertexternal icon is available for
pediatric patients: Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min: 12 mg/kg (up to maximum
dose of 600 mg); Creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min: 4 mg/kg; Creatinine
clearance 10 to 29 mL/min: 2 mg/kg.
