Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the U.S.
Although the percentage of adults who smoke is at an all-time low in the U.S.,
34 million adults still smoke and therefore continue to be at risk of
developing smoking-related diseases.

This report makes it clear that one of the most important actions people can
take to improve their health is to quit smoking. This is true regardless of
their age or how long they've been smoking.

Quitting smoking can be difficult, but there are proven treatments and
strategies to help people quit smoking successfully. The report outlines the
latest research on these treatments including counseling (in-person and over
the telephone with a quitline) and medications approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). The report also sheds light on new and emerging
opportunities to further promote and support cessation in our country.

We know more about the science of quitting than ever before. Ultimately, the
report serves as a call to action to our nation--we can and must do more to
ensure that proven cessation treatments are reaching the people that need
them.
