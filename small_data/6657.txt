_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_  is a type of "atypical" bacteria that commonly causes
mild infections of the respiratory system. In fact, pneumonia caused by _M.
pneumoniae_ is sometimes referred to as "walking pneumonia" since symptoms
tend to be milder than pneumonia caused by other germs. The most common type
of illness caused by these bacteria, especially in children, is
tracheobronchitis, commonly called a chest cold. Symptoms often include being
tired and having a sore throat, fever, and cough. Sometimes _M. pneumoniae_
can cause pneumonia, a more serious lung infection, which may require care in
a hospital.
