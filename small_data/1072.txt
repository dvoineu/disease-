### What are Widgets?

A widget is a CDC.gov application that displays the featured content directly
on your web page. You can embed content in personalized home pages, blogs, and
other sites. Once you've added the widget, there's no technical maintenance.
CDC.gov will update the content automatically.

Adding a CDC.gov widget to your page means that you will have up-to-date,
credible health and safety content in your favorite spaces - no more searching
or browsing! Stay informed about the health content that is most meaningful to
you.
