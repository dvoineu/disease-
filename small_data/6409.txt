### Criteria Documents

_**Criteria Documents**_ are developed to provide the basis for comprehensive
occupational safety and health standards. These documents generally contain a
critical review of the scientific and technical nformation available on the
prevalence of hazards, the existence of safety and health risks, and the
adequacy of methods to identify and control hazards.

_**Special Hazard Reviews (SHRs) and Occupational Hazard Assessments (OHAs)**_
are written to complement NIOSH recommendations for standards. These documents
assess safety and health problems and recommend appropriate methods for
control and monitoring.

_**Joint Occupational Health Documents (JOHDs)**_ are developed with foreign
government agencies.
