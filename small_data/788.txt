### Pre-Travel Quick Guide

### Your patients are going places: help them have a healthy trip abroad.

Many travelers don't seek health advice when they're planning international
trips, even though their travel may put them at risk for preventable
illnesses. Include travel questions in the routine history you gather from
patients to assess possible risks and identify opportunities for patient
vaccination, medication, and education.

                                                                                                      * Ask about underlying conditions, allergies, and medications.
                                                                                                      * Ask about special conditions, such as pregnancy, immunocompromising conditions, history of heart disease or stroke, and recent surgery.
                                                                                                      * Ask about immunization history.
                                                                                                      * Ask about prior international travel.
                                                                                                      * Get trip details, such as destination, trip length, and reason for travel.
                                                                                                      * Ask about travel style, such as traveling alone or with a group, staying at a hotel or with a host family, and modes of transportation.
                                                                                                      * Ask about special activities, such as providing medical care or doing disaster relief work, doing adventure travel/extreme sports traveling (skydiving), being on a cruise ship, traveling to high altitudes, or being exposed to open water (diving, rafting). Also ask if they expect to be in contact with animals.
