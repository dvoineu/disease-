### West Virginia's Tobacco Control Program Works with Pharmacists to Help
People Quit Smoking

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the
United States, accounting for about 480,000 deaths every year.1 Nationally, an
estimated 14% of adults currently smoke cigarettes and more than 16 million
Americans live with a smoking-related disease.2

In 2016, the West Virginia Division of Tobacco Prevention, part of the state's
Department of Health & Human Services, was looking for new ways to lower the
number of West Virginia adults who smoke tobacco. Nearly 25% of West Virginia
adults were cigarette smokers--the highest percentage of any state in the
country.3 The Tobacco Prevention program staff knew that pharmacists can play
a key role in promoting health by counseling people on how to quit using
tobacco products and by providing nicotine replacement therapies like patches
or gum. Counseling and nicotine replacement therapies are proven, effective
ways to help smokers quit.4 The Tobacco Prevention program staff decided to
work more closely with small pharmacies in rural counties to reduce tobacco
use among West Virginians.

### West Virginia's Tobacco Prevention Staff Partner with Pharmacists

Creative Pharmacist (now known as STRAND Clinical Technologies) works with
pharmacists in over 1,000 independent pharmacies to help patients manage their
chronic health conditions.5 Creative Pharmacist shows CDC's _Tips From Former
Smokers_ ® ads on TVs in these pharmacies--reaching over 2 million customers
in 2 years--to motivate smokers to consider quitting and ask a pharmacist for
advice.6

The Tobacco Prevention program and Creative Pharmacist created a pilot program
to help people quit smoking. The program focused on small pharmacies in 5
rural counties with high smoking rates. As part of the program, pharmacists:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Talked to people who smoked about trying to quit smoking.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Hosted counseling and group support sessions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Used Tips from Former Smokers® ads and other materials to educate people.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Told people who smoked about services offered by the West Virginia Tobacco Quitline, including free phone counseling and 8 weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy.6

### Pharmacy Pilot Program Helps West Virginians Quit Smoking

The pilot program created by this public-private partnership between the
Tobacco Prevention program and pharmacies has helped West Virginians quit
smoking. Fifty adults who smoked cigarettes enrolled in the program. Within 10
weeks of launching the program, 40% of the enrolled clients had quit smoking,
and one-third of the 40% remained quit at 24 weeks. The program was expanded,
with an additional 8 rural pharmacies enrolling 110 clients, 30 of whom had
quit cigarette smoking within 12 weeks. The program continues to be evaluated
and enhanced.6

The partnership between Tobacco Prevention staff, Creative Pharmacist, and
pharmacists in rural counties helped place Tips from Former Smokers®
television ads and other materials related to quitting in rural pharmacies.
When people who smoke see the messages, they can turn to their local
pharmacists for advice on how to quit smoking. As a result of this program,
pharmacists have built stronger relationships with West Virginians who smoke
and are seen as trusted counselors who are willing and able to help people
quit smoking. Tobacco Prevention staff, who are supported with CDC funding and
received technical assistance from CDC for this project, are finding new ways
to reduce tobacco use in West Virginia.
