### Real Stories from People living with an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder

###  April's Story

_This is the personal story of April and her child Sara. From age 9 until age
15, Sara participated with her mother in the ADHD Play and follow-up studies._

"The PLAY interview process was an affirming experience for both me and my
daughter. I realized that ADHD encompasses so much more of a child's life than
his or her behavior. It impacts relationships, family dynamics, school
performance, parental practices, and most of all, a child's concept of self-
worth. I think the biggest struggle for children with ADHD is trying to
conform to traditional school settings, where sitting still, long-term focus,
organizational skills, etc. are rewarded behaviors.

"For each annual interview my daughter and I would always compare notes before
and after the interview. She was curious to see what I said about her in the
pre-interview paperwork, and I was curious to hear about her answers in the
face-to-face interview. It was always a great opportunity for us to talk about
things we didn't usually discuss on a regular basis, such as her self-
confidence, her growing independence, her school performance, her behavior,
and her relationships at home and school.

"Over time, I was able to trace her own self-confidence and sense of security
back to the structure of our home life, her physical fitness activities, her
love for the arts, her relationship with her parents (especially her dad), and
the loving adults who surrounded her. I think we affirmed that having a well-
rounded set of activities, a loving family unit, good routines and limits, and
healthy relationships at school are habits to keep for a lifetime. The
researchers' ability to trace data trends on all aspects of a child's life in
such a comprehensive way will hopefully help those affected by ADHD in the
future."

**_CDC would like to thank April for sharing her personal story._**
