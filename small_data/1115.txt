Chagas disease is named after the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, who
discovered the disease in 1909. It is caused by the parasite _Trypanosoma
cruzi_ , which is transmitted to animals and people by insect vectors and is
found only in the Americas (mainly, in rural areas of Latin America where
poverty is widespread). Chagas disease ( _T. cruzi_ infection) is also
referred to as American trypanosomiasis.
