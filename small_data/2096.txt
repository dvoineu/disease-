**Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** is a broad term that describes conditions
characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two
most common inflammatory bowel diseases are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease. Inflammation affects the entire digestive tract in Crohn's disease
and only the large intestine (also called the colon) in ulcerative colitis.
Both illnesses involved an abnormal response to the body's immune system.
