The following interim guidance may help prevent Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from spreading among people in homes and in
communities. The interim guidance is based on what we currently know about
other viral respiratory infections and MERS-CoV. CDC will update this interim
guidance as additional information becomes available.

This interim guidance is for:

##  Prevention Steps for People Confirmed to Have, or Being Evaluated for,
MERS-CoV Infection

If you are confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection you
should follow the prevention steps below until a healthcare provider or local
or state health department says you can return to your normal activities.

**Stay home**  
You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical
care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public
transportation or taxis.

**Separate yourself from other people in your home**  
As much as possible, you should stay in a different room from other people in
your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.

**Call ahead before visiting your doctor**  
Before your medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell him or
her that you have, or are being evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection. This will
help the healthcare provider's office take steps to keep other people from
getting infected.

**Wear a facemask**  
You should wear a facemask when you are in the same room with other people and
when you visit a healthcare provider. If you cannot wear a facemask, the
people who live with you should wear one while they are in the same room with
you.

**Cover your coughs and sneezes**  
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or you can
cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Throw used tissues in a lined trash can, and
immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

**Wash your hands**  
Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20
seconds. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not
available and if your hands are not visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes,
nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

**Avoid sharing household items**  
You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels,
bedding, or other items with other people in your home. After using these
items, you should wash them thoroughly with soap and water.

**Monitor your symptoms**  
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty
breathing). **Before** going to your medical appointment, call the healthcare
provider and tell him or her that you have, or are being evaluated for, MERS-
CoV infection. This will help the healthcare provider's office take steps to
keep other people from getting infected. Ask your healthcare provider to call
the local or state health department.

##  Prevention Steps for Caregivers and Household Members

If you live with, or provide care at home for, a person confirmed to have, or
being evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection, you should:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Make sure that you understand and can help the person follow the healthcare provider's instructions for medication and care. You should help the person with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Have only people in the home who are essential for providing care for the person. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Other household members should stay in another home or place of residence. If this is not possible, they should stay in another room, or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Restrict visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Keep elderly people and those who have compromised immune systems or certain health conditions away from the person. This includes people with chronic heart, lung or kidney conditions, and diabetes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available and if your hands are not visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wear a disposable facemask, gown, and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, body fluids and/or secretions, such as sweat, saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine, or diarrhea. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Throw out disposable facemasks, gowns, and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Wash your hands immediately after removing your facemask, gown, and gloves.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Avoid sharing household items. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with a person who is confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection. After the person uses these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see below "Wash laundry thoroughly").
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Clean all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, body fluids and/or secretions or excretions on them.

##  Prevention Steps for Close Contacts

If you have had close contact2 with someone who is confirmed to have, or being
evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection, you should:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Monitor your health starting from the day you were first exposed to the person and continue for 14 days after you were last exposed to the person. Watch for these signs and symptoms: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Fever3. Take your temperature twice a day.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Coughing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Shortness of breath.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Other early symptoms to watch for are chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and runny nose.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * If you develop symptoms, follow the prevention steps described above, and call your healthcare provider as soon as possible. **Before** going to your medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell him or her about your possible exposure to MERS-CoV. This will help the healthcare provider's office take steps to keep other people from getting infected. Ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * If you do not have any symptoms, you can continue with your daily activities, such as going to work, school, or other public areas.

You are not considered to be at risk for MERS-CoV infection if you have not
had close contact2 with someone who is confirmed to have, or being evaluated
for, MERS-CoV infection. CDC advises that people follow prevention steps to
help reduce their risk of getting infected with respiratory viruses, like
MERS-CoV. For more information, see CDC's MERS Prevention.

Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC's Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. For detailed information regarding healthcare personnel (HCP) please review CDC Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring and Movement of Persons with Potential Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) Exposure. Transient interactions, such as walking by a person with MERS, are not thought to constitute an exposure; however, final determination should be made in consultation with public health authorities.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen.
