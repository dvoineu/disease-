## Section Two: Packaging Specimens

Packaging consists of the following components: primary receptacles (blood
tubes or urine cups), secondary packaging (materials used to protect primary
receptacles), and outer packaging (polystyrene foam-insulated, corrugated
fiberboard shipper).

The first layer of secondary packaging must be secured with one continuous strip of evidence tape and initialed half on the tape and half on the first layer of secondary packaging by the person making the seal. For example, one of the ways to do this is to--

Verify in advance that the manufacturer of either the blood tube or secondary packaging used in your facility is in compliance with the pressure differential requirement.

The first layer of secondary packaging must be secured with one continuous strip of evidence tape and initialed half on the tape and half on the first layer of secondary packaging by the person making the seal. For example, one of the ways to do this is to--

Seal the top half of the box to the bottom half with one continuous piece of evidence tape and write your initials half on the tape and half on the box.

An example of acceptable material is the Saf-T-Pak Disposable 2-Part Pressure Vessel system or its equivalent.

The entity or organization relinquishing the specimens must sign its chain of custody to close the chain and indicate that they have transferred the specimens.

**Note:** When the person relinquishing the specimens (relinquisher) and the
person receiving the specimens (receiver) are not together at the time of
specimen transfer, the relinquisher must document on its chain-of-custody form
that the receiver is the express courier (e.g., FedEx, Delta Dash, DHL, UPS)
and must document the shipment tracking number or have the person transporting
the specimens sign the chain-of-custody to indicate that he or she has taken
control of the specimens. Likewise, when receivers get the specimens, they
will document on their chain-of-custody form that the relinquisher is the
express courier (and provide the tracking number) or have the person
transporting the specimens sign the chain-of-custody form.
