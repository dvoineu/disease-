# Interim Guidance for Ebola Virus Cleaning, Disinfection, and Waste Disposal
in Commercial Passenger Aircraft

Minus

Related Pages

This guidance addresses the rare event of a traveler having symptoms
consistent with Ebola being present on a commercial passenger aircraft and
later being confirmed to have Ebola. A traveler exhibiting symptoms consistent
with late-stage Ebola on a commercial passenger aircraft is more likely to
have a different sickness than Ebola.

**What flights this applies to** : This guidance applies to commercial
passenger flights arriving in the United States and all domestic flights
within the United States.

**Who this is for** : Airlines and airline employers with personnel working on
passenger aircraft that may transport a sick traveler with symptoms consistent
with Ebola on a flight; also airlines and contract companies whose staff may
clean, disinfect, and remove contaminated waste from an aircraft with a
traveler who, after the flight was completed, was tested and _lab-confirmed_
to have Ebola.

**How to use** : Use these recommendations 1) to develop a protocol for
handling a traveler exhibiting symptoms consistent with Ebola while in flight,
2) to guide personnel in cleaning and disinfecting the aircraft after a
flight, and 3) as a reference for effective disinfectant products and relevant
employee federal regulations. This guidance does not relieve any person of the
obligation to comply with all applicable FAA regulations.

**Related guidance** : CDC's Preventing Spread of Disease on Commercial
Aircraft: Guidance for Cabin Crew details general infection control
precautions and management of a sick traveler in-flight. This guidance
provides additional guidance on cleaning, disinfection, and waste disposal
procedures.

Reporting tools for airlines, cabin crew, and pilots are available in the Airline Guidance for Reporting Death/Illness.

**Lavatory wastes** : Airlines should share the CDC's Interim Guidance for
Managers and Workers Handling Untreated Sewage from Individuals with Ebola in
the United States and Frequently Asked Questions for Managers and Workers
Handling Untreated Sewage from Suspected or Confirmed Individuals with Ebola
in the U.S. Personnel should routinely handle lavatory wastes using proper
personal protective equipment (PPE) and hygiene practices for all flights,
regardless of the presence of a passenger with symptoms consistent with Ebola.
In relation to fecal and urine wastes found in lavatory's, there has been no
evidence to date that Ebola can be transmitted via exposure to sewage (Weber
and Rutala 2001 pdf icon[PDF - 11 pages]external icon).

## While in flight

Airline personnel, using an assistant if needed, should then (1) carefully doff (remove) PPE to avoid contaminating his/herself or their clothes, (2) dispose of the PPE is the designated waste for biohazardous material (double-bagged), and (3) clean hands using soap and water (if visibly soiled) or alcohol sanitizer.

For an ill traveler who had exposure to Ebola and symptoms consistent with Ebola but **NO** gastrointestinal or hemorrhagic symptoms, routine cleaning and laundering can be conducted by airline personnel or designated cleaning crew/environmental services employees because the traveler should not have contaminated the environment. To date, there is no documented evidence of Ebola virus or other hemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g., Marburg, Lassa, etc.) being transmitted on an aircraft.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. For an ill traveler who had exposure to Ebola and symptoms consistent with Ebola, **including** gastrointestinal or hemorrhagic symptoms, refer to the CDC Ebola Guidance for Airlines and specifically the guidance for airline cleaning personnel section, as well as the CDC Infection Control Guidelines for Cabin Crew Members on Commercial Aircraft. Note that contaminated waste should be disposed of in a biohazard bag if available or a secured plastic bag labeled as biohazard.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. In the event a sick traveler, **_lab-confirmed_ for Ebola** after the flight and had gastrointestinal or hemorrhagic symptoms while on the passenger aircraft, the aircraft should be taken out of service immediately. The aircraft should then be assessed by public health and/or assigned authorities or a contract company to determine the proper cleaning, disinfecting, and disposal procedures.

Any contract company conducting such work must comply with its state's Ebola policies and with OSHA standardsexternal icon for, among others that may apply, bloodborne pathogensexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1030), personal protective equipment (PPE)external icon (29 CFR 1910.132), respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134), and hazard communicationexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1200) (e.g., for chemical hazards). In states that operate their own occupational safety and health programs, different or additional requirements may exist. **Only areas that were contaminated with diarrhea, vomit, blood, and/or other body fluids, will need to be cleaned and disinfected**.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The contract company should use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectant (or professional product) with a label claim against a non-enveloped virus, such as norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, or poliovirus, according to manufacturer's instructions. Currently, no EPA-registered disinfectant products will have a statement on the label that specifically says it can kill Ebola virus. However, any EPA-registered hospital disinfectant (or professional product) that is effective against a non-enveloped virus will also be effective against Ebola virus. One simple way to identify an appropriate product effective against Ebola virus is to use a product with a label claim against non-enveloped viruses, such as those included in EPA's List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virusexternal icon. As certain disinfectants may be incompatible with aircraft components, any disinfectant used on board an aircraft should be cleared as acceptable for the aircraft.

The contract company is responsible for selecting and providing PPE to protect their workers from exposure to Ebola virus and to chemical hazards from the cleaning and disinfectant agents. Refer to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrixpdf iconexternal iconfor assistance in determining the appropriate PPE. Where respiratory hazards exist, such as from aerosolized viral particles or chemicals used for cleaning and disinfection, workers must use NIOSH-approved respirators, be fit-tested before using respirators, and be medically cleared. Note that medical clearance for respirators is determined by the institution, which may involve a questionnaire for screening, physical examination and spirometry, and/or chest x-ray.
