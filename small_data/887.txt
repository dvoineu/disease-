The Prevention and Public Health Fund was established under Section 4002 of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). Also known as
the Prevention Fund or PPHF, it is the nation's first mandatory funding stream
dedicated to improving our nation's public health system. By law, the
Prevention Fund must be used "to provide for expanded and sustained national
investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help
restrain the rate of growth in private and public health care costs."

Since 2010, CDC has received ACA resources for public health programs to
reduce the leading causes of death and disability, support early detection of
and response to health threats, and expand evidence-based strategies. OFR
coordinates ACA and PPHF activities at CDC by:
