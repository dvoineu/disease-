Summary of the Second Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
(ME/CFS) Roundtable Meeting held August 30, 2018

CDC held a second roundtable meeting on August 30, 2018 with stakeholders
composed of ME/CFS patients, advocates, clinicians with ME/CFS expertise,
healthcare professional organizations, medical educators,
researchers/foundations, and other government agencies. Building on the first
roundtable project, the goal of this project was to provide an opportunity for
individuals to share their thoughts on ME/CFS educational materials for
patients as well as materials focused on the needs of healthcare providers.
The project included various phases using small conference calls and the face-
to-face meeting.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Roundtable Summary pdf icon[PDF - 118KB]
