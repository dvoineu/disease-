### Epilepsy Prevalence in the United States

In 2015, 1.2% of the US population had active epilepsy (95% CI* = 1.1-1.4).
This is about 3.4 million people with epilepsy nationwide: **3 million
adults** and **470,000 children**.  Find the prevalence estimates for your
state in the data table below. Learn more about epilepsy and public health in
your state by visiting the Resources for States at the bottom of the page.

### What Is Active Epilepsy?

An adult aged 18 or older has _active epilepsy_ if they report they have a
history of doctor-diagnosed epilepsy or seizure disorder and

                      * Are currently taking medication to control it or
                      * Had one or more seizures in the past year (or both) (from the National Health Interview Survey, 2015).

A child aged 17 years or younger has _active epilepsy_ if their parent or
guardian reports:

                      * That a doctor or health care provider has ever told them that their child had epilepsy or seizure disorder, and
                      * Their child currently has epilepsy or seizure disorder (from the National Survey of Children's Health, 2011-2012).

read the full study.



### Active Epilepsy Prevalence, by State

*CI = Confidence Interval. CI describes the level of uncertainty of an estimate and specifies the range in which the true value is likely to fall. These reports use a 95% level of significance, which means that 95% of the time, the true value falls within these boundaries.
