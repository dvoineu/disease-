Adult BMI Calculator

A high amount of body fat can lead to weight-related diseases and other health
issues. Being underweight is also a health risk. Body Mass Index (BMI) and
waist circumference are screening tools to estimate weight status in relation
to potential disease risk. However, BMI and waist circumference are not
diagnostic tools for disease risks. A trained healthcare provider should
perform other health assessments to evaluate disease risk and diagnose disease
status.

### How to Measure and Interpret Weight Status

#### Adult Body Mass Index or BMI

BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness, and a low BMI can indicate
too low body fatness. To calculate your BMI, see the BMI Calculator. Or
determine your BMI by finding your height and weight in this BMI Index

Weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given
height is described as overweight or obese. Weight that is lower than what is
considered as healthy for a given height is described as underweight.1

At an individual level, BMI can be used as a screening tool but is not
diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. A trained
healthcare provider should perform appropriate health assessments in order to
evaluate an individual's health status and risks.

### How to Measure Height and Weight for BMI

Height and weight must be measured to calculate BMI. It is most accurate to
measure height in meters and weight in kilograms. However, the BMI formula has
been adapted for height measured in inches and weight measured in pounds.
These measurements can be taken in a healthcare provider's office, or at home
using a tape measure and scale.

Another way to estimate your potential disease risk is to measure your waist
circumference. Excessive abdominal fat may be serious because it places you at
greater risk for developing obesity-related conditions, such as Type 2
Diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. Your waistline may
be telling you that you have a higher risk of developing obesity-related
conditions if you are1:

Waist circumference can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of
the body fatness or health of an individual. A trained healthcare provider
should perform appropriate health assessments in order to evaluate an
individual's health status and risks.
