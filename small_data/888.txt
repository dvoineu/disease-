# Role and Value to CDC

Minus

Related Pages

**At CDC, OFR 's role is greater than compliance and enforcement.**  
Contract and grant officers work closely with Program Officials, complementing
their scientific and public health knowledge, with expertise and guidance in
best business practices.

Federal contracts and grants are highly regulated areas governed by many laws,
regulations, and policies. While contract and grant policies may seem
overwhelming and sometimes burdensome, they promote fairness and transparency,
encourage competition, and safeguard the interests of CDC, the government, and
American taxpayers.

Warranted contract and grant officers are the only individuals who can award
contracts and grants. These officers must meet specific educational, training,
experience, and certification requirements. As critical safeguards, they bear
responsibility of ensuring compliance and enforcement of all applicable laws,
regulations, and policies.
