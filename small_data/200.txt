Strongyloidiasis was first described in French troops who had returned from
modern day Vietnam during the late 19th century who were suffering from
severe, persistent diarrhea. It is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes, or
roundworms, in the genus _Strongyloides._ The parasites enter the body through
exposed skin, such as bare feet. _Strongyloides_ is most common in tropical or
subtropical climates.

Most people who are infected with _Strongyloides_ do not know they are
infected and have no symptoms. Others, particularly those who are on some
immunosuppressive therapies, may develop a severe form and, if untreated,
become critically ill and possibly die.
