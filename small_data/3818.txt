Guidance and tools developed for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness
can serve as appropriate resources for health departments during the COVID-19
outbreak. Find those resources here.

The whole community (e.g., individuals, families, communities, businesses, and
jurisdictions) needs to plan for disasters and emergencies, and the
disruptions that often result. Click the links below to learn how families,
businesses, healthcare facilities, and government organizations can prepare
