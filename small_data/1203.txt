CDC-INFO is experiencing a very high number of calls and emails. Wait times
for inquiries on all topics are longer than usual. **However, if you are a
healthcare provider and your inquiry is urgent, please call** instead of
sending through the form.

**Due to the high volume of inquiries, CDC is working to assist those with the
most urgent information needs. If you have general questions regarding
COVID-19, please see the CDCâs Coronavirus Disease 2019FAQ page for timely
information instead of submitting an email. This is a rapidly evolving
situation, and CDC will provide information on our website as soon as it
becomes available. **

You may also access CDCâs new online Coronavirus Self-Checker tool from this
webpage. This tool can help you make decisions about seeking appropriate
medical care if you think you are sick with COVID-19.

 **NOTE: If you submitted an inquiry between the dates of February 29 and
March 9, 2020: Due to extremely high volume, many general public inquiries
submitted via the webform between these dates, will not receive a reply from
CDC-INFO. **If you submitted an inquiry within this time period and _you still
need a response_ , please resubmit your inquiry through the webform or call
CDC-INFO. We apologize for the delay.
