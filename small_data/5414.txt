_Cronobacter_ , which used to be called _Enterobacter sakazakii_ , is a germ
that can live in very dry places. _Cronobacter_ has been found in dry foods,
like powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. It has
also been found in sewer water. _Cronobacter_ infections are often very
serious for babies; they can die. _Cronobacter_ infection can also be very
serious for older people and people whose bodies have trouble fighting germs,
like people with HIV, organ transplants, or cancer.
