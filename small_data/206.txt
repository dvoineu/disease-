Swimmer's itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin rash
caused by an allergic reaction to certain parasites that infect some birds and
mammals. These microscopic parasites are released from infected snails into
fresh and salt water (such as lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite's
preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into
contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction
and rash. Swimmer's itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent
during summer months. Most cases of swimmer's itch do not require medical
attention. _Image: Left: Cercariae of_ Austrobilharzia variglandis _(left),
which can cause cercarial dermatitis. Note the forked "tail" and a pair of
"eye spots" near the anterior end (right). Right: A group of geese, a
preferred host of the parasite that causes cercarial dermatitis. Credit: DPDx_
