Specify column locations for each variable as needed by the software you are using.

**Note:** SAS and SPSS programs need to be used to convert ASCII into SAS and
SPSS datasets. How to use the ASCII data varies from one software package to
another. Column positions for each variable usually have to be specified.
Column positions for each variable can be found in the documentation for each
year's data. Consult your software documentation for more information.

Open the SAS Input Program in SAS and edit it according to the instructions included in the comments in the program.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              5. Run the program. This will read the ASCII data file and convert it into a permanent SAS dataset for the particular year in the folder specified in the SAS program.

**Note:** Each year of YRBSS data should go in its own folder because each
year has its own format library. Format libraries are not comparable across
years. See SAS Format Library for more information.

The SAS format library contains the formats used to make SAS output more
readable. Formats are linked to the data so that results are displayed as
words ("Male" or "Female", for instance) instead of numbers (1 or 2). The SAS
YRBS data file is designed to use its companion format library.

The following example SAS program shows how to use the format library. It
assumes that both the data file and the format library are in "c:data". Note
that the program contains two libname statements. The first libname statement
indicates where the data file is located; the second libname statement
indicates where the format library is located.

libname mydata 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the data are */  
libname library 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the formats are */

proc freq data=mydata.yrbs2005;  
tables q2;

run;

Using the format library is recommended but technically is optional. If you do
not want to use the format library, include the following statement at the
start of your SAS program:

options nofmterr; /* tells SAS to not look for formats */

Please note that each year of YRBS data has its own format library. Format
libraries are not the same across years of data.

For further information on using format libraries, please consult your SAS
documentation.
