**Learn about the symptoms of ADHD and what to do if you 're concerned that
your child might have this disorder.**

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common
neurobehavioral disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in
childhood and often lasts into adulthood.

### Signs and Symptoms

It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or
another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors.
The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at
home, or with friends.

A child with ADHD might:

### Diagnosis of ADHD

Deciding if a child has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is no
single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like anxiety,
depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities, can
have similar symptoms. One step of the process involves having a medical exam,
including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other problems with symptoms
like ADHD. Another part of the process may include a checklist for rating ADHD
symptoms and taking a history of the child from parents, teachers, and
sometimes, the child.

### Treatment for ADHD

ADHD can be successfully managed. Treatment options for ADHD include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Behavior therapy, including training for parents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Medications
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * School accommodations and interventions

In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior therapy and
medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD, behavior
therapy, particularly training for parents, is recommended as the first line
of treatment. What works best can depend on the child and family. Good
treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes,
if needed, along the way.

### Get Help!

If you or your doctor has concerns about ADHD, you can take your child to a
specialist such as a child psychologist or developmental pediatrician, or you
can contact your local early intervention agency (for children under 3) or
public school (for children 3 and older).

To find help in your area, look for the closest Parent Center.external icon
