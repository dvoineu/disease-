Lujo hemorrhagic fever (LUHF) is caused by Lujo virus, a single-stranded virus
of the Arenaviridae family. The limited clinical information about LUHF comes
from a small, nosocomial cluster of hemorrhagic disease in September-October
2008 involving 5 patients in South Africa. The case fatality rate was 80% (4/5
cases).

The first patient, whose source of infection was unknown, was the source of
infection of 3 health care workers. A tertiary infection occurred in a fourth
healthcare worker who received ribavirin treatment and was the only survivor.
Lujo virus is the second African hemorrhagic fever virus described. (Lassa
virus was identified in 1969.)

Transmission

Humans can contract LUHF through contact with an infected rodent...

Signs and Symptoms

In documented cases, clinical course started by a non-specific febrile
illness...

Risk of Exposure

LUHF occurs in southern Africa. Field workers are at greatest risk...

Diagnosis

Lujo virus can be isolated from blood from 2-13 days after onset...

Treatment

Supportive therapy is important in Lujo hemorrhagic fever...

Prevention

Rodent control will not be a successful strategy for preventing Lujo...
