# History of the Surgeon General's Reports on Smoking and Health

On January 11, 1964, Luther L. Terry, M.D., Surgeon General of the U.S. Public
Health Service, released the first report of the Surgeon General's Advisory
Committee on Smoking and Health.

On the basis of more than 7,000 articles relating to smoking and disease
already available at that time in the biomedical literature, the Advisory
Committee concluded that cigarette smoking is--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A probable cause of lung cancer in women
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The most important cause of chronic bronchitis

The release of the report was the first in a series of steps, still being
taken more than 40 years later, to diminish the impact of tobacco use on the
health of the American people.

For several days, the report furnished newspaper headlines across the country
and lead stories on television newscasts. Later it was ranked among the top
news stories of 1964.

During the more than 40 years that have elapsed since that report, individual
citizens, private organizations, public agencies, and elected officials have
pursued the Advisory Committee's call for "appropriate remedial action."

Early on, the U.S. Congress adopted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act of 1965 and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.
These laws--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Required a health warning on cigarette packages
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Banned cigarette advertising in the broadcasting media
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Called for an annual report on the health consequences of smoking

In September 1965, the Public Health Service established a small unit called
the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health.

Through the years, the Clearinghouse and its successor organization, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health,
have been responsible for 29 reports on the health consequences of smoking.

In close cooperation with voluntary health organizations, the Public Health
Service has--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Disseminated research findings related to tobacco use
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Ensured the continued public visibility of antismoking messages

Within this evolving social milieu, the population has given up smoking in
increasing numbers. Nearly half of all living adults who ever smoked have
quit.

The antismoking campaign is a major public health success with few parallels
in the history of public health. It is being accomplished despite the
addictive nature of tobacco and the powerful economic forces promoting its
use.

However, more than 45 million American adults still smoke, more than 8 million
are living with a serious illness caused by smoking, and about 438,000
Americans die prematurely each year as a result of tobacco use.

Efforts to implement proven interventions must be continued and expanded.
