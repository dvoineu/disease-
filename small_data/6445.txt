# Decontamination and Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators

Related Pages

**Disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are not approved for
routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care. However, FFR
decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity
strategy to ensure continued availability. Based on the limited research
available, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and
moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs.
This document summarizes research about decontamination of FFRs before
reuse.**

# Introduction

Reusing disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has been suggested
as a contingency capacity strategy to conserve available supplies for
healthcare environments during a pandemic. Strategies for FFR extended use and
reuse (without decontamination of the respirator) are currently available from
CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

The surfaces of an FFR may become contaminated while filtering the inhalation
air of the wearer during exposures to pathogen-laden aerosols. The pathogens
on the filter materials of the FFR may be transferred to the wearer upon
contact with the FFR during activities such as adjusting the FFR, improper
doffing of the FFR, or when performing a user-seal check when redoffing a
previously worn FFR. A study evaluating the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 (the
virus that causes COVID-19) on plastic, stainless steel, and carboard surfaces
showed that the virus is able to survive for up to 72-hours [1]. One strategy
to mitigate the contact transfer of pathogens from the FFR to the wearer
during reuse is to issue five respirators to each healthcare worker who may
care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The healthcare worker
will wear one respirator each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at
the end of each shift. The order of FFR use should be repeated with a minimum
of five days between each FFR use. This will result in each worker requiring a
minimum of five FFRs, providing that they put on, take off, care for them, and
store them properly each day. Healthcare workers should treat the FFRs as
though they are still contaminated and follow the precautions outlined in our
reuse recommendations. If supplies are even more constrained and five
respirators are not available for each worker who needs them, FFR
decontamination may be necessary.

Decontamination and subsequent reuse of FFRs should only be practiced as a
crisis capacity strategy. At present, FFRs are considered one time use and
there are no manufacturer authorized methods for FFR decontamination prior to
reuse. On March 28, 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)
permitting the Battelle Decontamination Systemexternal icon at Battelle
Memorial Institute to be authorized for use in decontaminating "compatible N95
respirators." The FDA websiteexternal icon should be checked to determine if
other EUAs have been issued since the posting of this crisis capacity strategy
guidance. Only respirator manufacturers can reliably provide guidance on how
to decontaminate their specific models of FFRs. In absence of manufacturer's
recommendations, third parties may also provide guidance or procedures on how
to decontaminate respirators without impacting respirator performance.
Decontamination might cause poorer fit, filtration efficiency, and
breathability of disposable FFRs as a result of changes to the filtering
material, straps, nose bridge material, or strap attachments of the FFR. **CDC
and NIOSH do not recommend that FFRs be decontaminated and then reused as
standard care. This practice would be inconsistent with their approved use,
but we understand in times of crisis, this option may need to be considered
when FFR shortages exist.**

An effective FFR decontamination method should reduce the pathogen burden,
maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard. The
filter media in NIOSH-approved respirators varies by manufacturer. The ability
of the respirator filter media to withstand cleaning and disinfection are not
NIOSH performance requirements. The NIOSH's National Personal Protective
Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) and other researchers have investigated the
impact of various decontamination methods on filtration efficiency, facepiece
fit of FFRs, and the ability to reduce viable virus or bacteria on the FFRs.
This research is summarized below.

# Crisis Standards of Care Decontamination Recommendations

Because ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), vaporous hydrogen peroxide
(VHP), and moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to
decontaminate FFRs, researchers, decontamination companies, healthcare
systems, or individual hospitals should focus current efforts on these
technologies. Specifically, the effectiveness of using these methods should be
explored further with specific FFR models based on the manufacturers' support
to better understand the impact on the respirator performance, including
filtration and fit. The respirator manufacturer should be consulted about the
impact of the method on their respirators prior to considering the use of any
method.

When information from the manufacturer or a third-party is available showing
that respirators can be successfully decontaminated without impacting
respirator performance, then FFRs decontaminated following those
recommendations can be worn for any patient care activities.

In the absence of guidance or when information is available that a respirator
cannot be decontaminated without negatively impacting the performance,
respirators may still be decontaminated. However, given the uncertainties on
the impact of decontamination on respirator performance, these FFRs should not
be worn by HCPs when performing or present for an aerosol-generating
procedure.

No current data exists supporting the effectiveness of these decontamination
methods specifically against SARS-CoV-2 on an FFR. Other pathogens may also be
present on FFRs and there is only limited data available for other pathogens.
Further work is needed to assure SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens are
inactivated. Therefore, even after decontamination, these FFRs should be
handled carefully.

HCPs should take the following precautionary measures prior to using a
decontaminated FFR:

# Vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist
heat are the most promising FFR decontamination methods

Vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist heat
are the most promising decontamination methods. If FFR decontamination is
considered, these methods do not appear to break down filtration or compromise
the FFR; however, many of these methods can only be used for limited times.

## Vaporous hydrogen peroxide

Investigations into VHP decontamination of FFRs provides evidence of minimal
effect to filtration and fit while demonstrating 99.9999% efficiency in
killing bacterial spores. VHP did not reduce the filtration performance of the
ten N95 FFR models tested while showing a 6-log reduction in _Geobacillus
stearothermophilus_ spores [2-4]. In a report prepared by Battelle Memorial
Institute, the 3M 1860 FFR was shown to maintain filtration performance for 50
treatment cycles of VHP, also referred to as HPV by some decontamination
system manufacturers, using the Clarus® R HPV generator form Bioquell
(utilizing 30% H2O2). Additionally, FFR fit was shown to be unaffected for up
to 20 VHP treatments cycles using NPPTL's Static Advanced Headform [4, 5].
Strap degradation occurred after 20 treatment cycles. Kenney et al., co-
contaminated 3M 1870 FFRs with three bacteriophages, T1, T7, and Phi 6, and
decontaminated the FFRs using VHP generated from the Bioquell's BQ-50 system.
The VHP treatment was shown inactivate >99.999% of all phages which was below
the limit of detection [6]. Viscusi et al. found that 9 FFR models (three
particulate N95, three surgical N95 FFRs and three P100) exposed to one cycle
of VHP treatment using the STERRAD 100S H2O2 Gas Plasma Sterilizer (Advanced
Sterilization Products, Irvine, CA) had filter aerosol penetration and filter
airflow resistance levels similar to untreated models; however, Bergman et al.
found that  three cycles of VHP treatment using the STERRAD 100S H2O2 Gas
Plasma Sterilizer negatively affected filtration performance [2, 3]. Bergman
et al. measured acceptable filtration performance for six FFR models (three
particulate and three surgical FFRs) that received three cycles of VHP
treatment using the Clarus® R HPV generator (utilizing 30% H2O2) [3]. VHP is a
promising method with a potential for high capacity throughput, but certain
VHP systems, such as the Clarus® R HPV generator, may be more compatible with
FFR decontamination.

## Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation

UVGI is a promising method but the disinfection efficacy is dependent on dose.
Not all UV lamps provide the same intensity thus treatment times would have to
be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, UVGI is unlikely to kill all the viruses
and bacteria on an FFR due to shadow effects produced by the multiple layers
of the FFR's construction. Acceptable filtration performance was recorded for
eleven FFR models exposed to various UV doses ranging from roughly 0.5-950
J/cm2 and UVGI was shown to have minimal effect on fit [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10].
Heimbuch et al. tested filtration and fit of 15 FFRs and found no adverse
effects to FFR performance [11]. Lindsley et al. reported a reduction of the
durability of materials of the FFRs for doses ranging from 120-950 J/cm2;
however, an approximate inactivation of 99.9% of bacteriophage MS2, a non-
enveloped virus, and H1N1 influenza A/PR/8/34 were achieved with much lower
doses of approximately 1 J/cm2 [12-14]. Heimbuch et al. tested the performance
of 1 J/cm2 of UVGI against Influenza A (H1N1), Avian influenza A virus (H5N1),
Influenza A (H7N9) A/Anhui/1/2013, Influenza A (H7N9) A/Shanghai/1/2013, MERS-
CoV, and SARS-CoV and reported virus inactivation from 99.9% to greater than
99.999% [11]. UVGI is harmful. Proper precautions are required to avoid UVGI
exposure to skin or the eyes.

## Moist heat

Moist heat, consisting of 60°C and 80% RH caused minimal degradation in the
filtration and fit performance of the tested FFRs [3, 9, 10]. Heimbuch et al.
disinfected FFRs contaminated with H1N1 using moist heat, of 65°C and 85% RH,
and achieved a minimal of 99.99% reduction in virus [14]. One limitation of
the moist heat method is the uncertainty of the disinfection efficacy for
various pathogens.

# Steam treatment and liquid hydrogen peroxide are promising methods with some
limitations

## Steam treatment

Steam treatment may be a suitable approach for decontaminating FFRs. The
limited number of studies for steam report minimal effect on FFR filtration
and fit performance and a minimum 99.9% reduction in H1N1 and bacteriophage
MS2 [14, 15]. Fisher et al. used microwave steam bags, designed for
disinfecting infant feeding equipment, to decontaminate six FFR models and
achieved 99.9% inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage. Filtration performance of
all tested FFRs scored above NIOSH certification requirements. Three FFRs were
further evaluated for three cycles of steam exposure and demonstrated no
change in filtration performance [15]. Bergman et al. also demonstrated
acceptable filtration performance after three cycles of exposure to microwave
generated steam [3]. Microwave generated steam had little effect on FFR fit
after exposure to up to three cycles of steam [9, 10]. Using microwaves to
produce steam to decontaminate FFRs is not without limitations. Not all
microwaves are constructed the same and some are more powerful than others.
The effect of higher power microwaves on FFRs is unknown. Furthermore, the
metal nosebands of FFRs may cause arcing, sparks inside the microwave oven,
during exposure to microwaves.

## Liquid hydrogen peroxide

Liquid hydrogen peroxide showed no effect of FFR filtration performance [3,
7]. Bergman et al. evaluated six FFRs for filtration performance after a
30-minute submersion in 6% hydrogen peroxide. All six FFR models tested
demonstrated no changes in filter performance after three cycles of
decontamination. FFR fit and disinfection efficacy were not assessed for this
method.

Table 4 provides a summary of the decontamination methods evaluated for each
FFR model.

# Decontamination methods that changed FFR performance or function

Autoclaving and the use of disinfectant wipes are not recommended as crisis
strategies as they may alter FFR performance.

## Autoclave, dry heat, isopropyl alcohol, soap, dry microwave irradiation and
bleach

Decontamination using an autoclave, 160°C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol,
microwave irradiation and soap and water caused significant filter degradation
to both FFRs and particle penetration levels did not meet the levels that
NIOSH would allow for approval. Decontamination with bleach caused slight
degradation in filtration performance and created an odor that would not be
suitable for use [2, 7].

## Disinfectant wipes

Heimbuch et al. evaluated biological decontamination efficacy and filtration
penetration following aerosol exposure of mucin or viable _Staphylococcus
aureus_ [18]. Following aerosol exposure, respirators were cleaned with three
types of wipes: hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), or
nonantimicrobial. Particle penetration following cleaning yielded mean values
<5%. The highest penetrations were observed in FFRs cleaned with BAC wipes.
The BAC wipe caused one sample of FFRs to exceed 5% penetration. Filter
penetration following various decontamination methods was shown in this study
to vary based on the decontamination method and the model of FFR.

# Ethylene oxide as a promising method with serious limitation

Ethylene oxide is not recommended as a crisis strategy as it may be harmful to
the wearer.

Ethylene oxide (EtO) was shown to not harm filtration performance for the nine
tested FFR models [2, 3, 7]. All tests were conducted for one hour at 55˚C
with EtO gas concentrations ranging from 725 to 833 g/L. Six models that were
exposed to three cycles of 736 mg/L EtO all passed the filtration performance
assessment [3]. Data is not available for the effect that EtO treatment may
have on FFR fit. However, EtO treatment does not cause visible physical
changes to the appearance of FFRs [2, 3]. A serious concern about using EtO
for decontamination of large numbers of FFRs is throughput, since relatively
long aeration cycles are needed to ensure removal of highly toxic EtO gas [2].
Any use of ethylene oxide (EtO) should be accompanied by studies to ensure no
off-gassing into the breathing zone of the wearer as EtO is carcinogenic and
teratogenic. Chronic inhalation of EtO has been linked to neurologic
dysfunction and may cause other harmful effects to the wearer [16]. EtO should
be used in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration
standard 29 CFR 1910.1047 [17].

# Other methods for consideration which have not been tested

Hospitals may have other decontamination capabilities on-hand that may be
feasible. For example, photodynamic inactivation of pathogens using methylene
blue plus visible light exposure is used to treat blood products and there is
interest in using the method to decontaminate PPE. There is currently no data
to evaluate the effect of this method on FFR filtration and fit [19].
