Rapid implementation of mobile technology for real-time epidemiology of
COVID-19  
DA Drew et al, MEDRXIV, April 6, 2020

The COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium brings together
scientists with expertise in big data research and epidemiology to develop a
COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application garnering more than 2.25 million
users to date. This mobile application offers data on risk factors, herald
symptoms, clinical outcomes, and geographical hot spots.

COVID-19 PM2.5: A national study on long-term exposure to air pollution and
COVID-19 mortality in the United States  
Harvard University, April 6, 2020

Data was collected for approximately 3,000 counties in the United States (98%
of the population) up to April 04, 2020. The study found that an increase of
only 1 µg/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with a 15% increase in the COVID-19 death
rate, 95% confidence interval (CI) (5%, 25%). Results are statistically
significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Children: What Pediatric Health Care Clinicians
Need to Know  
SA Rasmussen et al, JAMA Pediatrics, April 5, 2020

While early data suggest that #COVID19 effects on children are less severe
than those on adults, yet many questions remain, especially regarding the
effects on children with special health care needs.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children -- United States, February 12-April 2,
2020  
CDC MMWR, April 6, 2020

Among 345 pediatric cases, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition. The
most common underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (including asthma)
(40), cardiovascular disease (25), and immunosuppression (10). 77% of
hospitalized patients, including all six patients admitted to an ICU, had one
or more underlying medical condition.

### About Coronavirus Disease Portal

Coronavirus Disease Portal is an online, continuously updated, searchable
database of published scientific literature, CDC and NIH resources, and other
materials that captures emerging discoveries and applications of genomics,
molecular and other precision medicine and precision public health tools in
the investigation and control of coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, MERS-CoV,
and SARS. Contents of Coronavirus Disease Portal include PubMed records via an
automated pubmed search algorithm, the relevant information picked by experts,
and linkages to contents from our curated PHGKB databases.
