###  What Is Heart Disease and Stroke?

Heart disease and stroke are cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) diseases
(CVDs).1

Heart disease includes several types of heart conditions. The most common type
in the United States is coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery
disease), which is narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the
heart.2,3 This can cause:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Chest pain2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs)2,5
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Arrhythmia (when the heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly)2,6

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or when a blood
vessel in the brain bursts, causing brain tissue to die.7 Stroke can cause
disability (such as paralysis, muscle weakness, trouble speaking, memory
loss)8 or death.

###  How Is Breathing Secondhand Smoke Related to Heart Disease and Stroke?

Breathing secondhand smoke also harms your health. Secondhand smoke is the
smoke from burning tobacco products.9,11,12 Secondhand smoke also is smoke
breathed out by a smoker.11,12

Breathing secondhand smoke can cause coronary heart disease, including heart
attack and stroke.9,11,13 Know the facts:9

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Nonsmokers who breathe secondhand smoke at home or at work increase their risk of developing heart disease by 25-30%. Secondhand smoke increases the risk for stroke by 20−30%.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Each year, secondhand smoke exposure causes more than 8,000 deaths from stroke.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Breathing secondhand smoke interferes with the normal functioning of the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase your risk of having a heart attack.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Even briefly breathing secondhand smoke can damage the lining of blood vessels and cause your blood to become stickier. These changes can cause a deadly heart attack.

###  How Can Heart Disease and Stroke Be Prevented?

Heart disease and stroke are major causes of death and disability in the
United States. Many people are at high risk for these diseases and don't know
it. The good news is that many risk factors for heart disease and stroke can
be prevented or controlled.

The federal government's Million Hearts®external icon initiative aims to
prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. It's important to know
your risk for heart disease and stroke and to take action to reduce that risk.
A good place to start is with the ABCS of heart health:14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **A** spirin: Aspirin may help reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. But do not take aspirin if you think you are having a stroke. It can make some types of stroke worse. Before taking aspirin, talk to your doctor about whether aspirin is right for you.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **B** lood pressure: Control your blood pressure.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **C** holesterol: Manage your cholesterol.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **S** moking: Quit smoking, or don't start.

In addition to your ABCS, several lifestyle choices can help protect your
heart and brain health. These include the following:13,14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Avoid breathing secondhand smoke.
