Adults who have lower levels of educational attainment, who are unemployed, or
who live at, near, or below the U.S. federal poverty level are considered to
have low socioeconomic status (SES).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in 2016 was 12.7%.1 In
2017, the percentage of people aged 18 and older who had completed only high
school was 28.9%, and the percentage who had completed high school up to grade
11 but had no diploma was 4.2%.2

In the U.S., people living below the poverty level and people having lower
levels of educational attainment have higher rates of cigarette smoking than
the general population.3,4

### Health Effects

#### Cigarette smoking disproportionately affects the health of people with
low SES. Lower income cigarette smokers suffer more from diseases caused by
smoking than do smokers with higher incomes.5

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Populations in the most socioeconomically deprived groups have higher lung cancer risk than those in the most affluent groups.6
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People with less than a high school education have higher lung cancer incidence than those with a college education.5,7
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People with family incomes of less than $12,500 have higher lung cancer incidence than those with family incomes of $50,000 or more.7
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People living in rural, deprived areas have 18-20% higher rates of lung cancer than people living in urban areas.6
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Lower-income populations have less access to health care, making it more likely that they are diagnosed at later stages of diseases and conditions.5

### Patterns of Cigarette Smoking

#### People with low SES tend to smoke cigarettes more heavily.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People living in poverty smoke cigarettes for a duration of nearly twice as many years as people with a family income of three times the poverty rate.8
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People with a high school education smoke cigarettes for a duration of more than twice as many years as people with at least a bachelor's degree.8
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Blue-collar workers are more likely to start smoking cigarettes at a younger age and to smoke more heavily than white-collar workers.9

### Secondhand Smoke Exposure

#### Secondhand smoke exposure is higher among people living below the poverty
level and those with less education.10

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Low SES populations are more likely to suffer the harmful health consequences of exposure to secondhand smoke.10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Blue-collar workers are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at work than white-collar workers.9
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Service workers, especially bartenders and wait staff, report the lowest rates of workplace smoke-free policies than other occupation categories.11

### Quitting Behavior

#### People of low SES are just as likely to make quit attempts but are less
likely to quit smoking cigarettes than those who are not.3

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * An estimated 66.6% of adult current daily cigarette smokers living below the poverty level attempt to quit smoking cigarettes compared with 69.9% of those living at or above the poverty level.3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * An estimated 39.0% of adult current daily cigarette smokers with no high school diploma attempt to quit smoking compared with 44.0% of those with some college education.3

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Targeting

#### Tobacco companies often target their advertising campaigns toward low-
income neighborhoods and communities.3

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Researchers have found a higher density of tobacco retailers in low-income neighborhoods.12
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Tobacco companies have historically targeted women of low SES through distribution of discount coupons, point-of-sale discounts, direct-mail coupons, and development of brands that appeal to these women.13

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among people of low SES
status.
