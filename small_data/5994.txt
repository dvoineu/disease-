**Summary**

**What is already known on this topic?**

More than 54 million US adults report having arthritis, and more than 15
million US adults report having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

**What is added by this report?**

Adults with arthritis are more likely than adults without arthritis to have a
higher prevalence of COPD (13.7% vs 3.8%). The relationships remained
significant among all subgroups of selected characteristics after we
controlled for covariates.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Assessment of COPD and arthritis symptoms by health care providers may enhance
earlier detection of each condition. Evidence-based self-management programs
may ameliorate symptoms.

## Abstract

**Introduction**

More than 54 million US adults have arthritis, and more than 15 million US
adults have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease **(** COPD). Arthritis and
COPD share many risk factors, such as tobacco use, asthma history, and age.
The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between self-
reported physician-diagnosed COPD and arthritis in the US adult population.

**Methods**

We analyzed data from 408,774 respondents aged 18 or older in the 2016
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to assess the association between
self-reported physician-diagnosed COPD and arthritis in the US adult
population by using multivariable logistic regression analyses.

**Results**

Overall crude prevalence was 6.4% for COPD and 25.2% for arthritis. The
prevalence of age-adjusted COPD was higher among respondents with arthritis
than among respondents without arthritis (13.7% vs 3.8%, _P_ < .001). The
association remained significant among most subgroups ( _P_ < .001)
particularly among adults aged 18 to 44 (11.5% vs 2.0%) and never smokers
(7.6% vs 1.7%). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, arthritis
status was significantly associated with COPD status after controlling for
sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and health-related quality
of life measures (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval,
1.4-1.5, _P_ < .001).

**Conclusion**

Our results confirmed that arthritis is associated with a higher prevalence of
COPD in the US adult population. Health care providers may assess COPD and
arthritis symptoms for earlier detection of each condition and recommend that
patients with COPD and/or arthritis participate in pulmonary rehabilitation
and self-management education programs such as the Chronic Disease Self-
Management Program, the proven benefits of which include increased aerobic
activity and reduced shortness of breath, pain, and depression.

## Introduction

More than 15 million US adults have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
**(** COPD), and more than 54 million US adults have arthritis (1,2). COPD is
characterized by progressive, irreversible airflow limitation and was the
fourth leading cause of death in the United States in 2016 (3). Arthritis is a
common chronic condition and a leading cause of disability (4). Data from
cross-sectional studies suggest that adults with COPD are more likely than
adults without COPD to have arthritis (5), including osteoarthritis (6) and
rheumatoid arthritis (7). Emerging evidence from longitudinal studies also
shows a higher risk of developing COPD among adults with arthritis than adults
without arthritis at baseline (8-11). COPD and arthritis share many of the
same risk factors, such as sex, age, lower socioeconomic status, tobacco use,
obesity, and infection (12-14). Most previous studies assessed the COPD-
arthritis relationship by controlling for those common risk factors (9-11).
However, few studies, including nationally representative studies, examined
the relationship among subgroups with or without those risk factors (5,11).
Describing these relationships may inform health care providers to assess COPD
and arthritis symptoms for earlier detection of these conditions and provide
new insights into preventing them.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between self-
reported physician-diagnosed COPD and arthritis in the US adult population
aged 18 or older in the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). We examined the relationship among subgroups with and without the
common risk factors.

## Methods

The BRFSS is a random-digital-dialed landline and cellular telephone survey
that is conducted by state health departments in collaboration with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, and US territories (www.cdc.gov/brfss). The BRFSS
collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors,
chronic diseases, and other conditions among the adult population (aged ≥18)
in 2016. Disproportionate stratified sampling of respondents defined by
race/ethnicity, sex, or age may vary between states. CDC weighted each sample
using design weighting and "raking" weighting methods to obtain a study
population representative of each state. Trained interviewers administered
standardized questionnaires to all adult respondents. All respondents provided
an oral consent statement for participating in the survey. The study was
approved as exempt research by CDC's institutional review board.

### Measures

Respondents who answered yes to the question of whether they had ever been
told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that they had "chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or chronic bronchitis" or
arthritis ("some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or
fibromyalgia") were determined to have those conditions. Asthma status, a
covariable in this study, was based on questions about whether respondents had
ever been told they had asthma and "still have asthma." We categorized
responses as current asthma, history of asthma only, or no asthma.

Other covariates were age groups (18-44, 45-64, 65-74, and ≥75 y), sex,
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, American
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, and non-Hispanic other), education levels (<high
school diploma, high school diploma or GED, some college, and college
graduate), and employment status (employed, unemployed, retired, unable to
work, and other). Sleep duration was defined according to a response to the
question, "On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour
period?" We defined short sleep duration as fewer than 7 hours of sleep (15).
The number of physically unhealthy days was determined according to the
question, "Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical
illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your
physical health not good?" The number of mentally unhealthy days was
determined according to the question, "Now thinking about your mental health,
which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many
days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?" Consistent with
previous research (16), frequent physical distress was defined as 14 or more
physically unhealthy days, and frequent mental distress was defined as 14 or
more mentally unhealthy days. Any leisure-time physical activity was defined
according to a yes response to a single question, "During the past month,
other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or
exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for
exercise?" Smoking status was defined by 2 questions: "Have you smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?" and "Do you currently smoke every
day, some days, or not at all?" Respondents were current smokers if they
reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and
currently smoked every day or some days. Former smokers were defined as
respondents who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their
lifetime but did not currently smoke. Never smokers were defined as
respondents who reported not having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during
their lifetime. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated from self-reported
height and weight and categorized as underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight
(BMI = 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI = 25.0-29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30.0).
Excessive alcohol drinkers were defined as respondents who had any alcohol
drinks and were younger than 21, women who were pregnant and reported drinking
any alcohol in the previous month, or respondents who were binge drinkers (≥5
drinks for men on an occasion and ≥4 drinks for women on an occasion) or heavy
drinkers (≥15 drinks per week for men and ≥8 drinks per week for women during
the past 30 days) (17).

In 2016, 486,303 respondents aged 18 or older residing in 50 states,
Washington, DC, and the US territories participated in the survey. The median
response rate was 47.1% (range, 30.7% in Louisiana to 65.0% in Wyoming) (18).
After we excluded respondents with missing values (age [n = 6,697], COPD [n =
156], arthritis [n = 99], or risk behaviors and health-related quality of life
[n = 70,577]), we analyzed complete data for 408,774 adult respondents.

### Statistical analysis

We calculated the age-adjusted prevalence of COPD and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) by standardizing to the 2000 projected US population in 5 age groups
(18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-64, and ≥ 65) by arthritis status and selected
characteristics (19). We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses
to assess the association of COPD with arthritis after controlling for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, education levels, employment status, short sleep
duration, frequent mental distress, frequent physical distress, smoking
status, BMI category, leisure-time physical activity, excessive alcohol
drinking, and asthma status. We conducted all analyses in SAS-callable SUDAAN
version 11.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute) to account for the complex
sampling design. We determined significant differences at _P_ < .05.

## Results

Respondents with arthritis were more likely than respondents without arthritis
to be women, aged 45 or older, non-Hispanic white, and not a college graduate,
to be retired or unable to work, to have frequent mental or physical distress,
to be former or current smokers, to have short sleep duration, to be obese,
and to have current asthma or a history of COPD. Respondents with arthritis
were less likely than respondents without arthritis to report excessive
alcohol drinking or leisure-time physical activity ( _P_ < .001) (Table 1).

The crude prevalence of COPD and arthritis was 6.4% and 25.2%, respectively,
among US adults in 2016. Respondents with arthritis had a higher age-adjusted
COPD prevalence than respondents without arthritis overall (13.7% vs 3.8%, _P_
< .001) (Table 2). In subgroup analyses, we observed a higher prevalence of
COPD and arthritis with increasing age (Figure 1).

The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was higher among respondents with
arthritis than among respondents without arthritis, regardless of sex, age
group, education level, employment status, frequent mental distress, frequent
physical distress, leisure-time physical activity, smoking status, short sleep
duration, BMI category, excessive alcohol drinking, and asthma status ( _P_ <
.001) (Table 2). The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was higher among
respondents with arthritis than among respondents without arthritis in most
racial/ethnic groups ( _P_ < .001). Although the prevalence of COPD was low in
some subgroups (eg, younger adults, college graduates, and respondents who
never smoked), respondents with arthritis were significantly more likely than
respondents without arthritis to report COPD in these subgroups. For example,
among adults aged 18 to 44, the age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was 11.5% for
respondents with arthritis and 2.0% for respondents without arthritis (Figure
2).

Among never smokers, the prevalence of COPD was 7.6% for respondents with
arthritis and 1.7% for respondents without arthritis (Figure 3).

In multivariable logistic regression analyses, arthritis was significantly
associated with COPD, after controlling for sociodemographics, risk behaviors,
frequent mental distress, frequent physical distress, and asthma status
(adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.4-1.5; _P_ <
.001) (Table 2). The association remained statistically significant among most
subgroups by selected characteristics, including adults aged 18 to 44 and
nonsmokers.

## Discussion

Our study demonstrated that the prevalence of COPD was almost 50% higher among
adults with arthritis than among adults without arthritis in the United States
after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviors,
frequent mental distress, frequent physical distress, and asthma status.
Additionally, the relationship between COPD and arthritis was evident in
essentially all subgroups of sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviors,
frequent mental distress, frequent physical distress, and a history of asthma.
Our results, from a large nationwide sample, are consistent with the results
of previous hospitalization and clinical studies of the association between
COPD and osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (5-11). Those previous studies
showed only the association between COPD and arthritis in sex and age groups
(5,7,8,10,11). Therefore, our results add epidemiological information to the
existing literature.

The reason for a positive association between COPD and arthritis is not clear.
First, prolonged systemic inflammation may mediate the relationship between
arthritis and COPD (8). Second, smoking is a common risk factor for both
arthritis and COPD, and it may exacerbate the 2 underlying conditions (20,21).
Therefore, smoking cessation is important to preventing and managing arthritis
and COPD. Third, stiff joints and joint pain, weak muscles, and poor balance
are common symptoms of arthritis. These symptoms can limit a person's physical
activity and further impair respiratory function in people who also have COPD.
Conversely, dyspnea or shortness of breath are common symptoms of COPD and can
make arthritis worse if patients become more sedentary (22). Therefore,
physical inactivity may contribute to the relationship between COPD and
arthritis. However, aerobic activity could reduce symptoms of both COPD and
arthritis (22,23). Therefore, aerobic physical activity interventions or
pulmonary rehabilitation may improve long-term health outcomes for patients
with COPD and/or arthritis (22,23). Finally, follow-up care and treatment of
one condition may lead health care providers to detect and diagnose comorbid
conditions.

Our study showed that the greater prevalence of COPD among adults with
arthritis than among adults without arthritis remained significant among all
subgroups by selected characteristics in multivariable logistic regression
models including sociodemographics, risk behaviors, frequent mental distress,
frequent physical distress, and asthma status. It also demonstrated that the
relationship between COPD and arthritis was not only among people with common
risk factors but also among younger adults and among nonsmokers. Our findings
imply that assessment of COPD and arthritis symptoms by a primary care
physician might be advised for persons with arthritis or COPD.

Health care providers may also consider referring their patients to evidence-
based self-management education programs, such as the Chronic Disease Self-
Management Program (CDSMP), which were developed to help people with chronic
diseases such as COPD and arthritis manage their symptoms and improve their
quality of life (24). A meta-analysis showed that people participating in
CDSMP experienced numerous benefits, including reduced shortness of breath,
pain, and depression and increased aerobic activity (25).

Our study had several limitations. First, because BRFSS is a cross-sectional
survey, we cannot make causal inferences. Second, arthritis was defined as a
broad category that included rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, fibromyalgia,
or any other form of arthritis. There are more than 100 types of arthritis
(26), and our results may not apply to all types. Further research on
associations between COPD and various types of arthritis may reveal more
insights into the relationship. Third, sample selection bias due to low
response rates may have also influenced our results. However, the effect of
potential systematic bias was likely limited because the relationship between
COPD and arthritis in our study is consistent with the relationship described
in previous studies (5,8). Finally, all responses to survey questions in the
study were self-reported; as such, they were subject to recall bias, and this
bias might have affected our results.

Our results confirmed that arthritis was associated with a higher likelihood
of COPD in the US adult population. Health care providers may assess COPD and
arthritis symptoms for earlier detection and recommend to their patients with
COPD and/or arthritis to participate in evidence-based self-management
education programs such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program to
manage their symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, and depression,
and improve their quality of life.
