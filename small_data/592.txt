to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, from multiple
hatcheries.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and
foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Contact with live poultry
(chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings) in the week before becoming ill was
reported by 552 of 745 ill people interviewed, or 74%.

Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several suppliers,
including feed supply stores, Internet sites, hatcheries, and friends in
multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to produce eggs,
learn about agriculture, have as a hobby, enjoy for fun, keep as pets, or to
give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported contact with live
poultry included their home, someone else's home, work, or school settings.

Public health officials collected samples from live poultry and the
environments where the poultry live and roam from the homes of ill people in
several states or at locations of purchase in several states. Laboratory
testing isolated five of the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_.

(82%) reported contact with live poultry.

### Previous Updates

July 19, 2016

#### Outbreak Summary Update

Since the last update on June 2, 2016, one more outbreak was identified,
bringing the total to eight outbreaks under investigation. Another 287 ill
people have been reported from 45 states for these eight outbreaks.

As of July 14, 2016, 611 people infected with the outbreak strains of
_Salmonella_ have been reported from 45 states. A list of states and the
number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page.

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates
ranging from January 4, 2016 to June 25, 2016. Ill people range in age from
less than 1 year to 93, with a median age of 20. Of ill people, 52% are
female. Among 496 ill people with available information, 138 (28%) reported
being hospitalized, and one death was reported. _Salmonella_ was not
considered to be a cause of death.

Illnesses that started after June 16, 2016 might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

#### Investigation Update

Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings have linked the eight
outbreaks to contact with live poultry such as chicks and ducklings from
multiple hatcheries.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and
foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Contact with live poultry
(chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings) in the week before becoming ill was
reported by 434 of 493 ill people interviewed, or 88%.

Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several suppliers,
including feed supply stores, Internet sites, hatcheries, and friends in
multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to produce eggs,
learn about agriculture, have as a hobby, enjoy for fun, keep as pets, or to
give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported contact with live
poultry include their home, someone else's home, work, or school settings.

Public health officials collected samples from live poultry and the
environments where the poultry live and roam from the homes of ill people in
several states. Laboratory testing isolated four of the outbreak strains of
_Salmonella_.

More information about each outbreak is available in the outbreak summaries
below.

Initial Announcement

#### Introduction

CDC is collaborating with public health, veterinary, and agriculture officials
in many states, as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), to investigate seven separate
multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections. Results from these
investigations showed that contact with live poultry in backyard flocks was
the likely source of these outbreaks.

Contact with live poultry (such as chicks, chickens, ducks, and ducklings) and
their environment can make people sick with _Salmonella_ infections.
Regardless of where they are purchased, live poultry may have _Salmonella_
germs in their droppings and on their bodies (feathers, feet, and beaks) even
when they appear healthy and clean. The germs can also get on cages, coops,
hay, plants, and soil in the area where the birds live and roam. People,
especially children, can be exposed to _Salmonella_ by holding, cuddling, or
kissing the birds and by touching things where the bird lives, such as cages
or feed and water bowls.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify
illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC,
is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency
laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on _Salmonella_ bacteria
isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages
a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.

#### Investigation of the Outbreaks

In seven separate multistate outbreaks, a total of 324 people infected with
the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ were reported from 35 states. Among
people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses started on dates
ranging from January 4, 2016 to May 11, 2016. A list of the states and the
number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and
other exposures in the week before becoming ill; 217 (91%) of the 238 people
interviewed reported contact with live poultry in the week before their
illness. Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several
different suppliers, including feed supply stores, Co-Ops, hatcheries, and
friends in multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to
produce eggs, learn about agriculture, have as a hobby,enjoy for fun, keep as
pets, or to give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported
contact with live poultry include at their home, someone else's home, work, or
school settings.

The CDC National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) human
surveillance program monitors antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ and other
bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health
laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antibiotic-resistance testing
on clinical isolates collected from three people infected with one of the
seven outbreak strains. All three isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics
tested. CDC's NARMS laboratory continues to conduct antibiotic-resistance
testing on additional clinical isolates collected from ill persons infected
with one of the outbreak strains. Results will be reported when they become
available.

NARMS is a U.S. public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic
resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat
and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), and state and local health departments.
