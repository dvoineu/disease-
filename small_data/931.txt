Closing to Clean or Disinfect

In general, it is not necessary to close entire facilities to "disinfect" them
when MRSA infections occur. Routine cleaning practices are enough in most
situations. MRSA skin infections are transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin
contact and by contact with surfaces that have come into contact with someone
else's infection. Spread can be prevented by simple measures such as hand
hygiene and covering wounds.

Notifications

Usually, it is not be necessary to inform the entire school community about a
single MRSA infection.

If a MRSA infection occurs in the school:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Most schools require that any communicable disease be reported to the student's teacher or administration. Consult with your school about its policy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The school healthcare provider should determine whether some or all students, parents, and staff should be notified.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * If medical personnel are not available at the school, consult with the local public health authorities to guide this decision.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Repeat cases, spread to other students, or complex cases should be reported to the health department for consultation.

Excluding Students with MRSA Infections from School

Students with MRSA infections can attend school unless a healthcare provider
tells them not to. But they should _not_ attend school if:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * There is wound drainage ("pus") that cannot be covered and contained with a clean, dry bandage.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * They cannot maintain good personal hygiene.

School health personnel should notify parents/guardians when possible skin infections are detected.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene before and after contact, wearing gloves) when caring for broken skin (open wounds) or potential infections.
