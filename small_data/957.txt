Some people also had diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. For many people with MERS,
more severe complications followed, such as pneumonia and kidney failure.
About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people reported with MERS have died. Most of the
people who died had a pre-existing medical condition that weakened their
immune system, or an underlying medical condition that hadn't yet been
discovered. Medical conditions sometimes weaken people's immune systems and
make them more likely to get sick or have severe illness.

Some infected people had mild symptoms (such as cold-like symptoms) or no
symptoms at all.

The symptoms of MERS start to appear about 5 or 6 days after a person is
exposed, but can range from 2 to 14 days.
