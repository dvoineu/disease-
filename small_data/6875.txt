Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable
encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. For most travelers to Asia, the
risk for JE is very low but varies based on destination, length of travel,
season, and activities.  Most people infected with JE do not have symptoms or
have only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected people
develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), with symptoms including
sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors and
convulsions. About 1 in 4 cases are fatal. To prevent getting sick from JE,
use an EPA-registered insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long
pants, and get vaccinated.
