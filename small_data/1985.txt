CDC has a fun way of teaching about emergency preparedness. Our graphic novel,
"Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic" demonstrates the importance of being
prepared in an entertaining way that people of all ages will enjoy. Readers
follow Todd, Julie, and their dog Max as a strange new disease begins
spreading, turning ordinary people into zombies. Stick around to the end for a
surprising twist that will drive home the importance of being prepared for any
emergency. Included in the novel is a Preparedness Checklist so that readers
can get their family, workplace, or school ready before disaster strikes.
