## A National Strategy for the Elimination of Hepatitis B and C

In the face of recent developments in hepatitis C treatment, enhanced global
solidarity for hepatitis B and hepatitis C elimination goals, and progress
implementing The National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (2017-2020) Cdc-pdf[PDF
- 84 pages]External, an ambitious strategy to set and achieve HBV and HCV
elimination goals in the United States is needed. In 2015, the Division of
Viral Hepatitis (DVH) within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
commissioned the National Academy of Medicine of the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to convene an expert committee to examine
scientific and policy issues related to the prevention, detection, control,
and management of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. DVH and its co-sponsors tasked
the National Academies to determine whether elimination goal(s) are feasible
for hepatitis C incidence, hepatitis C mortality, hepatitis B incidence, and
hepatitis B mortality; and, if so, what the goals and plan of action to
achieve the elimination goals should specify. The National Academies' efforts
to develop this strategy were accomplished in the following two phases:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Phase 1: Eliminating the Public Health Problem of Hepatitis B and C in the United States (2016)  
**In partnership with the Office of Minority Health (OMH) in the Office of the
Secretary (OS) of HHS, DVH commissioned The National Academies to determine
whether elimination goals for hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the United States
are feasible and to identify possible critical success factors. The Phase I
report explores the barriers that must be overcome to eliminate hepatitis B
and hepatitis C in the United States - and reaffirms that hepatitis
elimination can be achieved with the right resources, commitment, and
strategy.

In Phase 2, DVH and its co-sponsors: the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable
(NVHR), OMH, the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control (DCPC) within CDC,
the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), and the
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), commissioned the National
Academies to develop a consensus report that includes specific recommendations

## Hepatitis and Liver Cancer: A National Strategy for Prevention and Control
of Hepatitis B and C (2010)

![Cover of IOM report](/hepatitis/images/pictures/IOM-ReportCover.jpg)

CDC, along with other partners, commissioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
to examine the prevention and control of viral hepatitis infections in the
United States. The IOM issued three report briefs - Report Brief for State and
Local Health Departments, Report Brief for Health Care Providers and Report
Brief about Harm Reduction, all available in the "Report at a GlanceExternal"
section.

The committee identified the underlying factors that impede current efforts to
prevent and control these diseases. Three major factors were found:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * There is a lack of knowledge and awareness about chronic viral hepatitis on the part of the health-care and social-service providers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * There is a lack of knowledge and awareness about chronic viral hepatitis among at-risk populations, members of the public and policy-makers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * There is insufficient understanding about the extent and seriousness of the public health problem, so inadequate public resources are being allocated to prevention, control and surveillance programs
