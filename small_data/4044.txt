### BRFSS Core Questionnaire

In each area where interviews are conducted, respondents are randomly selected
from noninstitutionalized civilian adults (18 years of age or older) living in
households with a telephone (BRFSS User's Guide pdf icon[PDF - 1.7 MB]).
Asthma prevalence data are produced from the responses to two asthma questions
on the 2007 BRFSS Core Questionnaire.

**Lifetime asthma: Question number 9.1**  
"Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that
you had asthma?" (Variable name: ASTHMA2)

The calculated variable _LTASTHMA (based on question 9.1) from the public use
file was used when creating the tables.

**Current asthma: Question number 9.2**  
If the response to 9.1 was "Yes," then question 9.2 was asked: "Do you still
have asthma?" (Variable name: ASTHNOW)

Adult module tables include only respondents who answered "yes" to both the
lifetime and the current asthma question.

Module tables are based on data from the following questions:

### Survey Design and Sample Weights

The survey design is described in the technical pages document for each year,
for example, "2007 Overview" at
http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/technical_infodata/surveydata/2007.htm. Sample
weights are assigned, according to BRFSS methodology, to the variable _FINALWT
as described in the BRFSS Weighting Formula.

### Data Analysis

**Data Used:**

The BRFSS Survey Datapdf icon files for 2002 to 2007 were used to calculate
estimates for states that included the adult asthma module in their BRFSS
survey. States for each year are indicated below:

BRFSS Survey Data Table Year | States | No.  
---|---|---  
2002 | California, Delaware, DC, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Virgin Islands | 19  
2003 | Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin | 19  
2004 | Alaska, Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Texas, Utah,
Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin | 26  
2005 | Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,
Iowa, Maine, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin | 22  
2006 | Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Utah, West
Virginia | 14  
2007 | Arizona, Colorado*, Idaho, Mississippi, New Jersey* , North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Virginia | 10  
  
* Used a Dual Questionnaire (split sample).

**Software:**

Percent and standard error estimates were calculated using the SAS 9.1 PROC
SURVEYFREQ procedure to account for survey data from complex sample designs.
The BRFSS employs a complex stratified sample design. Therefore, an analysis
that ignored the complex design clustering and stratification and the sample
weights (for example the SAS PROC FREQ procedure) would result in biased
estimators.

**Data Management:**

Only respondents with values of the variables as described in the table above
are included in each table. Responses of "don't know/not sure," "refused," or
missing values were excluded.

In the original data sets, those respondents answering "Not at any time" to
the question "days of asthma symptoms in the past 30 days" had missing values
in the question "days of sleep disturbance in the past 30 days" because of a
skip pattern in the interview sequence. Therefore, those answering "Not at any
time" to the question days of asthma symptoms in 30 days were recoded to
"None" for the question "days of sleep disturbance in the past 30 days."

For "days of activity limitation in 12 months," the respondents with a
response code of "88" days were excluded. Previous investigations indicated
that an "88"represented a coding error resulting from the numerical similarity
with the code for no days (888).

In the 2005 data, Delaware data included an unusually large percentage of
"Don't Know/Not Sure" for the questions "age of asthma onset" and "use of
rescue inhaler in 30 days." After BRFSS staff in Delaware was consulted, the
data were revised to correct a coding error.

Sample weights for states implementing split sample designs have been adjusted
to account for the use of dual questionnaires (Colorado and New Jersey in
2007).

**Table Conventions:**

The first table in each file is a summary table with data from all the states
that implemented the adult module. It excludes any U.S. territories that
implemented the module. Individual tables for each state and each territory
that conducted the adult module follow the summary table.

The tables examine interrelationships between multiple asthma-control
indicators (rows) and a primary variable (columns). For the years 2002 to
2004, separate tables are provided for three primary variables (Sex, Age at
Diagnosis, and Medication Status). Each table includes the following
indicators: Age at Diagnosis (if not the primary variable), Medication Status
(if not the primary variable), Attack, Emergency Department Visits, Urgent
Doctor Visits, Routine Doctor Visits, Activity Limitations, Days with
Symptoms, and Days with Sleep Disturbance. Beginning with 2005, tables are
provided for five primary variables (Sex, Age at Diagnosis, Medication Status,
Rescue Inhaler, and Preventive Medication). Each primary variable table
includes the following indicators: Age at Diagnosis (if not the primary
variable), Preventive Medication (if not the primary variable), Rescue Inhaler
(if not the primary variable), Attack, Emergency Department Visits, Urgent
Doctor Visits, Routine Doctor Visits, Activity Limitations, Days with
Symptoms, and Days with Sleep Disturbance.

The relationship between each indicator variable (rows) and the three primary
categorical variables (2002-2004) or the five primary categorical variables
(2005 and later) were examined. Indicator variables were categorized in two
different ways. First, each indicator was dichotomized to represent any event
or no event (visit, days, attack, medication use). Second, the "Any" category
was grouped into several sub-categories by collapsing question response
categories as shown in the table above.

For each indicator variable for each of the three primary categorical
variables (2002-2004) or five primary categorical variables (years since 2005)
the proportion estimates and variance estimates were calculated. The Wald test
was used to determine if there was a significant relationship between each
indicator variable and the primary categorical variables. Tests were done
separately for the dichotomized version of the indicator and for the multiple
category version of the indicator. The resulting P-values are reported in each
table.

**Small Sample Size**

When sample sizes in cells are less than 50, as they are in some of the
state/territory tables, the standard error may be large relative to the
estimate value, leading to a wide 95% confidence interval. Caution should be
used in interpreting such "imprecise" estimates.
