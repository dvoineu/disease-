# Anogenital Warts

Minus

Of anogenital warts, 90% are caused by nononcogenic HPV types 6 or 11; these
types can be commonly identified before or at the same time anogenital warts
are detected ( _767_ ). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 are also occasionally
found in anogenital warts (usually as co-infections with HPV 6 or 11) and can
be associated with foci of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL),
particularly in persons who have HIV infection. In addition to anogenital
warts, HPV types 6 and 11 have been associated with conjunctival, nasal, oral,
and laryngeal warts.

Anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic, but depending on the size and
anatomic location, they can be painful or pruritic. They are usually flat,
papular, or pedunculated growths on the genital mucosa. Anogenital warts occur
commonly at certain anatomic sites, including around the vaginal introitus,
under the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and on the shaft of the
circumcised penis. Warts can also occur at multiple sites in the anogenital
epithelium or within the anogenital tract (e.g., cervix, vagina, urethra,
perineum, perianal skin, anus, and scrotum). Intra-anal warts are observed
predominantly in persons who have had receptive anal intercourse, but they
also can occur in men and women who have not had a history of anal sexual
contact.

### Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection. The
diagnosis of anogenital warts can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated
if lesions are atypical (e.g., pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying
tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated in the
following circumstances, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised
(including those infected with HIV): 1) the diagnosis is uncertain; 2) the
lesions do not respond to standard therapy; or 3) the disease worsens during
therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis, because
test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management.

### Treatment

The aim of treatment is removal of the wart and amelioration of symptoms, if
present. The appearance of warts also can result in significant psychosocial
distress, and removal can relieve cosmetic concerns. In most patients,
treatment results in resolution of the wart(s). If left untreated, anogenital
warts can resolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or
number. Because warts might spontaneously resolve within 1 year, an acceptable
alternative for some persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous
resolution. Available therapies for anogenital warts might reduce, but
probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether the reduction in HPV viral
DNA resulting from treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.

#### Recommended Regimens

Treatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, number, and
anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; convenience; adverse
effects; and provider experience. No definitive evidence suggests that any one
recommended treatment is superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal
for all patients or all warts. The use of locally developed and monitored
treatment algorithms has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and
should be encouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, some
clinicians employ combination therapy (e.g., provider-administered cryotherapy
with patient-applied topical therapy between visits to the provider). However,
limited data exist regarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated
with combination therapy. Treatment regimens are classified as either patient-
applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-applied modalities are
preferred by some persons because they can be administered in the privacy of
their home. To ensure that patient-applied modalities are effective,
instructions should be provided to patients while in the clinic, and all
anogenital warts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit.
Follow-up visits after several weeks of therapy enable providers to answer any
questions about the use of the medication and address any side effects
experienced; follow-up visits also facilitate the assessment of the response
to treatment.

Imiquimod is a patient-applied, topically active immune enhancer that
stimulates production of interferon and other cytokines. Imiquimod 5% cream
should be applied once at bedtime, three times a week for up to 16 weeks (
_768_ ). Similarly, imiquimod 3.75% cream should be applied once at bedtime,
but is applied every night ( _769_ ). With either formulation, the treatment
area should be washed with soap and water 6-10 hours after the application.
Local inflammatory reactions, including redness, irritation, induration,
ulceration/erosions, and vesicles might occur with the use of imiquimod, and
hypopigmentation has also been described ( _770_ ). A small number of case
reports demonstrate an association between treatment with imiquimod cream and
worsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., psoriasis, vitiligo,
and lichenoid dermatoses) ( _771-773_ ). Data from studies of human subjects
are limited regarding use of imiquimod in pregnancy, but animal data suggest
that this therapy poses low risk ( _317_ ).

Podofilox (podophyllotoxin) is a patient-applied antimitotic drug that causes
wart necrosis. Podofilox solution (using a cotton swab) or podofilox gel
(using a finger) should be applied to anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days,
followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary,
for up to four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed 10 cm2,
and the total volume of podofilox should be limited to 0.5 mL per day. If
possible, the health-care provider should apply the initial treatment to
demonstrate proper application technique and identify which warts should be
treated. Mild to moderate pain or local irritation might develop after
treatment. Podofilox is contraindicated in pregnancy ( _317_ ).

Sinecatechins is a patient-applied, green-tea extract with an active product
(catechins). Sinecatechins 15% ointment should be applied three times daily
(0.5 cm strand of ointment to each wart) using a finger to ensure coverage
with a thin layer of ointment until complete clearance of warts is achieved.
This product should not be continued for longer than 16 weeks ( _774-776_ ).
The medication should not be washed off after use. Genital, anal, and oral
sexual contact should be avoided while the ointment is on the skin. The most
common side effects of sinecatechins are erythema, pruritus/burning, pain,
ulceration, edema, induration, and vesicular rash. The medication is not
recommended for persons with HIV infection, other immunocompromised
conditions, or with genital herpes because the safety and efficacy of therapy
has not been evaluated. The safety of sinecatechins during pregnancy is
unknown.

Cryotherapy is a provider-applied therapy that destroys warts by thermal-
induced cytolysis. Health-care providers must be trained on the proper use of
this therapy because over- and under-treatment can result in complications or
low efficacy. Pain during and after application of the liquid nitrogen,
followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering, is common. Local anesthesia
(topical or injected) might facilitate therapy if warts are present in many
areas or if the area of warts is large.

Surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating most warts at a single
visit, although recurrence can occur. Surgical removal requires substantial
clinical training, additional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit.
After local anesthesia is applied, anogenital warts can be physically
destroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional hemostasis is
required. Care must be taken to control the depth of electrocautery to prevent
scarring. Alternatively, the warts can be removed either by tangential
excision with a pair of fine scissors or a scalpel, by carbon dioxide (CO2)
laser, or by curettage. Because most warts are exophytic, this procedure can
be accomplished with a resulting wound that only extends into the upper
dermis. Hemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in cases of
very minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum chloride solution).
Suturing is neither required nor indicated in most cases. In patients with
large or extensive warts, surgical therapy, including CO2 laser, might be most
beneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral warts,
particularly for those persons who have not responded to other treatments.
Treatment of anogenital and oral warts should be performed in an appropriately
ventilated room using standard precautions
(https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf#page=2Cdc-pdf) and
local exhaust ventilation (e.g., a smoke evacuator) ( _777_ )
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/hazardcontrol/hc11.html).

Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) are provider-applied
caustic agents that destroy warts by chemical coagulation of proteins.
Although these preparations are widely used, they have not been investigated
thoroughly. TCA solution has a low viscosity comparable with that of water and
can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if applied excessively. A small
amount should be applied only to the warts and allowed to dry (i.e., develop
white frost on tissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense
or an excess amount of acid is applied, the area can be covered with sodium
bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), washed with liquid soap preparations, or be
powdered with talc to neutralize the acid or remove unreacted acid. TCA/BCA
treatment can be repeated weekly if necessary.

#### Alternative Regimens for External Genital Warts

Less data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative regimens for
treating anogenital warts, which include podophyllin resin, intralesional
interferon, photodynamic therapy, and topical cidofovir. Further, alternative
regimens might be associated with more side effects. Podopyllin resin is no
longer a recommended regimen because of the number of safer regimens
available, and severe systemic toxicity has been reported when podophyllin
resin was applied to large areas of friable tissue and was not washed off
within 4 hours ( _778-780_ ). Podophyllin resin 10%-25% in a compound tincture
of benzoin might be considered for provider-administered treatment under
conditions of strict adherence to recommendations. Podophyllin should be
applied to each wart and then allowed to air-dry before the treated area comes
into contact with clothing. Over-application or failure to air-dry can result
in local irritation caused by spread of the compound to adjacent areas and
possible systemic toxicity. The treatment can be repeated weekly, if
necessary. To avoid the possibility of complications associated with systemic
absorption and toxicity, 1) application should be limited to <0.5 mL of
podophyllin or an area of <10 cm2 of warts per session; 2) the area to which
treatment is administered should not contain any open lesions, wounds, or
friable tissue; and 3) the preparation should be thoroughly washed off 1-4
hours after application. Podophyllin resin preparations differ in the
concentration of active components and contaminants. Shelf-life and stability
of podophyllin preparations are unknown. The safety of podophyllin during
pregnancy has not been established.

Management of intra-anal warts should include consultation with a specialist.

### Follow-Up

Most anogenital warts respond within 3 months of therapy. Factors that might
affect response to therapy include immunosuppression and treatment compliance.
In general, warts located on moist surfaces or in intertriginous areas respond
best to topical treatment. A new treatment modality should be selected when no
substantial improvement is observed after a complete course of treatment or in
the event of severe side effects; treatment response and therapy-associated
side effects should be evaluated throughout the course of therapy.
Complications occur rarely when treatment is administered properly. Persistent
hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation can occur with ablative modalities
(e.g., cryotherapy and electrocautery) and have been described with immune
modulating therapies (e.g., imiquimod cream). Depressed or hypertrophic scars
are uncommon but can occur, especially if patients have insufficient time to
heal between treatments. Rarely, treatment can result in chronic pain
syndromes (e.g., vulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in
the case of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.

Genital warts can develop months or years after getting HPV. HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to another person even in the absence of visible signs of warts. Sex partners tend to share HPV, even though signs of HPV (e.g., warts) might occur in only one partner or in neither partner.

Sexual activity should be avoided with new partners until the warts are gone or removed. HPV might remain present and can still be transmitted to partners even after the warts are gone.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent genital warts (Gardasil), but it will not treat existing HPV or genital warts. This vaccine can prevent most cases of genital warts in persons who have not yet been exposed to wart-causing types of HPV.

### Management of Sex Partners

Persons should inform current partner(s) about having genital warts because
the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed on to partners. Partners
should receive counseling messages that partners might already have HPV
despite no visible signs of warts, so HPV testing of sex partners of persons
with genital warts is not recommended. Partner(s) might benefit from a
physical examination to detect genital warts and tests for other STDs. No
recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex partners about a
diagnosis of genital warts because the duration of viral persistence after
warts have resolved is unknown.

###  Special Considerations

#### Pregnancy

Podofilox (podophyllotoxin), podophyllin, and sinecatechins should not be used
during pregnancy. Imiquimod appears to pose low risk but should be avoided
until more data are available. Anogenital warts can proliferate and become
friable during pregnancy. Although removal of warts during pregnancy can be
considered, resolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is
complete. Rarely, HPV types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory papillomatosis in
infants and children, although the route of transmission (i.e.,
transplacental, perinatal, or postnatal) is not completely understood. Whether
cesarean section prevents respiratory papillomatosis in infants and children
also is unclear _(781)_; therefore, cesarean delivery should not be performed
solely to prevent transmission of HPV infection to the newborn. Cesarean
delivery is indicated for women with anogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is
obstructed or if vaginal delivery would result in excessive bleeding. Pregnant
women with anogenital warts should be counseled concerning the low risk for
warts on the larynx of their infants or children (recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis).

####  HIV Infection and Other Causes of Immunosuppression

Persons with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunosuppressed are more
likely to develop anogenital warts than those who do not have HIV infection (
_782_ ). Moreover, such persons can have larger or more numerous lesions,
might not respond to therapy as well as those who are immunocompetent, and
might have more frequent recurrences after treatment ( _782-785_ ). Despite
these factors, data do not support altered approaches to treatment for persons
with HIV infection. Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or resembling
anogenital warts might occur more frequently among immunosuppressed persons,
therefore requiring biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases
( _786-788_ ).

#### High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL)

Biopsy of an atypical wart might reveal HSIL or cancer of the anogenital
tract. In this instance, referral to a specialist for treatment is
recommended.
