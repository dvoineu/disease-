In 1918, a new influenza virus emerged. During this same time period World War
I was taking place. The conditions of World War I (overcrowding and global
troop movement) helped the 1918 flu spread. The vulnerability of healthy young
adults and the lack of vaccines and treatments created a major public health
crisis, causing at least 50 million deaths worldwide, including approximately
675,000 in the United States. Below is a historical timeline of major events
that took place during this time period.
