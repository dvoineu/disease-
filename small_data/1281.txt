Parvovirus B19 infects only humans. It most commonly causes fifth disease, a
mild rash illness that usually affects children. But it can cause different
signs and symptoms, depending on your age and overall health. Many people
infected with parvovirus B19 do not have any symptoms, or they have only mild,
nonspecific rash illness, not unlike the common cold.
