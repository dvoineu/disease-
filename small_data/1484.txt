Publications (starting with most recent)

Update: Characteristics of a Nationwide Outbreak of E-cigarette, or Vaping,
Product Use-Associated Lung Injury -- United States, August 2019-January 2020  
This report updates patient demographic characteristics, self-reported
substance use, and hospitalization dates for EVALI patients reported to CDC by
states, as well as the distribution of emergency department (ED) visits
related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Data show that ED visits related
to e-cigarette, or vaping, products continue to decline, after sharply
increasing in August 2019 and peaking in September.

Characteristics of Persons Who Report Using Only Nicotine-Containing Products
Among Interviewed Patients with E-cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated
Lung Injury -- Illinois, August-December 2019  
This report examines EVALI patients who report using only nicotine-containing
e-cigarette, or vaping, products in Illinois. Findings suggest that the
contributing cause or causes of EVALI for individuals reporting use of only
nicotine-containing products warrants further study.

Update: Product, Substance-Use, and Demographic Characteristics of
Hospitalized Patients in a Nationwide Outbreak of E-cigarette, or Vaping,
Product Use-Associated Lung Injury -- United States, August 2019-January 2020  
This report updates patient demographic characteristics, self-reported
substance use, and e-cigarette, or vaping, product sources reported to CDC as
of January 7, 2020. Findings strengthen the association between EVALI and the
use of THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from informal
sources.

Update: Interim Guidance for Health Care Professionals Evaluating and Caring
for Patients with Suspected E-cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated
Lung Injury and for Reducing the Risk for Rehospitalization and Death
Following Hospital Discharge -- United States, December 2019  
This guidance document provides updates to prior interim guidance for U.S.
healthcare providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected EVALI,
with particular considerations for discharge planning and optimized follow-up
and case management after discharge.

Characteristics of Patients Experiencing Rehospitalization or Death After
Hospital Discharge in a Nationwide Outbreak of E-cigarette, or Vaping, Product
Use-Associated Lung Injury Lung Injury -- United States, 2019  
This is the first report that analyzes factors that may increase risk for
rehospitalization and death among EVALI patients following hospital discharge.
These findings helped inform updates to clinical guidance for healthcare
professionals.

Vitamin E Acetate in Bronchoalveolar-Lavage Fluid Associated with
EVALIexternal icon  
This study analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from EVALI
cases and a comparison group of healthy people, demonstrating that vitamin E
acetate is closely associated with EVALI.

Syndromic Surveillance for E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated Lung
Injuryexternal icon  
This report analyzed syndromic data on emergency department visits associated
with possible EVALI. Data suggest that the EVALI outbreak began in June 2019
and cases have been declining since a peak in September.

Update: Demographic, Product, and Substance-Use Characteristics of
Hospitalized Patients in a Nationwide Outbreak of E-cigarette, or Vaping,
Product Use-Associated Lung Injuries -- United States, December 2019  
This is the first report that analyzes national data on use of THC-containing
product brands by patients with e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated
lung injury (EVALI).

Characteristics of E-cigarette, or Vaping, Products Used by Patients with
Associated Lung Injury and Products Seized by Law Enforcement -- Minnesota,
2018 and 2019  
This is the first report presenting chemical analytic results on products
obtained from EVALI patients and on products intended for the illicit market
both before and during the outbreak. These data further support a potential
role for vitamin E acetate in the EVALI outbreak.

Update: Interim Guidance for Health Care Providers for Managing Patients with
Suspected E-cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated Lung Injury -- United
States, November 2019  
This guidance document provides updates to prior interim recommendations for
U.S. healthcare providers evaluating and managing patients with suspected or
known lung injury associated with e-cigarette, or vaping, product use, with
particular considerations for outpatient management and for influenza season.
