There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying
to get pregnant. There is also no safe time during pregnancy to drink. All
types of alcohol are equally harmful, including all wines and beer.

FASDs are preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

### Why Alcohol is Dangerous

Alcohol in the mother's blood passes to the baby through the umbilical cord.
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and a
range of lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. These
disabilities are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Children
with FASDs might have the following characteristics and behaviors:

                      * Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip (this ridge is called the philtrum)
                      * Small head size
                      * Shorter-than-average height
                      * Low body weight
                      * Poor coordination
                      * Hyperactive behavior
                      * Difficulty with attention
                      * Poor memory
                      * Difficulty in school (especially with math)
                      * Learning disabilities
                      * Speech and language delays
                      * Intellectual disability or low IQ
                      * Poor reasoning and judgment skills
                      * Sleep and sucking problems as a baby
                      * Vision or hearing problems
                      * Problems with the heart, kidney, or bones

### How Much Alcohol is Dangerous

There is no known safe amount of alcohol to drink while pregnant.

### When Alcohol is Dangerous

There is no safe time to drink alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause
problems for the developing baby throughout pregnancy, including before a
woman knows she is pregnant. Drinking alcohol in the first three months of
pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and
central nervous system problems (e.g., low birthweight, behavioral problems)
can occur from drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy. The baby's brain is
developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at
any time.

If a woman is drinking alcohol during pregnancy, it is never too late to stop.
The sooner a woman stops drinking, the better it will be for both her baby and
herself.
