##### About this chart:

1 **NSCH 2003-2011:** National Survey of Children's Health, telephone survey
data; estimate includes children 4-17 years of age [Read key findings]  
2 **NSCH 2016:** Redesigned as an online and mail surveyexternal icon,
estimate includes children 2-17 years of age [Read key findings _]_

Because the 2016 NSCH survey used different methods, estimates are not
directly comparable with estimates based on previous NSCH data. Because of an
increased focus on ADHD in younger children, age ranges were expanded to
include children 2-17 years of age.

##### Most children with ADHD receive some types of services

A more in-depth national survey2 from 2014 reported on treatment and services
that children with ADHD had received at some point prior to the survey. This
survey was conducted with parents of children 4-17 years of age who had ever
been diagnosed with ADHD.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Almost 9 out of 10 children had received school support, which includes school accommodations and help in the classroom.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * About 6 out of 10 children had received some type of behavioral treatment or skills training: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 3 out of 10 received parent-delivered behavior therapy (/ncbddd/adhd/behavior-therapy.html).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * 2 out of 10 received cognitive behavioral therapy.

##### Healthcare claims data show treatment gaps

In addition to parent-reported data, healthcare claims from Medicaid or
employer-sponsored insurance provide another way to understand treatment
patterns. A study3 looking at the healthcare claims data for young US children
found:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * During 2008-2011, children ages 2-5 years covered by Medicaid were twice as likely to receive clinical care for ADHD compared with similar-aged children covered by commercial employer-sponsored insurance.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * About 3 in 4 children ages 2-5 years who had clinical care for ADHD recorded in their healthcare claims from 2008-2014 received ADHD medication, and fewer than half received any form of psychological services.

It is not known what types of psychological services these children received,
or whether these children received behavioral treatments that were not entered
into the healthcare claims data.
