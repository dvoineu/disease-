# DPDx - Laboratory Identification of Parasitic Diseases of Public Health
Concern

Welcome to DPDx, a website developed and maintained by CDC's Division of
Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM). DPDx uses the Internet to strengthen
diagnosis of parasitic diseases, both in the United States and abroad. This
interactive and rapid exchange of information, allied with already available
diagnostic reference resources, will enhance our capacity to address the
global problem of parasitic diseases.

For that purpose, DPDx offers two complementary functions:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * A Reference and Training function, in which all users can browse through concise reviews of parasites and parasitic diseases, including an image library and a review of recommended procedures for collecting, shipping, processing, and examining biologic specimens.
