Glanders is a disease that usually affects horses, donkeys, and mules. While
the disease still occurs in certain parts of the world, no animal in the
United States has gotten sick with glanders since the 1940s. Though not
common, people have gotten glanders from sick animals. People who are in close
contact with animals that have glanders are more likely to get the disease
than those who are not.

In the past, the germs that cause glanders, the bacteria called _Burkholderia
mallei_ , have been used as a biological weapon during war. It is possible
that these germs could be used again in a biological attack. A biological
attack is the intentional release of germs that can sicken or kill people,
livestock, or crops. Public health authorities study this disease to be
prepared if a biological attack ever happens.
