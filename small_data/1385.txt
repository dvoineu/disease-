Strategy: Offer Behavioral Health Clients Non-Nicotine Tobacco Cessation
Medications

Behavioral health facilities in New York and Oklahoma are national leaders in
providing non-nicotine medications to help persons receiving treatment for
mental or substance use disorders quit using tobacco.

Medicaid pays for mental health treatment for more persons in the U.S. than
any other insurer, and its role in paying for substance use disorder treatment
is growing.1 State Medicaid programs are required to cover all seven
medications, including two non-nicotine medications--varenicline and
buproprion--approved by the Food and Drug Administration for smoking
cessation.2, 3 As of June 30, 2017, 32 states covered all seven of these
medications for all traditional (non-expansion) Medicaid enrollees.4 However,
barriers such as copayments, prior authorization, limits on the number of
treatments allowed per year, or limits on how long treatment can be provided,
may make it difficult for Medicaid enrollees to obtain these medications.4

New York's Medicaid program pays for non-nicotine cessation medications.5
Because most people who smoke make multiple quit attempts before succeeding,
New York does not cap the number of times each year it will pay for the
medication for a client insured through Medicaid.5 This may be especially
beneficial for behavioral health clients who smoke as they tend to be heavier
smokers and may need extra help following medication regimens.6 With funding
from New York's Bureau of Tobacco Control to promote universal provision of
tobacco dependence treatment services, the Center of Excellence for Health
Systems Improvement:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Gathered information from the state Bureau of Tobacco Control, the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, and the Office of Mental Health,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Outlined what each behavioral health regulatory body requires and recommends for providing tobacco cessation medication,7 and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Drafted a Tobacco Dependence Treatment Financial Modeling Tool that, once finalized, will be piloted by Department of Health grantees assisting health care organizations. The Tool is intended to help the health care organizations better understand the costs and benefits of taking a range of steps to help people who smoke quit, including providing cessation medications on-site.8

Similarly, Oklahoma's Medicaid program pays for non-nicotine cessation
medications.9 It does not limit the number of times each year a client insured
through Medicaid can access bupropion, one of the two non-nicotine medications
approved by the FDA for tobacco cessation.10 The changes that were made to
Oklahoma's Medicaid program to provide this coverage stemmed from a
partnership between the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the Oklahoma Tobacco
Settlement Endowment Trust, and the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The
group:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Identified who was responsible for policy change,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Gathered data about the costs of providing cessation medications, the number of people who would seek the medications, and the number of people who likely would quit using tobacco, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Showed what the return on investment would be if cessation medications were covered by Medicaid at no cost to the client.11

The proportion of Oklahoma mental health treatment facilities and the
proportion of New York mental and substance use disorder treatment facilities
providing non-nicotine medications to clients is nearly double the proportion
of behavioral health treatment facilities doing so elsewhere in the U.S.6

Medicaid Tobacco Cessation Coverage in Oklahoma: A Case Study in Leveraging Systems and Partnerships. pdf icon[PDF - 2 MB] Note that this case study indicated that there were limits on the amount of medications Medicaid enrollees could access each year, and that the partnership was working on removing those caps on all FDA-approved cessation medications, except varenicline. Since the case study was written, the partnership achieved this goal.
