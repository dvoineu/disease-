Most human infections with Asian H5N1 viruses in other countries have occurred after prolonged and close contact with infected sick or dead birds.

Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus occurs mainly in
birds and is highly contagious among them. HPAI Asian H5N1 is especially
deadly for poultry. The virus was first detected in 1996 in geese in China.
Asian H5N1 was first detected in humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in
Hong Kong and has since been detected in poultry and wild birds in more than
50 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Six countries are
considered to be endemic for Asian HPAI H5N1 virus in poultry (Bangladesh,
China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam).

Since its widespread re-emergence in 2003, rare, sporadic human infections
with this virus have been reported in Asia, and later in Africa, Europe, and
the Middle East. Human infections with Asian H5N1 viruses have been associated
with severe disease and death. Most human infections with avian influenza
viruses, including HPAI Asian H5N1 viruses, have occurred after prolonged and
close contact with infected birds. Rare human-to-human spread with this virus
has occurred, but it has not been sustained and no community spread of this
virus has ever been identified.

In January 2014, Canada reported the first human infection with HPAI Asian
H5N1 virus in the Americas. This was an "imported" case occurring in a
traveler who had recently returned from China. To date, there have not been
any reports of HPAI Asian H5N1 virus infections in people in the United States
and Asian H5N1 has never been detected in U.S. birds or poultry. (The H5N1
virus recently detected in U.S. wild birds is a new mixed virus (a
reassortant) that is genetically different from the Asian avian H5N1 viruses).

Flu viruses are constantly changing and animal flu viruses can change such
that they may gain the ability to infect people easily and spread among
people, causing a pandemic. Human infections with novel avian influenza virus
like Asian H5N1 are concerning because of this pandemic potential. CDC takes
routine public health preparedness measures whenever a virus with pandemic
potential is identified. Because Asian H5N1 continues to circulate and has
been responsible for a number of human infections, Asian H5 preparedness
efforts have been extensive. Asian H5N1 vaccine is being stockpiled for
pandemic preparedness by the United States government. It could be used if an
HPAI H5N1 virus begins transmitting easily and efficiently from person to
person.
