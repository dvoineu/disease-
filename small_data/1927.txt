### Appendix 2: Roles and Responsibilities in a Regional Laboratory System for
Providing for Molecular Drug-Resistance Testing for TB

CDC should establish regional laboratories to provide molecular DR testing for
rifampin resistance and isoniazid resistance for TB control programs in the
United States and affiliated jurisdictions. The goal is to provide sufficient
testing capacity to enable molecular drug-resistance testing for (1) one AFB
smear-positive or NAA-positive respiratory specimen or one _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ culture from each TB patient or TB suspect ('universal testing')
and (2) specimens or isolates from persons that the TB Program designates as
high priority for molecular DR testing ('judicious use testing'). For
universal testing, it should be noted that there were ~5000 pulmonary AFB-
smear-positive TB cases reported to CDC in 2007; an approximately equal number
of AFB-smear-positive specimens due to non-tuberculosis mycobacteria; and
~7,400 pulmonary and ~3000 extrapulmonary culture-confirmed TB cases reported
to CDC in 2007. Thus, universal testing would entail testing 10,000 to 20,000
samples per year.

A phased approach to developing and implementing a molecular DR testing
service will be needed. As a first step, it would be essential to provide
molecular DR testing services for testing TB patients or suspects at high-risk
of having MDR TB and those deemed high priority by the program. This could be
accomplished by providing sufficient new funding to existing, proficient
molecular DR testing laboratories to allow them to expand their capacities to
meet this need. If done as supplements to existing cooperative agreements,
this could be done quickly. These programs could also serve as pilot projects
by offering universal testing for selected programs. Such an interim service
would allow time to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. compare the performances and costs of currently available validated molecular DR tests and select one or more for use in the molecular DR testing service;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. assess and overcome potential obstacles and barriers to a regional approach to diagnostic testing such as local regulations regarding out-of-state testing, reporting requirement, and need for memoranda of agreement;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. develop a strategy to coordinate or integrate services provided by the molecular DR testing laboratories and the TB genotyping laboratories to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and shipment of isolates;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. develop a roll-out strategy for the molecular DR testing service to include informing potential service users of the availability of the service, how to access the service, and the appropriate use and interpretation of molecular DR tests for TB;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5. define the scope of the molecular DR testing service more precisely by providing reliable estimates of the anticipated numbers of non-processed specimens, processed specimens, and cultures to be tested;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6. design a molecular DR testing service to meet the needs of local and state TB control programs; and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        7. develop, compete, and award a request for contract to provide the services.

In addition to molecular DR testing, the resources of the molecular DR testing
laboratory might be leveraged to provide other services for state and local TB
programs and laboratories, such as NAA testing for detection, culturing,
second-line drug susceptibility testing, or genotyping. The scope of any
additional service must be clearly defined and adequately funded.

**Cost estimate** for 2500 samples per year (10 per day)  
One laboratory needed for judicious use; a second laboratory may be needed as
a backup. Four laboratories are likely to be needed for universal testing.  
Estimates do not include the cost of processing specimens at the molecular DR
testing laboratory.
