Human scabies is caused by an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (
_Sarcoptes scabiei_ var. _hominis_ ). The microscopic scabies mite burrows
into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. The most
common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash.
The scabies mite usually is spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact
with a person who has scabies.

Scabies occurs worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes.
Scabies can spread rapidly under crowded conditions where close body contact
is frequent. Institutions such as nursing homes, extended-care facilities, and
prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.
