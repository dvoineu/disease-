                      * ### TRAINING

Free, online trainings are available for healthcare providers who care for
women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, and for those who work with
individuals living with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). These online
trainings provide strategies to improve the delivery of care related to FASDs
and their prevention.

See Course Listings

                      * ### PREVENTION RESOURCES

Learn how you can help reduce alcohol use and alcohol-exposed pregnancies
among pregnant and non-pregnant women who might be at risk. Find prevention
resources and trainings here.

(https://www.cdc.gov/)

                      * ### DIAGNOSIS RESOURCES

Determining if a child has an FASD takes several steps. There is no simple
test for diagnosis. Access resources and free continuing education trainings
that help medical and community workers identify, refer, and care for
individuals who may have FASDs.

(https://www.cdc.gov/)

                      * ### CARE RESOURCES

There is no cure for FASDs, but research shows that early intervention and
support services can improve the lives of affected individuals and their
families. Find out more about these interventions and services here.
