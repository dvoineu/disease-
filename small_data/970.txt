CDC is pleased to launch the third Medscape continuing medical education (CME)
activity for healthcare providers " **Diagnosing Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Experts Weigh In**."

The goal is to increase recognition of symptoms of ME/CFS by using the
Institute of Medicine (IOM) diagnostic criteria for patient assessment. The
faculty include Lucinda Bateman, MD, Natalie Azar, MD, Nancy Klimas, MD, and
Jose Montoya, MD.

The video is intended for all healthcare providers with an emphasis on the
primary care providers. The course, hosted by Medscape, provides CME/CE
credit.
