# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Plague

**What is plague?  
** Plague is a disease caused by _Yersinia pestis_ ( _Y. pestis_ ), a
bacterium found in rodents and their fleas in many areas around the world.

**Why are we concerned about pneumonic plague as a bioweapon?  
** Yersinia pestis used in an aerosol attack could cause cases of the
pneumonic form of plague. One to six days after becoming infected with the
bacteria, people would develop pneumonic plague. Once people have the disease,
the bacteria can spread to others who have close contact with them. Because of
the delay between being exposed to the bacteria and becoming sick, people
could travel over a large area before becoming contagious and possibly
infecting others. Controlling the disease would then be more difficult. A
bioweapon carrying _Y. pestis_ is possible because the bacterium occurs in
nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory. Even so,
manufacturing an effective weapon using _Y. pestis_ would require advanced
knowledge and technology.

**Is pneumonic plague different from bubonic plague?  
** Yes. Both are caused by _Yersinia pestis_ , but they are transmitted
differently and their symptoms differ. Pneumonic plague can be transmitted
from person to person; bubonic plague cannot. Pneumonic plague affects the
lungs and is transmitted when a person breathes in _Y. pestis_ particles in
the air. Bubonic plague is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or
exposure to infected material through a break in the skin. Symptoms include
swollen, tender lymph glands called buboes. Buboes are not present in
pneumonic plague. If bubonic plague is not treated, however, the bacteria can
spread through the bloodstream and infect the lungs, causing a secondary case
of pneumonic plague.

**What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonic plague?  
** Patients usually have fever, weakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia
with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery
sputum. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also occur. Without early
treatment, pneumonic plague usually leads to respiratory failure, shock, and
rapid death.

**How do people become infected with pneumonic plague?  
** Pneumonic plague occurs when _Yersinia pestis_ infects the lungs.
Transmission can take place if someone breathes in _Y. pestis_ particles,
which could happen in an aerosol release during a bioterrorism attack.
Pneumonic plague is also transmitted by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in
respiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague.
Respiratory droplets are spread most readily by coughing or sneezing. Becoming
infected in this way usually requires direct and close (within 6 feet) contact
with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also occur if a person
with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and the bacteria spread to the
lungs.

**Does plague occur naturally?  
** Yes. The World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague
worldwide every year. An average of 5 to 15 cases occur each year in the
western United States. These cases are usually scattered and occur in rural to
semi-rural areas. Most cases are of the bubonic form of the disease. Naturally
occurring pneumonic plague is uncommon, although small outbreaks do occur.
Both types of plague are readily controlled by standard public health response
measures.

**Can a person exposed to pneumonic plague avoid becoming sick?  
** Yes. People who have had close contact with an infected person can greatly
reduce the chance of becoming sick if they begin treatment within 7 days of
their exposure. Treatment consists of taking antibiotics for at least 7 days.

**How quickly would someone get sick if exposed to plague bacteria through the
air?  
** Someone exposed to _Yersinia pestis_ through the air--either from an
intentional aerosol release or from close and direct exposure to someone with
plague pneumonia--would become ill within 1 to 6 days.

**Can pneumonic plague be treated?  
** Yes. To prevent a high risk of death, antibiotics should be given within 24
hours of the first symptoms. Several types of antibiotics are effective for
curing the disease and for preventing it. Available oral medications are a
tetracycline (such as doxycycline) or a fluoroquinolone (such as
ciprofloxacin). For injection or intravenous use, streptomycin or gentamicin
antibiotics are used. Early in the response to a bioterrorism attack, these
drugs would be tested to determine which is most effective against the
particular weapon that was used.

**Would enough medication be available in the event of a bioterrorism attack
involving pneumonic plague?  
** National and state public health officials have large supplies of drugs
needed in the event of a bioterrorism attack. These supplies can be sent
anywhere in the United States within 12 hours.

**What should someone do if they suspect they or others have been exposed to
plague?  
** Get immediate medical attention: To prevent illness, a person who has been
exposed to pneumonic plague must receive antibiotic treatment without delay.
If an exposed person becomes ill, antibiotics must be administered within 24
hours of their first symptoms to reduce the risk of death. Notify authorities:
Immediately notify local or state health departments so they can begin to
investigate and control the problem right away. If bioterrorism is suspected,
the health departments will notify the CDC, FBI, and other appropriate
authorities.

******How can the general public reduce the risk of getting pneumonic plague
from another person or giving it to someone else?  
** If possible, avoid close contact with other people. People having direct
and close contact with someone with pneumonic plague should wear tightly
fitting disposable surgical masks. If surgical masks are not available, even
makeshift face coverings made of layers of cloth may be helpful in an
emergency. People who have been exposed to a contagious person can be
protected from developing plague by receiving prompt antibiotic treatment.

**How is plague diagnosed?  
** The first step is evaluation by a health worker. If the health worker
suspects pneumonic plague, samples of the patient's blood, sputum, or lymph
node aspirate are sent to a laboratory for testing. Once the laboratory
receives the sample, preliminary results can be ready in less than two hours.
Confirmation will take longer, usually 24 to 48 hours.

**How long can plague bacteria exist in the environment?  
** Yersinia pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when
released into air, the bacterium will survive for up to one hour, depending on
conditions.

**Is a vaccine available to prevent pneumonic plague?  
** Currently, no plague vaccine is available in the United States. Research is
in progress, but we are not likely to have vaccines for several years or more.
