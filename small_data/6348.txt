## Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs)



**What are the Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs) for acute chemical
exposures?**

The Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs) for Acute Chemical Exposures were
developed by ATSDR to aid emergency department physicians and other emergency
healthcare professionals who manage acute exposures resulting from chemical
incidents. The MMGs are intended to aid healthcare professionals involved in
emergency response to effectively decontaminate patients, protect themselves
and others from contamination, communicate with other involved personnel,
efficiently transport patients to a medical facility, and provide competent
medical evaluation and treatment to exposed persons.

The Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs) for Acute Chemical Exposures provide:
