# Obesity Among WIC-Enrolled Young Children

Related Pages

Obesity affects children from low-income families more than children from
high-income families. Children in low-income families are often served by the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

To monitor obesity prevalence and identify priority areas that need attention,
the CDC works with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which
administers WIC at national and regional levels. The CDC and USDA analyze data
from the WIC Participant and Program Characteristics Reportexternal icon (WIC
PC).

WIC PC is a biennial census, conducted by the USDA in April of even years. WIC
PC summarizes the demographic characteristics of WIC participants nationwide
and includes information on nutrition risk characteristics such as weight
status.

### What is WIC?

WIC is a federal program that promotes healthy eating and nutrition education
for infants and children up to age 5, and low-income women who are pregnant,
postpartum, or breastfeeding.

Nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood is critical for healthy child
growth and development. To be eligible for WICexternal icon, women, infants,
and children must meet residential, income, and nutrition risk requirements.

### State-Level Data Show Modest Decline in Obesity Among WIC-Enrolled Young
Children

A study published in November 2019 found 41 WIC state and territory agencies
with significant declines in obesity among children aged 2-4 years between
2010 and 2016. That compared with 34 WIC state agencies reporting a decline in
obesity among this age group from 2010 to 2014. Obesity prevalence reported in
2016 varied from 7.8 percent to 19.8 percent. Read the press release and  full
report.

More than 12 million children from 56 WIC state agencies and territories were
in the analytic sample. Other findings included:

### National Trends Indicate Decline in Obesity Among WIC-Enrolled Young
Children

For a research letterexternal icon published in April 2019, CDC and USDA
authors analyzed national obesity trends from 2010 to 2016 among children aged
2-4 years from WIC-enrolled families. The authors found that:

That was a decrease from 15.5% in 2010. Obesity had increased among this group from 2000 - 2010.

aCrude prevalence. Biologically implausible z scores were defined as the
following when calculating the prevalence: height for age less than −5.0 or
above 4.0, weight for age less than −5.0 or above 8.0, and body mass index for
age less than −4.0 or more than 8.0.

bCalculated from prevalence in 2010 and adjusted prevalence ratio between 2010
and 2016 obtained from log binomial regression model controlled for age, sex,
and race/ethnicity: [prevalence in 2010 x adjusted prevalence ratio between
2010 and 2016] - prevalence in 2010.

cP<0.001 for trend tests with all years' data included; P values were obtained
from log binomial regression models controlled for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity.

dTrends are presented by race/ethnicity because they are important for
identifying health disparities.

aCrude prevalence. Biologically implausible z scores were defined as the
following when calculating the prevalence: height for age less than −5.0 or
above 4.0, weight for age less than −5.0 or above 8.0, and body mass index for
age less than −4.0 or more than 8.0.

bCalculated from prevalence in 2010 and adjusted prevalence ratio between 2010

and race/ethnicity: [prevalence in 2010 x adjusted prevalence ratio between
2010 and 2016] - prevalence in 2010.

from log binomial regression models controlled for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity.

dTrends are presented by race/ethnicity because they are important for

### Obesity Prevalence Based on Height to Weight Ratio Among WIC-Enrolled
Infants Declined from 2010-2014

One way to measure infants' relative weight is to consider their weight and
length. Infants with high weight for their length are at increased risk of
obesity in childhood and early adulthood.

A study published in 2016external icon found that overall, the prevalence of
WIC-enrolled infants aged 3 to 23 months with high weight for their length
decreased from 14.5% in 2010 to 12.3% in 2014. During this time, 36 states and
territories observed a significant decrease in high weight-for-length among
infants aged 3 to-23 months. See state and territory specific information.

The study reported the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * High weight-for-length varied across racial/ethnic groups with the 2014 prevalence higher among American Indian (15.6%) and Hispanic (13.8%) infants than among black (11.9%), white (11%), and Asians/Pacific Islander (8.5%) infants.
