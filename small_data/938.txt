##  Prevention

There is currently no vaccine to protect people against MERS. But scientists
are working to develop one.

You can help reduce your risk of getting respiratory illnesses:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Avoid personal contact, such as kissing, or sharing cups or eating utensils, with sick people.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs.

If you are caring for or living with a person confirmed to have, or being
evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection, see Interim Guidance for Preventing MERS-
CoV from Spreading in Homes and Communities.

##  Treatment

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for MERS-CoV infection.
Individuals with MERS often receive medical care to help relieve symptoms. For
severe cases, current treatment includes care to support vital organ
functions.

If you think you may have been exposed MERS-CoV, see People at Increased Risk
for MERS.
