###  **Summary**

**What is already known about this topic?**

Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer
death among cancers affecting men and women, reduces incidence and mortality.
The percentage of persons who report being up to date with CRC screening has
increased, but not equally among all populations.

**What is added by this report?**

In 2018, 68.8% of adults were up to date with CRC screening test use, but
screening prevalence was 15.9 percentage points lower among those aged 50-64
years than among those aged 65-75 years.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Specific population-based efforts to increase CRC screening are needed so that
screening might start at age 50 years and continue as recommended through age
75 years for maximum benefit.

## Abstract

**Background:** Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States of cancers that affect both men and women. Despite
strong evidence that screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality, CRC
screening prevalence is below the national target. This report describes
current CRC screening prevalence by age, various demographic factors, and
state.

**Methods:** Data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
survey were analyzed to estimate the percentages of adults aged 50-75 years
who reported CRC screening consistent with the United States Preventive
Services Task Force recommendation.

**Results:** In 2018, 68.8% of adults were up to date with CRC screening. The
percentage up to date was 79.2% among respondents aged 65-75 years and 63.3%
among those aged 50-64 years. CRC screening prevalence was lowest among
persons aged 50-54 years (50.0%) and increased with age. Among respondents
aged 50-64 years, CRC screening prevalence was lowest among persons without
health insurance (32.6%) and highest among those with reported annual
household income of ≥$75,000 (70.8%). Among respondents aged 65-75 years, CRC
screening prevalence was lowest among those without a regular health care
provider (45.6%), and highest among those with reported annual household
income ≥$75,000 (87.1%). Among states, CRC screening prevalence was highest in
Massachusetts (76.5%) and lowest in Wyoming (57.8%).

**Discussion:** CRC screening prevalence is lower among adults aged 50-64
years, although most reported having a health care provider and health
insurance. Concerted efforts are needed to inform persons aged <50 years about
the benefit of screening so that screening can start at age 50 years.

## Introduction

Of cancers that affect both men and women, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2016, 141,270
cases were diagnosed, and 52,286 persons died from the disease ( _1_ ). The
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults at average risk
(those who do not have a personal or family history of CRC or polyps, do not
have inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of genetic syndromes associated
with CRC) aged 50-75 years be screened for CRC by any of six available tests:
1) fecal occult blood test (FOBT), 2) fecal immunochemical test (FIT), 3)
multitarget stool DNA (FIT-DNA), 4) computed tomographic colonography (CTC),
5) sigmoidoscopy, or 6) colonoscopy ( _2_ ). Strong evidence exists that
screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality ( _2_ ). Both CRC incidence
and mortality have declined steadily over the past 30 years; the decline is
attributable in part to the increasing percentage of adults aged 50-75 years
who are up to date with CRC screening (i.e., have completed a CRC screening
test within the recommended time interval) ( _3_ , _4_ ). Despite steady
gains, the prevalence of CRC screening is lower than the stated national
Healthy People 2020 target of 70.5%, and not all populations have achieved
equivalent gains in CRC screening ( _5_ ). This report describes current CRC
screening among U.S. adults aged 50-75 years, by demographic characteristics
and state.

## Methods

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual, state-
based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized adult population aged ≥18 years that collects information
on health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access
in the United States. The median response rate for the 2018 BRFSS combined
landline and cellular phone survey was 49.9% ( _6_ ). All states and the
District of Columbia asked BRFSS respondents aged ≥50 years a series of
questions about their CRC screening status.* Among 222,490 respondents aged
50-75 years, 16,127 (7.2%) declined to answer, had a missing answer, or
answered "don't know/not sure" and were excluded from the analysis. Screening
status (up to date with CRC screening†) was analyzed by age groups, various
demographic characteristics, and state. Data were weighted to the age, sex,
and racial/ethnic distribution of each state's adult population using
intercensal estimates and were age-standardized to the 2018 BRFSS population.
Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate significant (p<0.005) differences in
screening compliance by age group (50-64 years and 65-75 years). A test for
trend was used to evaluate a significant (p<0.005) relationship between age
and up-to-date screening status. SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 9.4: RTI
International) was used to analyze all data.

## Results

In 2018, 68.8% of respondents reported they were up to date with CRC
screening, including 79.2% of respondents aged 65-75 years and 63.3% of
respondents aged 50-64 years (Table 1). Among all demographic groups studied,
a significantly higher percentage of respondents aged 65-75 years reported
being up to date with CRC screening than did respondents aged 50-64 years
(p<0.005). The difference in the percentage of respondents who were up to date
between those aged 65-75 years and those aged 50-64 years was largest (23.1
percentage points) among those without health insurance and smallest (11.1
percentage points) among respondents who identified as non-Hispanic
other/multiracial. The percentage of respondents who were up to date was
lowest among those aged 50-54 years (50.0%) and highest among those aged 70-75
years (81.3%); increasing age was significantly associated with an increasing
percentage of persons who were up to date (p<0.005) (Figure).

Among younger respondents (those aged 50-64 years), reported CRC screening
prevalence was lowest among those without a regular health care provider
(32.7%) and those without health insurance (32.6%) and highest among those
reporting an annual household income of ≥$75,000 (70.8%) and college graduates
(70.7%) (Table 1). In this age group, the percentage of respondents who were
up to date with CRC screening was higher among women (65.4%), those with
health insurance (66.7%), those with a regular health care provider (68.1%),
and those living in metropolitan areas (68.1%) than it was among men (61.1%),
those without health insurance (32.6%), those without a regular health care
provider (32.7%), and those living in non-metropolitan areas (64.4%). As
education level and annual household income increased, the percentage of
respondents who were up to date with CRC testing also increased.

Among older respondents (aged 65-75 years), reported screening prevalence was
lowest among those without a regular health care provider (45.6%) and highest
among those who reported annual household income ≥$75,000 (87.1%). Similar to
respondents aged 50-64 years, the percentage up to date with screening was
higher among women, those with health insurance, those with a health care
provider, and those living in metropolitan areas and increased with increasing
education and annual household income levels. Overall, 81% of respondents aged
50-64 years and 94% of those aged 65-75 years who had never been screened
reported having health insurance.

Among states, Massachusetts had the highest percentage of all adults aged
50-75 years and those aged 50-64 years who were up to date with CRC screening
(76.5% and 72.1%, respectively), whereas Wyoming had the lowest percentage
(57.8% and 51.5%, respectively) (Table 2). Among adults aged 65-75 years,
Rhode Island had the highest percentage who were up to date (84.9%) and
Wyoming had the lowest (68.5%). The percentage of adults aged 50-64 years who
were up to date was ≥70.5% in four states and <60% in 11 states. In contrast,
among adults aged 65-75 years the percentage who were up to date exceeded
70.5% in 49 states and the District of Columbia.

## Discussion

An estimated 68.8% of adults aged 50-75 years were up to date with CRC
screening in 2018; however, screening prevalence among adults aged 50-64 years
was 15.9 percentage points lower than that among persons aged 65-75 years. The
percentage up to date with CRC screening varied widely across subgroups, with
a 54.5 percentage-point difference between the subgroups with the highest
(persons aged 65-75 years with reported annual household income ≥$75,000) and
the lowest (persons aged 50-64 years without health insurance) screening
prevalence. Up to date CRC screening status increased with increasing age,
suggesting that many eligible adults are not receiving important screening
that can prevent or detect CRC early, when treatment is more effective.

CRC screening has increased steadily among adults over the past twenty years,
but screening prevalence has been consistently higher among those aged 65-75
years than among those aged 50-64 years ( _7_ ). Visits to a primary care
provider have been associated with participation in CRC screening ( _8_ - _10_
). In one study, among Medicaid enrollees who had reached age 50 years within
the study time frame, 75% had at least one primary care visit within 1 year,
but only 17% were screened for CRC during that year. The percentage who
initiated screening increased as the number of primary care visits within the
previous year increased ( _9_ ). Having a primary care visit at age 49 years
was associated with higher CRC screening initiation at age 50 years, but only
69% of patients saw a provider at age 49 years ( _11_ ). Modeling studies have
estimated that initiating screening at age 50 years results in larger
decreases in population CRC incidence and mortality than when screening is
started at age 55 years, suggesting that delayed or slow uptake of CRC
screening might diminish the beneficial effect of screening on the population
( _12_ ).

Although lack of health insurance has been strongly associated with low CRC
screening prevalence ( _7_ ), the majority of persons in this study who had
never been screened reported having health insurance. Other patient barriers
to CRC screening include lack of a provider recommendation, being offered
colonoscopy only instead of a choice of tests, lack of awareness of the need
to be screened, fear, expense, competing priorities, inability to take time
off work if referred for a colonoscopy, and the perceived undesirable nature
of screening tests (e.g., sampling and storing fecal matter for stool tests or
completing a bowel preparation for colonoscopy) ( _13_ - _16_ ). Other factors
positively associated with CRC screening include use of other preventive
services such as cholesterol testing, receiving influenza vaccination, and
mammography or cervical cancer screening. Factors negatively associated with
CRC screening include provider workload and increasing distance to facilities
that perform colonoscopy. Patient comorbid disease might be positively
associated with CRC screening because these patients might see their health
care provider more frequently, thus increasing the number of opportunities to
offer screening, or negatively associated as patients with multiple comorbid
diseases might be sicker and unable to participate in screening ( _10_ , _11_
, _17_ , _18_ ). Less is known about how these factors vary and consequently
affect CRC screening by age.

There was substantial state variation in the percentage of adults aged 50-75
years who reported being up to date with CRC screening. Given that adults aged
50-64 years accounted for 60%-70% of the population of adults aged 50-75 years
in each state, in general, states with the highest reported CRC screening
prevalence for this age group also had the highest overall CRC screening
prevalence. Variations in the percentage of the population without health
insurance, who are racial/ethnic minorities, or who live in rural or frontier
areas, as well as the availability of providers who perform colonoscopy and
the number of primary care providers per capita, might also contribute to
differences in CRC screening by state.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First,
CRC screening prevalence might be overestimated because BRFSS does not specify
whether tests were done for screening or diagnostic purposes. Second, data are
self-reported and not validated by medical record review. Third, response
rates were low (49.9%), although the BRFSS weighting procedure accounts for
nonresponse, and 7.2% of all respondents did not answer all of the questions
and were excluded from the analysis.

CRC screening is a grade A recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force, meaning that there is strong evidence it effectively decreases CRC
incidence and mortality. A microsimulation modeling study found that
increasing CRC screening prevalence to 80% had the potential to decrease CRC
incidence and mortality by 22% and 33% respectively by 2030 ( _19_ ). This
would result in 277,000 new cases averted and 203,000 deaths prevented by
2030. These results assume that participants start screening at age 50 years
and continue periodic screening as recommended through age 75 years.

Whereas 68.8% of the U.S. population aged 50-75 years reports being up to date
with CRC screening, screening prevalence is lower among younger adults,
especially those aged 50-54 years. To achieve further increases in CRC
screening to maximize benefit, specific efforts to increase screening in
persons aged 50-64 years are needed. Partnerships between public health and
health care systems to implement evidence-based interventions such as those
described in The Community Guide ( _20_ ) (e.g., provider reminders, patient
reminders, provider assessment and feedback, and reduction of structural
barriers) can increase CRC screening even in hard-to-reach populations, as
demonstrated by CDC's Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP)
(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/crccp/about.htm). The CRCCP funds states, tribes,
and universities to partner with primary care clinics to implement evidence-
based interventions to increase CRC screening. Over 3 years, recipients
partnered with approximately 600 clinics reaching approximately 1 million
adults aged 50-75 years. Most clinics were Federally Qualified Health Centers,
which provide health care in underserved areas. Implementation of evidence-
based interventions resulted in an average 10 percentage-point increase in
screening prevalence in participating clinics. Additional efforts might
include educating adults about the benefit of screening well before age 50
years so that screening can start at age 50 years, providing education about
insurance coverage for preventive services, providing clear communication
about test options, and conducting research to identify and understand
barriers and facilitators to CRC screening specific to this younger age group
to inform effective interventions to increase screening.

* The following questions were asked as part of the Colorectal Cancer Screening module: "A blood stool test is a test that may use a special kit at home to determine whether the stool contains blood. Have you ever had this test using a home kit?," "How long has it been since you had your last blood stool test using a home kit?," "Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are exams in which a tube is inserted in the rectum to view the colon for signs of cancer or other health problems. Have you ever had either of these exams?," "For a sigmoidoscopy, a flexible tube is inserted into the rectum to look for problems. A colonoscopy is similar, but uses a longer tube, and you are usually given medication through a needle in your arm to make you sleepy and told to have someone else drive you home after the test. Was your most recent exam a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy?," and "How long has it been since you had your last sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy?."

† Current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for CRC
screening include more detailed test type information than can be fully
assessed using the data available in BRFSS. To best match the updated
recommendations, "up to date" was defined as the percentage of adults aged
50-75 years who reported having had a blood stool test (FOBT or FIT) within
the past year, a sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years, and/or a colonoscopy
within the past 10 years.
