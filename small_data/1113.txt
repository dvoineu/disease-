Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm species
_Taenia saginata_ (beef tapeworm), _Taenia solium_ (pork tapeworm), and
_Taenia asiatica_ (Asian tapeworm). Humans can become infected with these
tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef ( _T. saginata_ ) or pork ( _T.
solium_ and _T. asiatica_ ). People with taeniasis may not know they have a
tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.

_Taenia solium_ tapeworm infections can lead to cysticercosis, which is a
disease that can cause seizures, so it is important seek treatment.
