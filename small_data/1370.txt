_American Indian/Alaska Native_ is defined by the Office of Management and
Budget as "a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and
South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal
affiliation or community attachment."1 There are approximately 2.6 million
American Indians/Alaska Natives in the United States--about 1% of the total
population.2

American Indians/Alaska Natives have the highest prevalence of cigarette
smoking compared to all other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Some
American Indians use tobacco for ceremonial, religious, or medicinal
purposes.3 For this reason, it is important to make the distinction between
commercial and traditional tobacco use. When CDC references tobacco on this
website, we are referring to commercial tobacco and not the sacred and
traditional use of tobacco by some American Indian communities.

Traditional tobacco is tobacco and/or other plant mixtures grown or harvested
and used by American Indians and Alaska Natives for ceremonial or medicinal
purposes.

Traditional tobacco has been used by American Indian nations for centuries as
a medicine with cultural and spiritual importance. Many Tribes maintain
teachings and stories on the origin of tobacco. These teachings address
tobacco in its purest form, today known as the tobacco plant Nicotiana
rustica, and may include mixtures of other native plants.

Traditional tobacco preparation and use varies across Tribes and regions, with
Alaska Natives not commonly using traditional tobacco. These variances are due
to the many different teachings among Tribes of North America. In some
cultures, the roles of growing, harvesting, and preparing traditional tobacco
are held by specific groups of people who use traditional ways to prepare
tobacco for a specific use.

### Tobacco Use Prevalence

#### Current Tobacco Use* Among American Indian/Alaska Native Adults--2016†4

![Graph showing current tobacco use among American Indian/Alaska Native
adults—2016: Smokeless tobacco: 8.4%, Cigars: 4.1%, Cigarettes:
33.9%](/tobacco/disparities/american-indians/images/aian-1.jpg)

* "Current Use" is defined as self-reported consumption of cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco in the past month.  
† Data taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2016, and refer
to American Indians/Alaska Natives aged 18 years and older.

### Health Effects

#### American Indians/Alaska Natives have a higher risk of experiencing
tobacco-related disease and death due to high prevalence of cigarette smoking
and other commercial tobacco use.5,6

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among American Indians/Alaska Natives.7,8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death among American Indians/Alaska Natives.7,8 The risk of developing diabetes is 30-40% higher for smokers than nonsmokers.10

### Patterns of Tobacco Use

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * American Indian/Alaska Native youth and adults have the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking among all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S.9,12
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Regional variations in cigarette smoking exist among American Indians/Alaska Natives, with lower prevalence in the Southwest and higher prevalence in the Northern Plains and Alaska.6
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * More American Indian/Alaska Native women smoke during their last 3 months of pregnancy--26.0% compared to 14.3% of whites, 8.9% of African Americans, 3.4% of Hispanics, and 2.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders.13

### Quitting Behavior

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Quitting rates are relatively low among American Indians/Alaska Natives compared to other racial/ethnic groups.6,9,10,11
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * An estimated 55.6% of American Indians/Alaska Natives report that they want to quit compared to 72.8% of African Americans, 67.5% of Whites, 69.6% of Asians, and 67.4% of Hispanics.10,11

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Influence

#### Tobacco companies target American Indian/Alaska Native communities
through extensive promotions, sponsorships, and advertising campaigns.14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Historically, tobacco industry product promotions to American Indians/Alaska Natives featured symbols and names with special meanings to this group. For example, the American Spirit™ cigarettes were promoted as "natural" cigarettes, and their packaging featured an American Indian smoking a pipe.9

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among the American
Indian/Alaska Native population.

### Resources

#### Publications

Because American Indian tribes are sovereign nations and have unique cultural
practices and because data from national surveys may be limited or
underestimated due to small sample sizes, CDC's Office on Smoking and Health
developed the American Indian Adult Tobacco Survey to assist tribes in
collecting tribal- and village-specific commercial tobacco use and secondhand
exposure data.
