# Health Alert Template for LGV

Minus

Related Pages

Instructions

The template health alert below can be adapted and used by a health department
to notify local public health practitioners, clinicians, public health
laboratories, and public information officers about any confirmed, probable or
suspected cases of LGV in their jurisdiction. It is customizable - you should
use data from your jurisdiction to make it relevant to your community. You can
customize this article further by including details about the local
epidemiology, related health department activities, case report forms, and a
point of contact for reporting confirmed, probable or suspected LGV cases.

## Background



LGV is a sexually transmitted infection caused by L1, L2, or L3 genotypes of
_Chlamydia trachomatis._ It is typically characterized by:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. A lymphadenopathy syndrome consisting of genital ulcers that are commonly self-limited, inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy that is commonly tender, unilateral, and possibly suppurative; or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Proctocolitis syndrome presenting with rectal bleeding, discharge, pain, tenesmus, and constipation with mucosal inflammation, purulence, and/or ulcerations on anoscopy.

Asymptomatic rectal LGV infections have also been reported.
