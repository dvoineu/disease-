# ADHD Throughout the Years

Minus

Related Pages

The percent of children estimated to have ADHD has changed over time and its
measurement can vary. The first national survey that asked parents about ADHD
was completed in 1997. Since that time, there has been an upward trend in
national estimates of parent-reported ADHD diagnoses across different surveys,
using different age ranges. It is not possible to tell whether this increase
represents a change in the number of children who have ADHD, or a change in
the number of children who were diagnosed. However, the most recent estimates
are consistent with previous estimates. Future data will show whether the
upward trend across the two decades is leveling out.

***Redesigned NSCH:**Now an online and mail surveyexternal icon; estimate
includes children 2-17 years of age. Because the 2016 NSCH survey used
different methods, the estimate is not directly comparable with estimates
based on previous NSCH data [Read key findings _]_

**Note:** Age ranges for published data vary. In previous decades, the focus
of information collected on ADHD generally was on school age children; this
has been expanded to include preschool ages as young as 2 years of age.
Because the number of children with ADHD increases with age, estimates that
include younger children are likely to be somewhat lower than those that focus
on older children.

### History

Estimates for the percent of children in the population who have ADHD vary
widely across time and across survey methods. A historical view can provide
necessary context to understand changes in the epidemiology of ADHD. The way
that ADHD is diagnosed has changed over time, so the difference in these
numbers is likely to be influenced by variations in how the diagnostic
criteria were applied. In addition, there were differences in the demographic
characteristics of the samples used to calculate the estimates. It is also
possible that the samples were exposed to factors that affect ADHD, but until
more is known about these factors, it is not possible to know whether changes
in these factors explain some of the variation. Perhaps relatedly, the number
of FDA-approved ADHD medications increased noticeably since the 1990s, after
the introduction of long-acting formulations.
