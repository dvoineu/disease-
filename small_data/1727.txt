Each year, we recognize World TB Day on March 24. This annual event
commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB). The
2020 World TB Day theme is "It's Time". The information below may be helpful
in planning communication activities to inform and educate partners,
stakeholders, and media about TB-related problems and solutions, and the
importance of supporting worldwide TB control efforts.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Too many people in the U.S. still suffer from TB disease. We must continue to find and treat cases of active TB disease and also test and treat latent TB infection to prevent progression to disease and turn TB elimination into a reality.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Clinicians, health care agencies, and community organizations, especially those serving at-risk populations, have a critical role in TB elimination.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * TB anywhere is TB everywhere. TB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person. To end TB, we must continue to work together to fight this epidemic on multiple fronts, and stop the suffering associated with this disease, here at home - and around the world.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Expanding targeted testing and treatment of latent TB infection is key to eliminating TB disease in the United States.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Up to 13 million people in the United States have latent TB infection, and without treatment, are at risk for developing TB disease in the future.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * CDC continues to recommend the use of the short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) for treatment of latent TB infection. Shorter treatment regimens can help patients' complete treatment faster and with fewer side effects.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **It 's time we strengthen TB education and awareness among health care providers.**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * There is a strong need for TB education and outreach to clinicians, health care agencies, and community organizations, especially those serving at-risk populations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Many of those at high risk for latent TB infection or TB disease who need to be reached do not traditionally receive care in health departments -- but are seen by private community providers and community health centers. Engaging these partners is critical to future success.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Misdiagnosis of TB disease still exists, and health care professionals often do not "think TB." Limited training opportunities in TB clinical, laboratory, and research has led to a loss of expertise and experience in TB.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **It 's time to end stigma.**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Anyone can get TB. TB is spread through the air, and everyone breathes. People with TB can be found in every state - where we work, live, learn, and spend time with family and friends.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Ending TB in the United States requires maintaining and strengthening current TB control priorities while increasing efforts to identify and treat latent TB infection among high-risk populations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Efforts to address latent TB infection must include public health systems and private providers who provide healthcare in the communities most affected by TB.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **It 's time to speak up.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Achieving our national goal for TB elimination will require not only maximizing all available tools, but also continuing to engage global TB partners. These partnerships will be essential given the greater impact of TB among individuals from nations who lack comparable TB control systems.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Public health departments provide TB-related technical assistance, education, and outreach to clinicians, health care agencies, and community organizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Stories from TB survivors can encourage patients to complete treatment and raise awareness of TB in the United States and around the world.
