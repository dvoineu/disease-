People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) include all races
and ethnicities, ages, and socioeconomic groups, and come from all parts of
the U.S. It is estimated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons make up
approximately 3% of the total U.S. population.1

Cigarette smoking among LGB individuals in the U.S. is higher than among
heterosexual/straight individuals. About 1 in 5 LGB adults smoke cigarettes
compared with about 1 in 6 heterosexual/straight adults.2

### Cigarette Smoking Prevalence

#### 20.5% of LGB adults smoke cigarettes compared to 15.3% of straight
adults.2

![Graph showing cigarette smoking prevalence among LBG \(20.5%\) and straight
\(15.3%\) adults](/tobacco/disparities/lgbt/images/lgbt-1.jpg)* Data taken
from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey and refer to adults aged 18
years and older.



#### _Transgender Individuals_

Limited information exists on cigarette smoking prevalence among transgender
people; however, cigarette smoking prevalence among transgender adults is
reported to be higher than among the general population of adults.3

The transgender population is considered especially vulnerable because of high
rates of substance abuse, depression, HIV infection, and social and employment
discrimination, all of which are associated with higher smoking prevalence.4

### Health Effects

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Gay men have high rates of HPV infection which, when coupled with tobacco use, increases their risk for anal and other cancers.5
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * LGBT individuals often have risk factors for smoking that include daily stress related to prejudice and stigma that they may face.6,7
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Bartenders and servers in LGBT nightclubs are exposed to high levels of secondhand smoke.8
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Among women, secondhand smoke exposure is more common among non-smoking lesbian women than among non-smoking straight women.9

### Quitting Behavior

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * LGB individuals are 5 times more likely than others to never intend to call a smoking cessation quitline.10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * LGBT individuals are less likely to have health insurance than straight individuals,11 which may negatively affect health as well as access to cessation treatments, including counseling and medication.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Gay, bisexual, and transgender men are 20% less likely than straight men to be aware of smoking quitlines despite LGBT individuals having exposure to tobacco cessation advertising similar to straight individuals' exposure.12

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Influence

#### High rates of tobacco use within the LGBT community are due in part to
the aggressive marketing by tobacco companies that sponsor events, bar
promotions, giveaways, and advertisements.4,5,13

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Tobacco companies advertise at "gay pride" festivals and other LGBT community events and contribute to local and national LGBT and HIV/AIDS organizations.5
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Tobacco advertisements in gay and lesbian publications often depict tobacco use as a "normal" part of LGBT life.4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The tobacco industry encourages menthol cigarette use among LGBT populations.13
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Approximately 36% of LGBT smokers report smoking menthol cigarettes compared to 29% of heterosexual/straight smokers.13
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The marketing campaign, Project SCUM (Sub-Culture Urban Marketing), was created in the mid-1990s by a tobacco company to target LGBT and homeless populations.14

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among the LGBT population.
