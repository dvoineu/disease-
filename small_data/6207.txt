Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a prion disease that was first
described in 1996 in the United Kingdom. There is now strong scientific
evidence that the agent responsible for the outbreak of prion disease in cows,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or 'mad cow' disease), is the same agent
responsible for the outbreak of vCJD in humans.
