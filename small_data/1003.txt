This can promote support and understanding.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Encouraging patients to find enjoyable, low-effort activities to engage in with family or loved ones.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Helping patients to develop effective coping skills to help ease worry, anger, hopelessness, or other feelings. This may include a referral to counseling or support groups if available and possible.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Encouraging patients to consider using energy saving devices, which many patients have found to be helpful. For example, using a wheelchair to cover longer distances in grocery stores or enjoy family events or trips.

Professional counseling with a trained supportive counselor will help most
patients with any kind of chronic illness to build effective coping skills to
lessen the grief, anger, and guilt that may accompany chronic illness and help
empower patients to seek comprehensive care.

Chronic illnesses like ME/CFS affect entire families, not just patients.
Consulting a behavioral health professional may be helpful to address changes
in family dynamics that often occur when living with ME/CFS. Counseling may
also help family members to provide better care for their loved ones suffering
from ME/CFS.
