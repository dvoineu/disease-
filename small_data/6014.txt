                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Names of the interventions being proposed for Strategy 1.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Name of the walking initiative or program being proposed for Strategy 2.



**Is the Letters of Intent information on page 27 under item 6 correct?**  
No, there is a small error related to the strategy number. Item 6 should read
as follows: _Name of the walking initiative(s) or program(s) being proposed
for Strategy ** _3_**._

**What size and type of Font should be used? What Font size can be used for
Tables?**  
Use size 12 Font for all narrative. There are no restrictions on the type of
font. Alternately, any legible size font can be used for tables and graphs.

**In the past, we have combined all of the required attachments into one
document with page numbers and a comprehensive table of contents. For this
NOFO, should we attach all of the documents listed on p. 46 separately?**  
Applicants may submit their application as a single, cohesive document or
individual PDF documents as outlined on page 46 of the NOFO. It is most
important that an applicant submits a table of contents that covers all of the
required components and clearly indicates where each section can be found.

**Does CDC require a template or format for the Narrative?**  
Page 27 of the NOFO describes the Project Narrative requirements. No specific
formatting is requested, nor is a template provided. The project narrative
required for the work plan as described on page 19 also does not require a
specific template or format.

**Is a Data Management Plan (p. 33) expected to be a separate document, or
should it be included within the text of the narrative?**  
The Data Management Plan must be included in the project narrative and will
count against the 20-page limit for the project narrative. It should be
labeled "Data Management Plan" and placed with the performance plan.

**Are there reporting requirements that are not noted in the NOFO (i.e. reach
and partner tables collected under CDC-RFA-DP12-1210)?**  
No, only requirements/expectations listed in NOFO DP18-1803 are applicable for
this funding opportunity.

**Does the budget narrative, references or the Data Management Plan count
against project narrative 20-page limit?**  
No, budget information, including its narrative and references, do not count
against the 20 page limit. The Data Management Plan should be included in the
project narrative and not be added as a separate document. The DMP is part of
the 20 page limit.

**Does the sample work plan that is to be included in the narrative have to be
12 font size, or can applicant use a smaller font size?**  
Applicant can use a smaller legible font size for the work plan.

**Can an applicant add a bibliography or list of references as an attachment,
outside the project narrative 20-page limit?**  
Yes, applicants can add separate attachments outside of the Project Narrative
20-page limit, such as a bibliography or a list of references.

**Can an applicant include a logic model(s) for the four strategies outside
the project narrative 20-page limit?**  
A logic model is not required. However, if applicant chooses to include a
logic model, it should ideally be included within the Project Narrative
20-page limit.  Information referenced outside the Project Narrative should
not be an expansion of the Project Narrative, but solely supportive
information for the Project Narrative. Attachments should not be used as a way
to extend/exceed page limits associated with the Project Narrative.

**In follow-up to the question asked regarding including the Data Management
Plan (DMP) within the 20-page project narrative, can you provide some
clarification on the level of detail that needs to be included?   Do all five
topics referenced need to be included in the narrative for each data source or
can some of that detail be attached?**  
If an applicant is proposing to collect only the BRFSS data associated with
the NOFO performance measures requirements, then a DMP is not required. A DMP
for this NOFO would only be needed if a new data set is being proposed to
address proposed outcome measures.

If applicant determines a DMP is not required, the applicant should include
one sentence from the following language in the Project Narrative:  "A DMP is
not being submitted for one or more of the following reasons (select only
those applicable):

1) Applicant is collecting  _only_  the required  _BRFSS data_ ;

2) Applicant is using other  _publically_  available data;

3) Applicant is only collecting data for  _program improvement, and not for
decision making or generalizability_ ;

4) Applicant proposes to utilize other  _available_  data sets."

If an applicant determines that a DMP is required, it is acceptable to include
very limited, basic information addressing the key components within the
Project Narrative and provide additional details only if and when an award is
granted. Detail beyond basic information may be provided in attachments, but
is not required at the time of application.

**Do letters of support count towards the allowable page limit?**  
No, letters of support, similar to Memorandum of Understanding, do not count
against project narrative 20-page limit and should be included in attachments
as described on page 46 of the NOFO.

**Can a list of acronyms be added to the list of attachments described on page
46 of the NOFO?**  
No, applicant is only allowed to _attach_ what is described on page 46 of the
NOFO _and_ the additional allowed items mentioned previously in the NOFO FAQ
webpage: bibliography and references. Applicant is expected within the Project
Narrative to include the full term followed by the acronym(s) that then can be
used throughout the narrative.

**Page 19 of the RFP mentions that applicants are expected to provide a
detailed project narrative and work plan for the first year of the project
period and then also "a high level plan in narrative form (no more than 3
pages in length) for subsequent years in support of NOFO outcomes as part of
the application package."  The FAQs repeat this language but do not make very
clear if this is supposed to be part of the 20-page limit. Also, does the
information on subsequent years need to be contained to a single section
labeled as such, or can the information be addressed throughout the
narrative?**  
A high level plan in narrative form (no more than 3 pages in length) for years
2-5 is to be included as part of the 20 page Project Narrative limit. The
information on years 2 through 5 can be addressed in a single section or
throughout the narrative, at the applicant's discretion, but should be labeled
to clearly indicate which project years are being covered or addressed.

**The HHS Checklist form in the grant application package in Grants.gov asks
in Part B, "Has a Public Health System Impact Statement for the proposed
program/project been completed and distributed as required?"  We are wondering
if this statement is required for our application.  Our sponsored programs
staff person found the information below online (see List of Additional
Requirements), which seems to indicate it is required only of "community-based
non-governmental organizations"--which we are not.  We do anticipate having
some sub-recipients that might be considered community-based non-governmental
organizations, however.  Can you please confirm whether or not a Public Health
System Impact Statement is required? **  
A Public Health System Impact Statement is based on Intergovernmental Review
(E.O. 12372) which does not apply to this program. Therefore A Public Health
System Impact Statement is not required for this NOFO.

**I am unable to determine where certain documents need to be attached. Is it
ok to submit the following items as "Other Attachments":  Table of Contents,
Assurances and Certifications, Report on Programmatic, Budgetary and
Commitment Overlap, Resumes, Position Descriptions, Letters of Support,
MOA/MOU?**  
It is fine to submit the documents listed in the question above under Other
Attachments. It is very important that your Table of Contents clearly indicate
where the various components of the application are located and/or how they
are organized. A list of acceptable attachments is provided on page 46 of the
NOFO.

**Is it ok to submit the CVs and Letters of Support in one file or do you want
them separate?**  
It is fine to submit them either way. It is very important that your Table of
Contents clearly indicate where everything is located, whether it be under one
attachment or a series of separate, distinctly labeled attachments.

**On page 46 of the NOFO, under H. Other Information, there isn 't a category
for allowing us to upload Appendices as attachments. It also states,
"Applicants may not attach documents other than those listed; if other
documents are attached, applications will not be reviewed". In the NOFO FAQ,
appendices are mentioned and it sounds like the are allowable. If so, what
category will we upload them in?**  
Appendices may be uploaded to the Other Attachments category. It is important
that your Table of Contents clearly indicate where the various components of
the application are located and/or how they are organized. A list of
acceptable attachments is provided on page 46 of the NOFO.

**Two of the FAQs seem to imply that applicants CAN include attachments not
listed on p. 46 of the NOFO. We have some charts that we would like to include
as attachments, but do not want our application to be tossed out for inclusion
of these. The application stands alone without them. They do not present new
information, but organize information scattered throughout in a way that makes
it easier to see and understand for a reviewer. My question is, are we allow
to attach things like this?**  
The charts described in the question could be included within the Project
Narrative, and counted within the 20 page limit for the Project Narrative, but
not as separate appendices. Applicants are expected to stay within the list of
acceptable attachments indicated on p. 46 of the NOFO.  There is one exception
to the list on page 46: Applicants may also add a separate attachment outside
of the Project Narrative 20-page limit for a bibliography or a list of
references. Further guidance about this and the one exception is available on
the FAQs page under the 'Application Process' tab.

**Page 25 of the NOFO states that applications are due by 11:59 pm on 4/2/18.
However, on thegrants.gov synopsis pageExternal it indicates 5pm as the due
time. Do we have until 11:59 pm to submit an application since the NOFO
indicates the later time?  **  
Yes. Applicants have until 11:59 pm on 4/2/18 to submit applications for the
DP18-1803 NOFO.

Funding and Budget

**Can funds be spent on leader, master training, or program materials for
arthritis appropriate evidence-based interventions (AAEBI) such as CDSMP,
Enhance Fitness, or Walk with Ease?**  
Yes, funds can be spent on leader, master training, and/or materials for
arthritis appropriate evidence-based interventions (AAEBI) such as CDSMP,
Enhance Fitness, or Walk with Ease. It is up to the applicant to decide,
within the NOFO parameters, how to allocate cooperative agreement funds to
support grant activities. Applicants should keep in mind, in making decisions
about what to support in NOFO applications, that the average award is expected
to be $280,000 annually and that funded projects are expected to have
statewide impact as measured via the BRFSS performance measures described in
the NOFO and be sustainable.

**Does the cost of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
questions come "out of" the 10% that can be spent on evaluation?**  
Yes, evaluation should not exceed 10% of the annual total budget, including
the ability to collect and use BRFSS data and partner with or within the state
health department if/as needed to accomplish NOFO activities.

**Can funds be used for food, incentives, leader stipends?**  
Applicants should review the HHS Grants Policy StatementCdc-pdf[1,355
KB]External on the HHS website. It provides specific details on allowable
costs on pages II-30 through II-43. Specific to this NOFO, meals/food and
incentives will not be allowed. Funds can be spent on leader, master training,
and/or materials for arthritis appropriate evidence-based interventions
(AAEBI) such as CDSMP, Enhance Fitness, or Walk with Ease.

**Should applicants budget for an annual grantee meeting?**  
Applicants can budget for a grantee meeting for the first year. CDC hopes to
hold a grantee meeting late in the first grant year.

**Should we submit an application for the ceiling of $500,000?**  
For the first year, CDC does not expect to have funding available to support
each individual award at $500,000, however, applicants may request up to this
amount to support their proposed strategies and activities. The average
expected award will most likely be around $280,000 per recipient. CDC's
project officers will work with each recipient in making appropriate changes
to the work-plan and budget should the award be less than the originally
submitted budget.

**Our current budget period started 7/1 and ends 6/30. The NOFO states that
the estimated award date is 6/29/18, rather than 7/1. Does this mean that the
budget period will run 6/29 through 6/28?**  
The NOFO stated an _estimated_ award date of 6/29/2018. The Notice of Award
that will be issued will indicate the official start date of 7/01/2018 for
budget and project period. Grant project period is from 7/01/2018 through
6/30/2023.

**Can applicants exceed the 10% limit for evaluation to account for BRFSS
costs that exceed or use most of this amount? With the optional arthritis
module, that is asked every other year, the BRFSS questions costs can be
significant, vary across states, and may leave insufficient funds to cover the
cost of staff needed to carry out evaluation activities. Given that CDC
efforts to have the questions added to the core will not be resolved by the
time applications are due, can you please advise as to how to proceed?**  
For the purpose of application submission, applicant should submit a budget
justification that includes the necessary costs for the needed BRFSS arthritis
questions and other evaluation activities. If the costs exceed the 10% limit,
applicant is to provide a strong justification as to why the additional
proposed costs are necessary and provide a detailed description of the costs.
CDC project officers will work with each awardee during the first six months
of Year 1 to resolve budget issues related to BRFSS questions and/or other
evaluation matters.

**Since some BRFSS questions are bi-annual does applicant need to fund annual
questions?**  
CDC is proposing to add the BRFSS Arthritis Management Module bi-annual
questions relevant to the NOFO to the BRFSS Core Arthritis questions offered
annually. We hope that this will be available for the 2019 BRFSS Core
questionnaire. We therefore expect that funding will be needed to support
annual Core questions only, if funding is required by the state health
department. An applicant will need to work with the state BRFSS coordinator to
determine how much support may be needed annually.

**Can the Program Manager 1.0 FTE position be divided among more than one
person?**  
Yes, more than one person can serve the roll of a program manager but cannot
exceed 1.0 FTE in total.

**Are we penalized if budget is less in the first year versus the following
years that make up the remaining four years of the overall 5-year project
period?**  
No, the applicant's budget is not being scored and therefore no penalty will
result if the applicant budgets less in the first year versus the following
years.

**Is a detailed budget required only for Project Year 1, or for all project
years?   If the former, do we need to include an estimate of total funding
needed each year for Project Years 2-5 (because there are required fields in
the SF424A Budget and Project Abstract/Summary Forms that ask for this)?  Or
can we enter "0" or "n/a" in those fields?**  
A detailed budget is only required for Project Year 1. Further, an applicant
will need to provide an estimated funding amount for year 2-5. That amount
should be about the same amount requested for year 1, based on an assumption
of the same-funding-level throughout the 5-year project period.

Staffing

 **Does CDC have specific expectations about staffing?**  
Applicant is to refer to pages 37 and 38 of the NOFO, under _Applicant 's
Organizational Capacity to Implement the Approach,_ and address the minimum
requirements described. These include: 1) having 1.0 FTE dedicated for a
program manager (can be more than one person) and; 2) identifying a process
for evaluation (which should include any staffing deemed necessary by the
applicant) not to exceed the 10% of annual total budget (including direct and
indirect costs) for the evaluation process. No additional staffing guidance is
provided. Applicant's overall budget, including a staffing plan, and project
activities are expected to produce a state-wide impact over the 5-year period.

**Can the Program Manager 1.0 FTE position be divided among more than one
person?**  
Yes, more than one person can serve the roll of a program manager but cannot
exceed 1.0 FTE in total.

**Can funds be spent on leader, master training, or program materials for
arthritis appropriate evidence-based interventions (AAEBI) such as CDSMP,
Enhance Fitness, or Walk with Ease?**  
Yes, funds can be spent on leader, master training, and/or materials for
arthritis appropriate evidence-based interventions (AAEBI) such as CDSMP,
Enhance Fitness, or Walk with Ease. It is up to the applicant to decide,
within the NOFO parameters, how to allocate cooperative agreement funds to
support grant activities. Applicants should keep in mind, in making decisions
about what to support in NOFO applications, that the average award is expected
to be $280,000 annually and that funded projects are expected to have
statewide impact as measured via the BRFSS performance measures described in
the NOFO and be sustainable.

**Can applicants exceed the 10% limit for evaluation to account for BRFSS
costs that exceed or use most of this amount? With the optional arthritis
module, that is asked every other year, the BRFSS questions costs can be
significant, vary across states, and may leave insufficient funds to cover the
cost of staff needed to carry out evaluation activities.Given that CDC efforts
to have the questions added to the core will not be resolved by the time
applications are due, can you please advise as to how to proceed?**  
For the purpose of application submission, applicant should submit a budget
justification that includes the necessary costs for the needed BRFSS arthritis
questions and other evaluation activities. If the costs exceed the 10% limit,
applicant is to provide a strong justification as to why the additional
proposed costs are necessary and provide a detailed description of the costs.
CDC project officers will work with each awardee during the first six months
of Year 1 to resolve budget issues related to BRFSS questions and/or other
evaluation matters.

**Within the FAQ webpage it indicates that funding can support a leader or
master trainer. Does "leader" mean the teacher of programs?**  
Leader or master trainer, as indicated under the Staffing section on the NOFO
FAQ webpage, refers to the individual that trains program instructors.
However, NOFO funds can be spent on AAEBI training or certification for
master/leader trainers and instructors/course leaders. As stated previously,
it is up to the applicant to decide, within the NOFO parameters, how to
allocate cooperative agreement funds to support grant activities. Applicants
should keep in mind that the average award is expected to be $280,000 annually
and that funded projects are expected to have statewide impact as measured via
the BRFSS performance measures described in the NOFO and be sustainable.

Eligibility

 **Who can apply for this NOFO?**  
This NOFO is available for full and open competition and any organization may
apply. Applicants should carefully review the NOFO requirements and
expectations for this funding opportunity.

**What is meant by "unrestricted" for the eligibility criteria?**  
Unrestricted eligibility means that this NOFO is available for full and open
competition and any organization type may apply. Applicants should carefully
review the NOFO requirements and expectations for this funding opportunity.

**Is there a limit to the number of applications you will accept from a single
institution?**  
As stated in the NOFO, CDC will issue no more than one award per state,
however, the NOFO has no limit on the number of applications that may be
submitted by an institution or organization.

**Is the expected 1.4% direct access to adults per year or over the five year
period?**  
Applicant is to demonstrate having **access** to a minimum of 1.4% of adults
in its state _at the time of application submission_ as described on page 52.

**To meet the 1.4% direct access expectation as defined on page 52, can an
applicant apply jointly with another organization?**  
Yes, applicant is expected to provide formal documentation of the partnership
and address the additional details described on page 36 about
stakeholders/collaborators/partners expectations.

**How does one determine 1.4% direct access?**  
This term is relevant for Strategy 1. At minimum, specifically for Strategy 1,
the applicant is expected to demonstrate existing capacity that ensures direct
access to at least 1.4% of total adults (18 and older) residing in the
applicant's state to disseminate Arthritis-Appropriate Evidence-Based
Intervention(s) and carry out related activities of this grant. For example,
if the applicant is a large employer, insurer, health care system, or health
service provider located in the state of Georgia, the applicant will employ,
insure, treat, or directly serve at least 109,000 adults in Georgia. There are
approximately 7.8 Million adult residents in Georgia per 2016 US Census Bureau
information, and 1.4% of 7.8 million is calculated to be approximately 109,000
adults and therefore indicative of the minimum number of adults to whom the
applicant should be able to disseminate the AAEBIs-related cooperative
agreement activities. Additionally, per this example, the applicant, based on
the nature of their relationship to the population as an employer, insurer,
health care system, or health service provider, would therefore have direct
access and sufficient capacity to reach and serve at least 109,000 adults in
the state. Applicants are not restricted to the organization types and roles
listed in the Georgia example, but should have comparable access and reach
into the adult population within a state.

**Can applicant apply jointly with a partner and combine the access to adults
for both to meet the 1.4% state-wide access to adults expectation?**  
Yes, an applicant can apply jointly and can combine the co-applicant's access
numbers to adults to meet the 1.4% state-wide access expectation. However,
only one organization can serve as the fiscal agent.

**Is it 1.4% state-wide access for each of the four strategies or a total of
1.4% for all four strategies?**  
The 1.4% minimum direct access is an expectation specifically for Strategy 1.
However, for all strategies, state-wide impact is expected.

**What is the difference between access and reach, are these two terms
interchangeable?**  
Applicant is to demonstrate having **access** to a minimum of 1.4% of adults
in its state at the time of application submission as described on page 52,
and describe intended **reach** to meet defined project milestones for the
first year and over the 5-year project period. Achievement of performance
measure outcome targets is expected within 5 years; therefore milestones
reflective of incremental progress should be set for years 1-4 leading up to
the achievement of the performance outcomes (as measured by the BRFSS survey
questions outlined in the NOFO) by the end of the 5-year cooperative
agreement.

**Can the audience size reached by radio ad spots meet the 1.4% direct access
expectation for Strategy 1?**  
No, this would not meet the definition of the 1.4% direct access expectation
intended for Strategy 1 and described on page 52, however, it may for Strategy
4.

Project Narrative

 **Does CDC require a template or format for the Narrative?**  
Page 27 of the NOFO describes the Project Narrative requirements. No specific
formatting is requested, nor is a template provided. The project narrative
required for the work plan as described on page 19 also does not require a
specific template or format.

**Is a Data Management Plan (p. 33) expected to be a separate document, or
should it be included within the text of the narrative?**  
The Data Management Plan must be included in the project narrative and will
count against the 20-page limit for the project narrative. It should be
labeled "Data Management Plan" and placed with the performance plan.

**Does the sample work plan that is to be included in the narrative have to be
12 font size, or can applicant use a smaller font size?**  
Applicant can use a smaller legible font size for the work plan.

**It appears that information about the outcome measures needs to be included
in three places throughout the application- the outcomes section, the
evaluation and performance measurement section, and the work plan. Given the
short page limit and the need to embed the work plan within that, the
redundancy of listing the outcomes multiple times will take up valuable space.
Can the information about the outcomes be streamlined or only included in
select sections? **  
The applicant is to submit a project Narrative that must include **all** of
the following headings (including subheadings as indicated): Background,
Approach, Applicant Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan,
Organizational Capacity of Applicants to Implement the Approach, and Work
Plan. The applicant may choose to refer to other sections of the Project
Narrative to save space/ reduce redundancy if it does not compromise the
Project Narrative headings and subheadings and their requirements.

**Can CDC provide clarification regarding the level of detail to be included
in the work plan as compared to the project narrative?   Does the work plan
need to be embedded within the narrative (for example: narrative description
of Strategy 1 (S1) activities followed by work plan chart for S1 activities)
or should it be presented as one contiguous plan? **  
The Project Narrative requires a separate subheading for the Work Plan,
therefore the Work Plan needs to be a distinct, contiguous subsection of the
narrative which includes: Background, Approach, Applicant Evaluation and
Performance Measurement Plan, the Organizational Capacity of Applicants to
Implement the Approach, and Work Plan. The NOFO provides a sample template of
the work plan. An applicant is not required to use the provided template, but
should capture the items provided in the template. The Work Plan should cover
the activities to occur in grant year 1. However, the project narrative should
cover the activities to occur in grant year 1 (in sufficient detail for
objective reviewers to understand and assess the merit of the plan) and a high
level plan (no more than 3 pages) for subsequent years. The applicant may
choose to refer to other sections of the Project Narrative to save space/
reduce redundancy if it does not compromise the Project Narrative headings and
subheadings and their requirements.

**On page 46 of the NOFO, optional attachments, outside of the project
narrative 20-page limit, include resumes, position descriptions, letters of
support, organization charts, MOAs, and MOUs. It states that "applicants may
not attach documents other than those listed; if other documents are attached,
applications will not be reviewed." Does this mean a project map cannot be
attached?**  
Similar to a previous answer provided regarding inclusion of a logic model, a
project map should ideally be included within the Project Narrative 20-page
limit. Information referenced outside the Project Narrative should not be an
expansion of the Project Narrative, but solely supportive information for the
Project Narrative. Attachments should not be used as a way to extend/exceed
page limits associated with the Project Narrative.

**Is there any possibility CDC could extend the page limit for the Project
Narrative, and/or allow applicant to include the work plan as an appendix?**  
Twenty pages are allotted to the Project Narrative, which includes 5 headings
(and subheadings): Background, Approach, Applicant Evaluation and Performance
Measurement Plan, Organizational Capacity of Applicants to Implement the
Approach, and Work Plan. There is no page length minimum for a section or
subsection. Although applicants are to use size 12 Font (any type) for all
narrative, any legible size font can be used for tables and graphs. The
applicant may choose to refer to other sections of the Project Narrative to
save space/ reduce redundancy if it does not compromise the Project Narrative
headings and subheadings and their requirements.  
Appendices can be used to supply other information. However, information
referenced outside the Project Narrative should not be an expansion of the
Project Narrative, but solely supportive information for the Project
Narrative. Attachments should not be used as a way to extend/exceed page
limits associated with the Project Narrative.

**In follow-up to the question asked regarding including the Data Management
Plan (DMP) within the 20-page project narrative, can you provide some
clarification on the level of detail that needs to be included?   Do all five
topics referenced need to be included in the narrative for each data source or
can some of that detail be attached?**  
If an applicant is proposing to collect only the BRFSS data associated with
the NOFO performance measures requirements, then a DMP is not required. A DMP
for this NOFO would only be needed if a new data set is being proposed to
address proposed outcome measures.

If applicant determines a DMP is not required, the applicant should include
one sentence from the following language in the Project Narrative:  "A DMP is
not being submitted for one or more of the following reasons (select only
those applicable):

1) Applicant is collecting _only_ the required _BRFSS data_ ;

2) Applicant is using other _publically_ available data;

3) Applicant is only collecting data for _program improvement, and not for
decision making or generalizability_ ;

4) Applicant proposes to utilize other _available_ data sets."

If an applicant determines that a DMP is required, it is acceptable to include
very limited, basic information addressing the key components within the
Project Narrative and provide additional details only if and when an award is
granted. Detail beyond basic information may be provided in attachments, but
is not required at the time of application.

Work Plan

 **Does applicant need to submit a work plan for first year only or for each
year?**  
The work plan provided on page 19 is an example of the type of information and
detail that should be submitted for Year 1, only. In addition, a Year 1
project narrative is expected. Project narrative for Year 1 should be provided
at the beginning of the work plan. For Years 2-5, the applicant is expected to
provide a high-level plan in narrative form (no specific format) and to not
exceed 3 pages in length. Cooperative agreement awardees will provide detailed
plans for subsequent years (i.e. years 2-5), as part of an annual performance
reporting process.

**What sections must be included in the work plan? Does an applicant need to
use the sample template included in the NOFO?**  
The NOFO provides a sample template of the work plan to demonstrate how an
applicant can capture and track annual progress of applicant's strategies and
activities toward meeting project outcome measures and targets. An applicant
is not required to use the provided template, but should capture the items
provided in the template.

**Does the sample work plan that is to be included in the narrative have to be
12 font size, or can applicant use a smaller font size?**  
Applicant can use a smaller legible font size for the work plan.

**Can CDC provide clarification regarding the level of detail to be included
in the work plan as compared to the project narrative?   Does the work plan
need to be embedded within the narrative (for example: narrative description
of Strategy 1 (S1) activities followed by work plan chart for S1 activities)
or should it be presented as one contiguous plan? **

The Project Narrative requires a separate subheading for the Work Plan,
therefore the Work Plan needs to be a distinct, contiguous subsection of the
narrative which includes: Background, Approach, Applicant Evaluation and
Performance Measurement Plan, the Organizational Capacity of Applicants to
Implement the Approach, and Work Plan. The NOFO provides a sample template of
the work plan. An applicant is not required to use the provided template, but
should capture the items provided in the template. The Work Plan should cover

reduce redundancy if it does not compromise the Project Narrative headings and
subheadings and their requirements.

Recipient Strategies and Activities

 **Is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) considered an "Other Self-
Management Intervention"?**  
Yes, any proposed other self-management intervention must have evidence of
effectiveness for its intended purpose (e.g., physical activity, pain
management, etc.) and have a delivery and implementation infrastructure in
place. Additionally, a proposed self-management intervention must be intended
for adults, and _primarily focused on physical activity, self-management
education, injury prevention (e.g. occupational), and/or weight-management
strategies_. DPP does meet these requirements and can be considered an "other
self-management intervention". (Refer to Attachment 1).

**What is meant by "address the unique needs and barriers of adults with
arthritis"?**  
CDC provides information about barriers faced by adults with arthritis on the
following webpage:
https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/comorbidities.htm. Most adults
face the following common barriers to physical activity:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Lack of time.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Competing responsibilities.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Difficulty finding an enjoyable activity.

Adults with arthritis may face the following additional, disease-specific
barriers:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Uncertainty about which types and amounts of activity are safe for their joints.

**Would Walk with Ease (group-led) and Walk with Ease (self-directed) programs
be considered one or two arthritis appropriate evidence based interventions
(AAEBIs) for Strategy 1?**  
For the purpose of the DP18-1803 NOFO, group-led and self-directed Walk with
Ease programs are considered as two separate interventions, therefore it would
be considered as two AAEBIs for Strategy 1.

**Under Strategy 3, are we required to promote a specific walking program
statewide, rather than promoting walking in general for people with
arthritis?**  
A specific program is not required for Strategy 3. An applicant can promote,
leverage and/or expand any walking initiative(s)/program(s) as long as they
are ongoing (i.e., not an one-time event) and sustainable effort(s) in their
state, inclusive of and appropriate for adults with arthritis and are likely
to have a state-wide impact. Some examples are provided in Attachment 2.

**Is the Worksite Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (WCDSMP) considered
a CDC recommended or promising arthritis appropriate evidence-based
intervention (AAEBI), or is it considered an other self-management
intervention?**  
WCDSMP, for the purpose of this NOFO, is considered an other self-management
intervention (OSMI) and may be utilized as directed under the guidance for
OSMIs in NOFO Attachment 1.

**Is the Walk with Ease (WWE) in Spanish considered a recommended or promising
arthritis appropriate evidence-based intervention (AAEBI), or is it considered
an other self-management intervention?**  
The WWE (Spanish), for the purpose of this NOFO, is considered an other self-
management intervention.

**Can an applicant implement Walk with Ease (WWE) for both Strategies 1 and
3?**  
Yes, but it is not required. An applicant can support any walking
initiative(s)/program(s) for Strategy 3 that are ongoing (i.e., not a one-time
event), inclusive of and appropriate for adults with arthritis, sustainable,
and likely to have a state-wide impact. Some examples are provided in
Attachment 2. Further, an applicant may implement any interventions that meet
the requirements provided in Attachment 1 of the NOFO to address Strategy 1.

**Is the Geri-Fit ® strength training physical activity program for older
adults considered an appropriate "other" self-management intervention under
this NOFO?**  
Yes.

**Can applicants focus their activities on major metropolitan areas or
MMSAs?**  
It is up to an applicant to decide how and where to focus their efforts and
applicants are expected to describe how their activities will yield state-wide
impact. This is a strategy that can be used. Applicant may opt to consult with
the state BRFSS coordinator for information about the state's sampling
procedures if applicant plans to take this approach.  
**How can I obtain technical support or information about webinars for the
promising or recommended arthritis appropriate evidence based interventions
(AAEBI)?**

Attachment 1 on the CDC NOFO webpages provides links for each AAEBI for more
information, including technical support for some.

**Does an applicant have to do all the activities indicated under each
Strategy?**  
Yes.

**In activity, 1.1, do we commit to making the dissemination plan using
language provided? Or is the language asking us to create our own for the
application based on the examples provided in Attachment 2?**  
Applicant is to propose their own dissemination plan to initiate, sustain, and
expand availability of selected AAEBIs using evidence based dissemination
strategies. Attachment 2 includes examples of appropriate evidence based
dissemination strategies for consideration when developing the applicant's own
dissemination plan.

**Can an applicant propose Silver Sneakers as a walking
initiative(s)/program(s) for Strategy 3?**  
Silver Sneakers is a fitness intervention that for the purposes of this NOFO,
can be considered as an other self-management intervention (OSMI). It is
appropriate for Strategy 1 related to the OSMI and sustainability expectation.

**Can applicant primarily target adults with arthritis 45 years and older
without excluding adults with arthritis 18-44 years, while achieving state-
wide impact as measured by the evaluation plan?  **

Yes, the applicant can primarily target adults with arthritis 45 years and
older without excluding adults with arthritis 18-44 years, and must
demonstrate direct access to a minimum of 1.4% of total adults in the state.

**Would an 8-week walking program that is offered across the state once a year
be considered "ongoing," and "sustainable," if it's been running for several
years? **  
Yes, a recurring statewide walking program such as the one described would be
considered sustainable and an appropriate walking initiative for NOFO Strategy
3.

**One of the questions and answers on the FAQ page states that Workplace CDSMP
(wCDSMP) is considered an "other self-management intervention". Has the wCDSMP
been released for implementation? Do you have any more information on this?**  
The wCDSMP can be selected as an "other self-management intervention" for
Strategy 1. Workplace CDSMP information can be found on the Self-Management
Resource Center webpageExternal (SMRC). Please contact SMRC at
smrc@selfmanagementresource.com for more information on the program's
availability and process of its implementation. It is also important to note
the guidance and limits related to OSMIs described in NOFO Attachment 2: If an
applicant opts to select an OSMI related to Strategy 1, among the
requirements, the applicant must "describe how the self-management
intervention is already being disseminated with an implementation
infrastructure in place (see Attachment 2 under Strategy 1.1 for examples) and
how it will leverage these existing activities."

Evaluation and Performance Measurement

 **Is it acceptable to include database support (e.g., data collection,
reporting to partners, cross-referral, provider feedback) in the budget? Would
that fall under the 10% evaluation portion? Can it be contractual?**  
Funding can be used to support a database for evaluation purposes and should
fall under the 10% evaluation funding limit. If the costs exceed the 10%
limit, applicant is to provide a strong justification as to why the additional
proposed costs are necessary to successfully deliver on the applicant's
proposed strategies, activities and outcomes, and provide a detailed
description of the costs. CDC will not require data collection beyond the
BRFSS measures described in the NOFO. It is at the discretion of the applicant
to propose data collection and evaluation activities beyond this. No
preferences or limitations are placed on the type of funding mechanism (.i.e.
contractual or other) to use to support evaluation activities. Applicant's
overall budget and project activities is expected to produce a state-wide
impact over the 5-year period. CDC project officers will work with each
awardee during the first six months of Year 1 to resolve budget issues, BRFSS
questions and/or other evaluation matters.

**Are there reporting requirements that are not noted in the NOFO (i.e. reach
and partner tables collected under CDC-RFA-DP12-1210).**  
No, only requirements/expectations listed in NOFO DP18-1803 are applicable for
this funding opportunity.

**Should we anticipate that CDC will have us develop an evaluation and
performance plan that will include data collection/reporting of program
capacity (i.e., reach counts- number of people counseled on physical activity,
number of patients referred to programs, etc.)?**  
No. CDC will work with awardees' submitted work plan, outcome measures and
performance measurement strategy based on the NOFO requirements and
expectations listed on pages 14-17 and 19-21. Additional requirements **will
not be imposed** on awardee during the grant cycle. However, CDC project
officers will work with awardees during the first 6 months of first grant year
to make adjustments as needed in the awardees originally proposed work plan
and evaluation and performance plan.

**What kind of data "counts" as requiring a data management plan?**  
Data is defined by the applicant under the Evaluation and Performance
Measurement section. If the applicant will collect data other than the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data as part of their evaluation
and performance measure plan, a Data Management Plan (DMP) must be submitted.
See web link for additional information:
https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additionalrequirements/ar-25.html.

**Can applicants exceed the 10% limit for evaluation to account for BRFSS
costs that exceed or use most of this amount? With the optional arthritis
module, that is asked every other year, the BRFSS questions costs can be
significant, vary across states, and may leave insufficient funds to cover the
cost of staff needed to carry out evaluation activities. Given that CDC
efforts to have the questions added to the core will not be resolved by the
time applications are due, can you please advise as to how to proceed?**  
For the purpose of application submission, applicant should submit a budget
justification that includes the necessary costs for the needed BRFSS arthritis
questions and other evaluation activities. If the costs exceed the 10% limit,
applicant is to provide a strong justification as to why the additional
proposed costs are necessary and provide a detailed description of the costs.
CDC project officers will work with each awardee during the first six months
of Year 1 to resolve budget issues related to BRFSS questions and/or other
evaluation matters.

**What is CDC using as the cut off point for severe joint pain for the BRFSS
question associated with the severe joint pain performance measure: "Please
think about the past 30 days, keeping in mind all of your joint pain or aching
and whether or not you have taken medication. DURING THE PAST 30 DAYS, how bad
was your joint pain ON AVERAGE? Please answer on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is
no pain or aching and 10 is pain or aching as bad as it can be?"**  
BRFSS cut point for determination of severe joint pain is a report of 7 or
higher on the 10 point scale.

**Since some BRFSS questions are bi-annual does applicant need to fund annual
questions?**  
CDC is proposing to add the BRFSS Arthritis Management Module bi-annual
questions relevant to the NOFO to the BRFSS Core Arthritis questions offered
annually. We hope that this will be available for the 2019 BRFSS Core
questionnaire. We therefore expect that funding will be needed to support
annual Core questions only, if funding is required by the state health
department. An applicant will need to work with the state BRFSS coordinator to
determine how much support may be needed annually.

**What are expectations for a large state as far as outcome measures and BRFSS
questions, and what if more than 10% of total budget is needed to conduct
evaluation activities?**  
The expectations regarding performance measures are the same, regardless of
state size and outcomes are based on changes in percentages and not absolute
numbers. If the costs exceed the 10% budget limit for the evaluation process,
applicant is to provide a strong justification as to why the additional
proposed costs are necessary and provide a detailed description of the costs.
CDC project officers will work with each awardee during the first six months
of Year 1 to resolve budget issues related to, BRFSS questions and/or other
evaluation matters.

**Data for some arthritis BRFSS questions will not be available for 2018, can
an applicant use 2019 BRFSS data as performance measures baselines?**  
Applicants may use 2017 BRFSS data for their baseline to report on performance
measures that are not on the BRFSS core survey. If 2017 data are not
available, applicants may use 2019 data for their baseline for these measures.

**Can applicants focus their activities on major metropolitan areas or
MMSAs?**  
It is up to an applicant to decide how and where to focus their efforts and
applicants are expected to describe how their activities will yield state-wide
impact. This is a strategy that can be used. Applicant may opt to consult with
the state BRFSS coordinator for information about the state's sampling
procedures if applicant plans to take this approach.

**Can an applicant combine years when looking at the BRFSS measures?
Especially since rural locations/disparate populations confidence bounds can
be larger than what is seen at the CDC/U.S. data level.**  
Applicant may not need to combine data years to develop credible estimates for
sub-populations given arthritis' high prevalence. If an applicant chooses to
combine data for baseline, the applicant would then need to combine years
throughout the 5-year project period to produce prevalence estimates. A 5-year
project period many not be enough time to capture adequate progress, using
combined years, especially given the delay in access to BRFSS data.

**If we are choosing to do a physical activity program should applicant
prioritize the outcomes measures CDC has supplied in the NOFO?**  
Yes, CDC expects the applicant to achieve and report on the first three (3)
outcome measures (OM1 - OM3) from the list of outcome measures on page 14-15,
as well as one (1) or more of the additional outcome measures (OM4 - OM6)
listed on page 15, as applicable to the applicant's proposed strategies and
activities. The applicant may also propose other outcome measures appropriate
for their proposed strategies and activities, and consistent with the intended
NOFO outcomes. The applicant has no limits on how many or what kind of other
outcome measures to propose.

**With the activities that are provided, does that mean CDC is not interested
in SMART objectives included in the work plan and narrative, or are those
strategies and activities as well as outcome measures all guidance for writing
objectives?**  
Applicants are encouraged to propose SMART strategies/objectives and aligned
activities to ensure that the objective panel reviewers have sufficient
information about what the applicant is proposing to properly assess the
application. Each strategy and activity described in the NOFO is expected to
be addressed by the applicant described on pages 7-10, but applicant is not
expected to reiterate the content. The applicant is expected to tailor and
provide greater detail for their own strategies and activities based on the
strategies and activities described in the NOFO. The strategies and activities
are to accomplish annual outcome measures and targets as described on pages
14-16.

**For the baseline and outcome measures, are we supposed to use crude
estimates or age-adjusted estimates?**  
An applicant can use either or both crude estimates and age-adjusted
estimates.

**Can or should the Year 1 milestones that an applicant writes into its work
plan be the same as the Short-term Outcomes listed on page 5 of the NOFO?**  
Yes they can be the same. However, ideally, Grant Year 1 (GY1) milestones
should reflect preliminary accomplishments or achievements that are expected
to occur in GY1 that, if achieved, will serve as indicators that the work plan
activities are on track and being successfully carried out to achieve short-
term and future outcomes.  
The short term outcomes themselves might be considered milestones towards
meeting mid-term outcomes. The short term outcomes listed in the NOFO are
expected to occur within approximately the first 2 years of the cooperative
agreement and help lead to the achievement of medium and long-term outcomes.
Milestones should be indicators of progress towards outcomes and a part of an
applicant's performance measurement plan. Your performance measurement plan
will drive the work plan. You must follow the instructions on pages 14 and 15
regarding outcome measures and minimum expectations for the performance
measurement plan. Applicant's proposed outcome measures will drive annual
milestones. The short-term outcomes described in the logic model are there to
help guide the applicant in creating their own short-term outcomes and
milestones. They are not required. Applicant can propose other or additional
short-term outcomes. The short-term outcomes listed on page 5 can also be used
as milestones, particularly for medium and long-term outcomes.

**Can applicant primarily target adults with arthritis 45 years and older
without excluding adults with arthritis 18-44 years, while achieving state-
wide impact as measured by the evaluation plan?**

Yes, the applicant can primarily target adults with arthritis 45 years and
older without excluding adults with arthritis 18-44 years, and must
demonstrate direct access to a minimum of 1.4% of total adults in the state.

**It appears that information about the outcome measures needs to be included
in three places throughout the application- the outcomes section, the
evaluation and performance measurement section, and the work plan. Given the
short page limit and the need to embed the work plan within that, the
redundancy of listing the outcomes multiple times will take up valuable space.
Can the information about the outcomes be streamlined or only included in
select sections?**  
The applicant is to submit a project Narrative that must include **all** of
the following headings (including subheadings as indicated): Background,
Approach, Applicant Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan,
Organizational Capacity of Applicants to Implement the Approach, and Work
Plan. The applicant may choose to refer to other sections of the Project
Narrative to save space/ reduce redundancy if it does not compromise the
Project Narrative headings and subheadings and their requirements.

**Based on the 1% improvements on each outcome measure over the 5 year grant
period: Can CDC confirm the 1% target is absolute and not relative? E.g., if
our baseline for percent of adults with arthritis who report no physical
activity is 35%, the target should be 34% and not 34.65%?**  
On pages 14 -15, outcome measures #2, #4 and #5 are expected to have targets
indicating a 1% increase over the 5-year grant period. The 1% increase or
greater if desired, should be indicated as an absolute number, or as a full 1
percentage point change (e.g., if baseline for percent of adults with
arthritis who report no physical activity is 35%, the target should be 34%,
not 34.65%).

**Regarding the Data Management Plan (DMP), does CDC expect a description of
how applicant will maintain, collect, distribute etc. data or is CDC looking
for a full-fledged DMP? If you are looking for a full Data Management Plan, is
there a template we could follow?**  
The DMP for the submission of this application should briefly address the
information described on page 16 section ii. under the fourth bullet. A full-
fledged DMP is not expected at this time. CDC and the recipient will spend the
first 6-months of year one making any changes or additions to the evaluation
and performance measurement plan, including DMP if applicable.

**In follow-up to the question asked regarding including the Data Management
Plan (DMP) within the 20-page project narrative, can you provide some
clarification on the level of detail that needs to be included?   Do all five
topics referenced need to be included in the narrative for each data source or
can some of that detail be attached?**  
If an applicant is proposing to collect only the BRFSS data associated with
the NOFO performance measures requirements, then a DMP is not required. A DMP
for this NOFO would only be needed if a new data set is being proposed to
address proposed outcome measures.

If applicant determines a DMP is not required, the applicant should include
one sentence from the following language in the Project Narrative:  "A DMP is
not being submitted for one or more of the following reasons (select only
those applicable):

1) Applicant is collecting  _only_  the required  _BRFSS data_ ;

2) Applicant is using other  _publically_  available data;

3) Applicant is only collecting data for  _program improvement, and not for
decision making or generalizability_ ;

4) Applicant proposes to utilize other  _available_  data sets."

If an applicant determines that a DMP is required, it is acceptable to include
very limited, basic information addressing the key components within the
Project Narrative and provide additional details only if and when an award is
granted. Detail beyond basic information may be provided in attachments, but
is not required at the time of application.

**How can I find out about current arthritis activities in my state? Who can I
contact in a state health department involved in arthritis state activities?**  
Every state may not have an arthritis program or an arthritis contact at the
state health department. CDC currently funds 12 states for arthritis
activities. State health department contacts and information for these 12
funded projects are available at:
https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/partners/funded-states.htm. You may also reach
out to the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD)
Representative Member to obtain information on other states' arthritis
contacts. To find the NACDD Representative Member go here -

**Does CDC have specific expectations about staffing?**  
Applicant is to refer to pages 37 and 38 of the NOFO, under _Applicant 's
Organizational Capacity to Implement the Approach,_ and address the minimum
requirements described. These include: 1) having 1.0 FTE dedicated for a
program manager (can be more than one person) and; 2) identifying a process
for evaluation (which should include any staffing deemed necessary by the
applicant) not to exceed the 10% of annual total budget (including direct and
indirect costs) for the evaluation process. No additional staffing guidance is
provided. Applicant's overall budget, including a staffing plan, and project
activities are expected to produce a state-wide impact over the 5-year period.

**Can the Program Manager 1.0 FTE position be divided among more than one
person?**  
Yes, more than one person can serve the roll of a program manager but cannot
exceed 1.0 FTE in total.

**Will an applicant be penalized if they list more AAEBIs in their letter of
intent than they write into their application submission?**  
No, changes can be me as long as they meet the requirements and expectations
of the NOFO.
