Respiratory disease outbreaks are a common public health problem and
investigating them can be a challenge. Determining which pathogen is the cause
(etiology) of an outbreak is critical to implementing appropriate control
measures. However, it can be difficult to determine which pathogen is causing
respiratory disease outbreaks as many pathogens could be the cause. Diagnostic
testing can also be complicated as sometimes the appropriate diagnostic test
may not be available locally or can be difficult to interpret.

CDC developed the following resources to assist public health professionals
and partners in investigating unexplained respiratory disease outbreaks
(URDO).
