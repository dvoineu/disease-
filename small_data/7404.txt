Other, less common symptoms include itchy skin, hives, and swelling of the eye
and joints 2,7,8. Sometimes, the symptoms of giardiasis might seem to resolve,
only to come back again after several days or weeks. Giardiasis can cause
weight loss and failure to absorb fat, lactose, vitamin A and vitamin B12
2,4,9-12.

In children, severe giardiasis might delay physical and mental growth, slow
development, and cause malnutrition 2,11,13-17.
