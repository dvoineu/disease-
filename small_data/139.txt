Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a rare and deadly disease in people and nonhuman
primates. The viruses that cause EVD are located mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.
People can get EVD through direct contact with an infected animal (bat or
nonhuman primate) or a sick or dead person infected with Ebola virus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Ebola vaccine
rVSV-ZEBOV (tradename "Ervebo") for the prevention of EVD. The rVSV-ZEBOV
vaccine has been found to be safe and protective against only the _Zaire
ebolavirus_ species of ebolavirus.

Ebola Exposure Calculator

![an icon of the Ebola virus](/vhf/ebola/images/ebola-app-thumb.png)

This mobile app estimates when a person with Ebola was exposed to the virus.
Knowing when someone was exposed to Ebola is essential to establish chains of
transmission. CDC in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory designed the app for field staff with variable levels of education
and knowledge of the natural disease progression of Ebola.
