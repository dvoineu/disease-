Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called
_Shigella_ (shih-GEHL-uh). Most who are infected with _Shigella_ develop
diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are
exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in 5 to 7 days. Some
people who are infected may have no symptoms at all, but may still pass the
_Shigella_ bacteria to others. The spread of _Shigella_ can be stopped by
frequent and careful handwashing with soap and taking other hygiene measures.
