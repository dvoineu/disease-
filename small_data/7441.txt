When hearing about hepatitis A, many people think about contaminated food and
water. However, in the United States, hepatitis A is more commonly spread from
person to person. Since March 2017, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH)
has been assisting multiple state and local health departments with hepatitis
A outbreaks, spread through person-to-person contact.

**The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent HAV infection**

Outbreak start date is defined at the state level and may represent the earliest onset date of an outbreak case (AR, AZ, UT), the left censor date for which cases are considered part of the outbreak based on the state outbreak case definition (AL, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, ID, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MI, MN, MO, MS, NV, NH, NJ, NC, OH, PA, SC, TN, VA, WA), or when a state declared a hepatitis A outbreak (NM, WV).

## CDC's Response

In response to all hepatitis outbreaks, CDC provides ongoing epidemiology and
laboratory support as well as support on vaccine supply and vaccine policy
development. When requested, CDC sends "disease detectives" to affected areas
to evaluate and assist in an outbreak response. CDC alerts other public health
jurisdictions of any increases in disease. All jurisdictions are encouraged to
be watchful for increases in hepatitis A cases. CDC also works with state and
local health officials to ensure hepatitis A vaccine is targeted to the
correct at-risk populations and that supply is adequate.

Postexposure Prophylaxis

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for unvaccinated people who have
been exposed to hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the last 2 weeks; those with
evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP.

PEP consists of:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Hepatitis A vaccine for people aged ≥12 months

NOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at

vaccinated should consult the child's health-care provider to confirm
vaccination status.

HAV Specimen Requests

State health departments wanting to submit specimens must contact CDC at
hepaoutbreaklab@cdc.gov for approval before shipping specimens to CDC.  Only
specimens that that have tested positive for anti-hepatitis A IgM and meet any
of the following criteria will be considered.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Specimen from a case patient in a county that has not yet reported a hepatitis A case in an at-risk population;
