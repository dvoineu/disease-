Page Summary

 **Who this is for** : Healthcare providers in the U.S. evaluating PUIs for
Ebola who are clinically stable AND do not have bleeding, vomiting, or
diarrhea

**What this is for** : Provides guidance on the processes for donning and
doffing PPE for healthcare workers and staff who are evaluating a PUI who is
clinically stable and does not have bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea

**How to use this, how it relates to other guidance documents** : Use this
guidance with frontline and assessment healthcare facilities described in
Interim Guidance for U.S. Hospital Preparedness for Patients Under
Investigation (PUIs) or with Confirmed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD): A Framework
for a Tiered Approach. It offers step-by-step processes for donning and
doffing PPE described in Identify, Isolate, Inform: Emergency Department
Evaluation and Management for Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola
Virus Disease _(EVD)_. These procedures do NOT apply to healthcare workers
caring for patients with confirmed Ebola or to healthcare workers caring for
PUIs who have bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, or who are clinically unstable
and/or will require invasive or aerosol-generating procedures (e.g.,
intubation, suctioning, active resuscitation). In those cases, use the
Guidance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) To Be Used By Healthcare
Workers during Management of Patients with Confirmed Ebola or Persons under
Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola who are Clinically Unstable or Have Bleeding,
Vomiting, or Diarrhea in U.S. Hospitals, Including Procedures for Donning and
Doffing PPE.

**Recommended PPE:**

While evaluating and managing PUIs who are clinically stable and do not have
bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea, healthcare providers should at a minimum

In this guidance, fluid-resistant means a gown that has demonstrated
resistance to water or a coverall that has demonstrated resistance to water or
synthetic blood. The specific test methods that assess resistance are listed
in Table 1. When purchasing gowns and coveralls, facilities should follow
specifications in this table to ensure they select recommended gowns and
coveralls.

Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms
in Blood and Body Fluids, which provides a more detailed explanation of the
scientific evidence and national and international standards, test methods,
and specifications for fluid-resistant and impermeable protective clothing
used in health care settings.

Facilities should ensure that healthcare providers are trained and able to
demonstrate competency in donning and doffing recommended PPE before being
allowed to care for PUIs. Facilities should also designate areas for PPE
donning and doffing as specified below (for more information, refer to the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Confirm that the doffing area is large enough to allow freedom of movement for safe doffing, has space for waste containers, a new glove supply, and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for use during the doffing process.

**Donning PPE**

**Donning PPE** - This donning procedure applies to PPE recommended for
evaluating and managing PUIs who are clinically stable and do not have
bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea. There is a lower risk of splashes and
contamination in these situations. An established protocol, combined with
proper training of the healthcare worker (HCW), helps to facilitate compliance
with PPE guidance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. **Remove Personal Clothing and Items** : The HCW should wear surgical scrubs. No personal items (e.g., jewelry [including rings], watches, cell phones, pagers, pens) should be worn under PPE or brought into the patient room. Long hair should be tied back. Eye glasses should be secured with a tie.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. **Inspect PPE Prior to Donning** : Visually inspect the PPE ensemble to ensure that it is in serviceable condition (e.g., not torn or ripped), that all required PPE and supplies are available, and that the sizes selected are correct for the HCW.

Ensure the cuffs are pulled over the sleeves of the gown _or_ coverall.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    8. **Put on Face Shield** : Put on full face shield over the surgical facemask to protect the eyes, as well as the front and sides of the face.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    9. **Verify** : After completing the donning process, the integrity of the ensemble should be verified by the HCW (e.g., there should be no cuts or tears in the PPE). The HCW should be comfortable and able to extend the arms, bend at the waist, and go through a range of motions to ensure there is sufficient range of movement while all areas of the body remain covered. A mirror in the room can be useful for the HCW while donning PPE.

**Doffing PPE**

**Doffing PPE** - PPE is doffed in the designated PPE removal area in the
healthcare facility. As with all PPE doffing, meticulous care should be taken
to avoid self-contamination. Place all PPE waste in a leak-proof infectious
waste container.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. **Inspect** : Inspect the PPE for visible contamination, cuts, or tears before starting to remove. If any PPE is visibly contaminated, disinfect by using an *EPA-registered disinfectant wipeexternal icon. If the facility conditions permit and appropriate regulations are followed, an *EPA-registered disinfectant spray can be used, particularly on contaminated areas.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. **Disinfect and Remove Outer Gloves** : Disinfect outer-gloved hands with either an *EPA-registered disinfectant wipe or ABHR. Remove and discard outer gloves, taking care not to contaminate inner gloves when removing the outer gloves. Dispose of outer gloves into the designated leak-proof infectious waste container.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. **Inspect and Disinfect Inner Gloves** : Inspect the inner gloves' outer surfaces for visible contamination, cuts, or tears. If an inner glove is visibly soiled, then disinfect the glove with either an *EPA-registered disinfectant wipe or ABHR, remove the inner gloves, perform hand hygiene with ABHR on bare hands, and don a new pair of gloves. If a cut or tear is seen on an inner glove, immediately review occupational exposure risk per hospital protocol. If there is no visible contamination and no cuts or tears on the inner gloves, then disinfect the inner-gloved hands with either an *EPA-registered disinfectant wipe or ABHR.
