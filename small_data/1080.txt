Powassan virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected tick. Although
still rare, the number of reported cases of people sick from Powassan virus
has increased in recent years. Most cases in the United States occur in the
northeast and Great Lakes regions from late spring through mid-fall when ticks
are most active. There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat
Powassan virus disease. Reduce your risk of infection from Powassan virus by
avoiding ticks.
