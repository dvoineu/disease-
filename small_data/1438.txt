Tobacco Use by Youth is Rising

E-cigarettes are the main reason

To make CDC health information more accessible to the public, more interesting
to the media, and more relevant to policymakers, CDC created  _Vital Signs_
--a monthly publication that uses concise and compelling data to communicate
vital health information on select topics. The CDC  _Vital Signs_  for
February 2019 reports youth tobacco product use increased during 2017-2018,
erasing past progress in reducing youth tobacco product use driven by a surge
in e-cigarette use.  
The  _Vital Signs_  report contains several products, including an MMWR Early
Release, social media messages, and a web page containing a video, a podcast,
and a fact sheet in English and Spanish.

Tobacco Use by Youth Is Rising: E-cigarettes Are the Main Reason

Tobacco product use among US youth is increasing. More than 1 in 4 high school
students and about 1 in 14 middle school students in 2018 had used a tobacco
product in the past 30 days. This was a considerable increase from 2017, which
was driven by an increase in e-cigarette use. E-cigarette use increased from
11.7% to 20.8% among high school students and from 3.3% to 4.9% among middle
school students from 2017 to 2018. No change was found in the use of other
tobacco products, including cigarettes, during this time.

Among youth:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are still the most commonly used tobacco product, ahead of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookah, and pipes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are the most commonly used product in combination with other tobacco products.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarette use is highest for boys, whites, and high school students.
