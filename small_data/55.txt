When it comes to weight loss, there's no lack of fad diets promising fast
results. But such diets limit your nutritional intake, can be unhealthy, and
tend to fail in the long run.

The key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight isn't about short-term
dietary changes. It's about a lifestyle that includes healthy eating, regular
physical activity, and balancing the calories you consume with the calories
your body uses.

Staying in control of your weight contributes to good health now and as you
age.
