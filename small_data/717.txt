CDC addresses the public health challenge of epilepsy through multiple
strategies. Healthcare providers, researchers, and other professionals can
learn more about this work below or on our program infographic.

**Our Purpose** - To improve the health and well-being of people with
epilepsy.

To accomplish this, the CDC Epilepsy Program

                      * Leads self-management research, program implementation, and dissemination, including 
                        * Collaborating with the Managing Epilepsy Well Network.
                        * Researching new self-management programs.
                        * Disseminating our work to partners so that people with epilepsy can benefit from our programs.
                      * Establishes and expands surveillance and data collection to 
                        * Describe the burden of epilepsy.
                        * Identify risk and protective factors.
                        * Evaluate prevention efforts.
                        * Prioritize program development.
                      * Prevents known risk factors for epilepsy by 
                        * Developing specific interventions (e.g., to detect cysticercosis infection).
                        * Promoting the health promotion and disease prevention efforts of others (e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke).
                      * Develops and promotes programs that create a more supportive environment for people with epilepsy by 
                        * Elevating epilepsy as a public health issue to motivate action.
                        * Complementing activities of key partners such as the Epilepsy Foundationexternal icon.
                        * Funding new programs, services, and activities.

CDC Epilepsy Program activities also fall within the National Center for
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's four key action areas of
Epidemiology and Surveillance, Environmental Approaches, Community-Clinical
Linkages, and Health Systems Interventions. Read more on the program's Fact
Sheet.

The CDC Epilepsy Program also creates features to bring attention to important
epilepsy issues and topics.

The CDC Epilepsy Program Logic Model pdf icon[PDF-140KB] shows how program
resources support different funded activities and the expected impacts these
activities will have in the short, medium, and long term.
