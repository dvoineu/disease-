# Quit for You, Quit for Your Loved Ones

![Collage of various people with smoking-related
illnesses](/tobacco/features/tips/quit-for-your-loved-ones/images/tips-
feature-2020.jpg)

While most Americans understand that smoking cigarettes causes serious health
effects, those who start smoking as youth or young adults may not realize
smoking-related disease can happen relatively early in life. Illness may also
cause them to miss important life milestones and can deeply affect the daily
lives of their family members and friends.

The new stories featured in this year's _Tips From Former Smokers_ ® ( _Tips_
®) campaign offer two perspectives: people living with serious illnesses
caused by smoking, and those caring for loved ones with smoking-related
disease. All of the people featured in this year's _Tips_ campaign share their
very personal accounts of courage and perseverance in new, hard-hitting ads
that will run nationwide beginning on March 23rd. Each ad encourages people
who smoke to quit for good, and to take advantage of free help by calling
1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) or 1-855-DÉJELO-YA (1-855-335-3569).

### Consider the Consequences

Asaad M. was 19 years old when his mother, Leah, found out she had colorectal
cancer caused by smoking. Leah had smoked cigarettes since she was 17 years
old.

Before his mom's diagnosis, Asaad had an internship in the fashion industry,
where he planned to pursue a career. But when it came to his decision to drop
out and care for Leah during her cancer treatment and recovery, he said it was
an easy choice.

"I was just like, 'Okay, we'll fight this together. That's that,'" he said.

Leah quit smoking after her cancer diagnosis. She now understands the impact
of her smoking. "It was ignorant for me to think I wasn't hurting anyone," she
said. "I never considered who would take care of me if I became ill."

Tonya M. was only 38 when her doctor told her she had heart failure due to her
smoking. She had started smoking as a teen, and by the time she was diagnosed,
she was smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.

In 2013, Tonya had a mechanical pump inserted inside her chest to help her
damaged heart move blood through her body. The pump uses batteries, so Tonya
needs to make sure that she always has battery power available or her pump
will not work. Her husband and children learned how to change the dressings
and batteries and respond to different alarms from the device.

"It went from me being their caregiver, to my husband and kids being mine,"
Tonya said. "Nobody wants that for their kids."

### Avoid Losing Things You Love

Geri M., now 58, loved her job as a mail carrier. In addition to time spent
with family, she enjoyed gardening, cooking, and dancing. However, she also
smoked menthol cigarettes--about a pack a day.

At age 44, Geri learned from her doctor that she had chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) from smoking. COPD is a condition that makes it
harder and harder to breathe and can cause death. She continued smoking after
her diagnosis, although she did try a few times to quit. About her smoking,
Geri said, "I didn't really take it seriously, and I should have."

By the time she quit at age 54, in 2015, her COPD had taken away her ability
to do many things she used to love, and she had to give up her job. She
regrets starting to smoke and wishes she had quit sooner.

Michael F. and his wife, Edna, had many adventures planned--even after he was
diagnosed at age 47 with COPD because of his smoking. They bought a boat and a
camping trailer they took sightseeing when Michael got time away from his
stressful, high-powered job.

Still, Michael kept smoking until his left lung collapsed when he was 51. He
had to have surgery and finally quit smoking. His COPD gradually got worse,
and Michael was forced to quit his job. Realizing that he wouldn't be able to
keep up with his travel plans, either, he and Edna sold the boat and the
trailer.

To people who may not feel ready to quit, Michael advises, "Think about all
you'll have to give up and ask yourself if it's really worth it. I can tell
you: it isn't."

### Heed the Hard Lessons

Denise H. has been married to Brian H., who has appeared in other _Tips_ ads,
for 45 years. Denise never smoked, but her parents had, so the fact that Brian
smoked didn't faze her at first.

"There wasn't a lot of information in those days about how dangerous
cigarettes were," she said.

Beginning with Brian's heart attack at age 35, Denise has cared for him
through several health challenges due to his smoking: COPD, heart bypass
surgery, a heart transplant, lung cancer, and the removal of part of his lung.

Rebecca C., who smoked for 26 years before quitting, has Buerger's disease, a
condition almost exclusively caused by smoking. Like COPD, Buerger's disease
doesn't go away, but quitting smoking can help slow it down. Rebecca had
swelling and blockage in the blood vessels of her right foot, which led to the
amputation of all five of the toes on that foot. After the surgery, she had to
re-learn how to balance while walking, especially on stairs.

Rebecca knows she needs to stay smokefree: "I won't go back to smoking again.
I can't; I don't want to lose any more."

Quitting now could mean that you don't have to give up the things that people
like Rebecca, Geri, Michael, and Tonya once took for granted.

### Take a Lesson

Every one of the people featured in the _Tips_ campaign wants to tell others
who smoke: quit now--for your health, your loved ones, your future.

As Geri said, "if I can help at least one person quit, then I've turned my
curse into a blessing."

### Resources to Help You Quit

People who stop smoking can reduce their risk for disease and early death. The
health benefits are greater for those who quit smoking at a younger age, but
quitting at any point will benefit your health. The following resources can
help you quit smoking:
