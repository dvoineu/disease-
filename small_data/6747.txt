# Men and Stroke

**Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in men** , killing almost the
same number of men each year as prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease
combined.1 Stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability2 and is more
common in younger men under age 44 than in younger women.3

**These facts are alarming, but there is good news: about 4 in 5 strokes are
preventable.** 4 That's why it's important to know your risk for stroke and
take action to reduce the risk. And you can learn more about how CDC and its
partners are leading programs to help prevent stroke.

# What is a stroke?

A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, happens when blood flow to an area
of the brain is cut off. When brain cells are starved of oxygen, they die.
Stroke is a medical emergency. It's important to get treatment as soon as
possible (see sidebar). A delay in treatment increases the risk of permanent
brain damage or death.

# What puts men at risk for stroke?

**Hypertension, also called high blood pressure,** is a main risk factor for
stroke. About 1 in 3 men have stage 2 hypertension (having a blood pressure
greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg), and more than half do not have it under
control.5

Other risk factors for stroke include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Smoking.** Smoking damages blood vessels, which can cause a stroke. About 1 in 6 men smoke.6 Men are also more likely to be smokers than women.6

It also increases levels of triglycerides, a form of fat in your blood that can harden your arteries. Men are more likely than women to drink too much alcohol.9

Only 1 in 4 men gets enough physical activity, including muscle-strengthening exercises, according to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americansexternal icon.10 In 2017, fewer than 1 out of 3 men met the guidelines (for aerobics and muscle strengthening).11

# Why are African American men at higher risk for stroke?

![Adrian Cushenberry and her family.](/stroke/images/adrian-cushenberry-
family.jpg)

Active, healthy, and just 49 years old, Adrian thought he was the last person
who needed to think about stroke. But Adrian did not realize that he had an
increased risk of stroke due to family history. Read Adrian's story.

Almost half of African Americans have a risk factor that can lead to a
stroke.5
