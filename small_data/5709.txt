## What is aortic aneurysm?

An aortic aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that
carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso.

Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a  **dissection**.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a  **rupture**.

## What are the types of aortic aneurysm?

Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms

A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally
likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with
increasing age.4

Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden
injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as
Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic
aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and
older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among white people than
among black people.5

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened
arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6

Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual
does have symptoms, they can include the following:

Other Types of Aneurysms

Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the
brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms--those found in arteries other
than the aorta--can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees.
These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms,
but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow
through the artery.

## What are the risk factors for aortic aneurysm?

Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also
increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior
related to aortic aneurysm.

Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your
family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your
risk.

## How are aortic aneurysms treated?

The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are  **medicines**  and
**surgery**. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic
aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.
