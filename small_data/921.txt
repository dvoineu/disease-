Sometimes these infections can be confused with spider bites.

Do not pick at or pop the sore.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Cover possible infections with clean, dry bandages until you can be seen by a healthcare provider (e.g., doctor, nurse, athletic trainer).

Prevention for Athletes

In addition to practicing good personal hygiene, athletes and visitors to
athletic facilities should also:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Keep your hands clean by washing often with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Soap and water is preferred if hands are visibly soiled. At a minimum, hands should be cleaned before and after playing sports and doing activities such as using shared weight-training equipment, caring for wounds, and after using the toilet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Shower immediately after exercise, and do not share bar soap or towels.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wash your uniform and clothing after each use. Follow the clothing label's instructions for washing and drying. Drying clothes completely in a dryer is preferred.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wear protective clothing or gear designed to prevent skin abrasions or cuts.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Cover skin cuts and wounds with clean, dry bandages or other dressings recommended by your healthcare provider (e.g., athletic trainer, team doctor) until healed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for when and how often to change your bandages and dressings.



**Do not share items that come into contact with your skin**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Avoid sharing personal items such as towels and razors that contact your bare skin.

Why does MRSA spread among athletes?

MRSA might spread easily among athletes because athletes:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Have repeated skin-to-skin contact.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * May have cuts and abrasions that if left uncovered makes spread easier and also may allow MRSA to enter and cause infection. Share items and surfaces that come into direct skin contact.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Are sometimes not able to shower or wash hands after exercise or after using shared equipment.

How to Prevent Spreading MRSA

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Cover your wounds. Keep wounds covered with clean, dry bandages until healed. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions about proper care of the wound. Pus from infected wounds can contain MRSA so keep the infection covered to help prevent spread to others. Bandages and tape can be thrown away with the regular trash.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Do not try to treat the infection yourself by picking or popping the sore.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Clean your hands often. You, your family, and others in close contact should wash their hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub, especially after changing the bandage or touching the infected wound. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly soiled.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Do not share personal items. Personal items include towels, washcloths, razors and clothing, including uniforms.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wash used sheets, towels, and clothes with water and laundry detergent. Use a dryer to dry them completely. Wash clothes according to manufacturer's instructions on the label. Clean your hands after touching dirty clothes.

Athletes That Are Most At Risk

Skin infections, including MRSA, are most commonly reported among athletes in
sports with a lot of physical contact. This includes wrestling, football, and
rugby. However, MRSA infections have been reported among athletes in other
sports such as soccer, basketball, field hockey, volleyball, rowing, martial
arts, fencing, and baseball.

Even though some sports involve only small amounts of physical contact, MRSA
might spread before or after participation, such as in the locker room. Anyone
participating in organized or recreational sports should be aware of the signs
of possible skin infections and follow prevention measures.
