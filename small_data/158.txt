African Trypanosomiasis, also known as "sleeping sickness," is caused by
microscopic parasites of the species _Trypanosoma brucei_. It is transmitted
by the tsetse fly ( _Glossina_ species), which is found only in rural Africa.
Although the infection is not found in the United States, historically, it has
been a serious public health problem in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa.
Currently, about 10,000 new cases each year are reported to the World Health
organization; however, it is believed that many cases go undiagnosed and
unreported. Sleeping sickness is curable with medication, but is fatal if left
untreated.
