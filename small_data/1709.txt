There are several treatment regimens recommended in the United States for
latent TB infection _._ The medications used to treat latent TB infection
include the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Isoniazid (INH)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Rifapentine (RPT)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Rifampin (RIF)

These medications are used on their own or in combination, as shown in the
table below.

CDC and the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA)
preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent
TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy.
Short course regimens include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * 12-Dose Regimen for Latent TB Infection- Medication Tracker and Symptom Checklistpdf icon

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Four months of daily rifampin (4R)pdf icon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Three months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin (3HR)

Short-course treatment regimens, like 3HP and 4R, are effective, safe, and
have higher completion rates than longer 6 to 9 months of isoniazid
monotherapy (6H/9H). Shorter, rifamycin-based treatment regimens generally
have a lower risk of hepatotoxicity than 6H and 9H.

If short-course treatment regimens are not a feasible or an available option,
6H and 9H are alternative, effective latent TB infection treatment regimens.
Although effective, 6H and 9H have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment
completion rates than most short-term treatment regimens.

All treatment must be modified if the patient is a contact of an individual
with drug-resistant TB disease. Clinicians should choose the appropriate
treatment regimen based on drug susceptibility results of the presumed source
case (if known), coexisting medical conditions (e.g., HIVexternal icon), and
potential for drug-drug interactions. Consultation with a TB expert is advised
if the known source of TB infection has drug-resistant TB.

*Isoniazid (INH) is formulated as 100 mg and 300 mg tablets.  
†Rifapentine (RPT) is formulated as 150 mg tablets in blister packs that
should be kept sealed until use.  
‡Intermittent regimens must be provided via directly observed therapy (DOT),
that is, a health care worker observes the ingestion of medication.  
§Rifampin (rifampicin; RIF) is formulated as 150 mg and 300 mg capsules.  
‖The American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges that some experts use RIF at
20-30 mg/kg for the daily regimen when prescribing for infants and toddlers

Jackson MA, Long SS, eds. _Red Book: 2018 Report of the Committee on
Infectious Diseases_. 31st ed. Itasca, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics;

¶The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an INH dosage of 10-15 mg/kg
for the daily regimen and 20-30 mg/kg for the twice weekly regimen.
