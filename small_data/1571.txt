## STD Surveillance Network

> In 2019, CDC announced the availability of fiscal year 2019 funds for a
> competitive cooperative agreement for the STD Surveillance Network
> (SSuN)external icon. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to
> implement new and proven approaches to community-based enhanced and sentinel
> surveillance that more fully integrates surveillance of STDs, HIV co-
> morbidity and monitors selected demographic and behavioral data important to
> informing STD prevention and control activities.

Systematic, ongoing collection of patient-level information to monitor the
occurrence of, and factors associated with, STDs is the foundation upon which
STD control programs are based. Reporting to CDC is limited and does not
provide some information needed to characterize STDs and co-occurring
epidemics, or to identify opportunities and gaps in sexual health and STD-
related, high impact HIV prevention. The SSuN Cooperative Agreement addresses
these and related STD surveillance priorities.

Priority strategies and activities include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Sentinel surveillance of patients presenting for care in specialty STD clinics
