                                                                                                                                * Call your doctor immediately if you suspect Zika.

##### Zika symptoms

Most people with Zika don't know they have it. The illness is usually mild
with symptoms lasting about a week. The most common symptoms are:

                                                                                                                                * Red eyes
                                                                                                                                * Fever
                                                                                                                                * Rash
                                                                                                                                * Joint pain

##### Pregnant? Trying to conceive?

Zika is linked to birth defects. Pregnant women should not travel to any area
with Zika outbreaks. If your partner travels to these areas, either use
condoms or don't have sex for the rest of your pregnancy. If you are trying to
become pregnant, talk to your doctor about your plans.
