Excluding Athletes from Participation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * If sport-specific rules do not exist, in general, athletes should be excluded if wounds cannot be properly covered during participation. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The term "properly covered" means that the skin infection is covered by a securely attached bandage or dressing that will contain all drainage and will remain intact throughout the activity. If wounds can be properly covered, good hygiene measures should be stressed to the athlete such as performing hand hygiene before and after changing bandages and throwing used bandages in the trash.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * A healthcare provider might exclude an athlete if the activity poses a risk to the health of the athlete (such as injury to the infected area), even though the infection can be properly covered.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Athletes with active infections or open wounds should not use whirlpools, therapy pools, and other water facilities like swimming pools until infections and wounds are healed.
