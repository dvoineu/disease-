When someone is having a stroke, every minute counts. Just as putting out a
fire quickly can stop it from spreading, treating a stroke quickly can reduce
damage to the brain. If you learn how to recognize the telltale signs of a
stroke, you can act quickly and save a life--maybe even your own.

Coverdell Stroke Program: Ensuring That All Americans Receive the Highest-
Quality Care

_Published October 27, 2015_

The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program, implemented by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, tracks and measures acute stroke care in
order to improve the quality of care, from first contact with emergency
medical services to the hospital and after the patient returns home from the
hospital. The program works to improve stroke care nationwide and reduce
stroke complications and deaths, particularly among those with the highest
burden.

Stroke Patients

_Published April 26, 2016_

As the lead neurologist for the Coverdell Stroke Program in Georgia, Dr.
Michael Frankel engages hospitals to participate in Georgia's stroke registry.
Participating hospitals better connect the continuum of care so that
physicians have more information to make the right decisions every time. The
data show that stroke death rates are lower in the communities served by
hospitals that embrace practices supported by Coverdell.

Prince Quire's Stroke Story

_Published October 27, 2015_

Every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a stroke. One of those people was
Prince Quire, who is African American. At only 39 years old, he was younger
than the typical stroke patient, but EMTs know that a stroke can happen at any
age. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death for all Americans, including
African Americans, but African Americans are twice as likely to have a stroke
as whites are.
