Pandemics happen when new (novel) influenza A viruses emerge which are able to
infect people easily and spread from person to person in an efficient and
sustained way. The United States is NOT currently experiencing an influenza
pandemic. CDC influenza programs protect Cdc-pdf[1.1 MB, 2 pages, 508] the

when a new flu virus emerges that can infect people and spread globally.
