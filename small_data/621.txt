Mission

CDC works 24/7 to protect America from health, safety and security threats,
both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are
chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack,
CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.

CDC increases the health security of our nation. As the nation's health
protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. To
accomplish our mission, CDC conducts critical science and provides health
information that protects our nation against expensive and dangerous health
threats, and responds when these arise.

Pledge to the American People

                      1. Be a diligent steward of the funds entrusted to our agency
                      2. Provide an environment for intellectual and personal growth and integrity
                      3. Base all public health decisions on the highest quality scientific data that is derived openly and objectively
                      4. Place the benefits to society above the benefits to our institution
                      5. Treat all persons with dignity, honesty, and respect
