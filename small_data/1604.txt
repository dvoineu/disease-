While sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) affect individuals of all ages,
STDs take a particularly heavy toll on young people. CDC estimates that youth
ages 15-24 make up just over one quarter of the sexually active population,
but account for half of the 20 million new sexually transmitted infections
that occur in the United States each year. The resources on this page provide
information about the impact of STDs on youth as well as resources for
reaching this population.
