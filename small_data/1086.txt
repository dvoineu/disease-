Babesiosis is caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells and
are spread by certain ticks. In the United States, tickborne transmission is
most common in particular regions and seasons: it mainly occurs in parts of
the Northeast and upper Midwest and usually peaks during the warm months.
Although many people who are infected with _Babesia_ do not have symptoms, for
those who do effective treatment is available. Babesiosis is preventable, if
simple steps are taken to reduce exposure to ticks.



Babesia microti _is transmitted by the bite of infected_ Ixodes scapularis
_ticks --typically, by the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of
a poppy seed. An_ Ixodes scapularis _nymph is shown on the face of a penny.
