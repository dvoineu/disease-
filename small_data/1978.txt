According to the U.S. Energy Information Administrationexternal icon, the
average U.S. electricity customer was without power for 250 minutes and
experienced 1.3 outage in 2016. A power outage can disrupt medical services,
close pharmacies, and create a life-threatening predicament for the over 2.5
million peopleexternal icon who rely on electric-powered medical equipment.
Prepare for a prolonged blackout with an emergency power plan and back up and
alternative power sources for your cellphone, refrigerator, and medical
equipment.
