Facts about Teen Dating Violence

Teens often think some behaviors like teasing and name-calling are a "normal"
part of a relationship, but these behaviors can become abusive and develop
into serious forms of violence.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Nearly 1 in 11 female and about 1 in 15 male high school students** report having experienced physical dating violence in the last year
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **About 1 in 9 female and 1 in 36 male high school students** report having experienced sexual dating violence in the last year

Unhealthy or violent relationships can have severe short and long-term effects
on a developing teen. For example, youth who are victims of TDV are more
likely to:

Teen Dating Violence is Preventable

Supporting the development of healthy, respectful, and nonviolent
relationships can help reduce the occurrence of TDV and prevent its harmful
effects. During the pre-teen and teen years, it is important for youth to
begin learning the skills needed to create and maintain healthy relationships.
These skills include things like how to manage feelings and how to communicate
in a healthy way.

CDC developed _Dating Matters ®: Strategies to Promote Healthy Teen
Relationships_ to stop teen dating violence before it starts. It focuses on
teaching 11-14-year-olds healthy relationships skills and includes sections
for kids, parents, schools, and neighborhoods. Visit the Dating Matters
