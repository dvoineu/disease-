quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2019, require
only 1 dose for 2019–20. The 2 previous doses of influenza vaccine do not need
to have been administered in the same season or consecutive seasons. Those who
have not previously received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza
vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2019, or whose previous influenza
vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses for 2019–20. The interval
between the 2 doses should be ≥4
