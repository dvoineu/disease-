Biomonitoring is the direct measurement of people's exposure to toxic
substances by measuring the substances or their metabolites in human
specimens, such as blood or urine. Biomonitoring measurements provide health-
relevant assessments of exposure because they indicate the combined amount of
the chemical that actually gets into people from all environmental sources
(for example, air, soil, water, dust, food). Biomonitoring efforts help
individuals determine the types of environmental chemicals that people have
been exposed to, the amount of those chemicals that actually gets into their
bodies, and the concentrations of chemicals in their bodies that may be
related to adverse health effects. Water-related biomonitoring data and
statistics are highlighted below.

CDC's _National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals_ provides
an ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's exposure to environmental
chemicals using biomonitoring. Fourth Report 2009 Cdc-pdf[PDF - 530 pages]
summarizes CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
biomonitoring data from 1999-2004. It also presents first-time exposure
information for 75 of the 212 chemicals included in the report. The data are
analyzed separately by age, sex and race/ethnicity groups.
