Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Most skin
cancers are caused by exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. People who
have a close relative (parent, sibling, or child) with a specific type of skin
cancer called melanoma may be at greater risk of developing the disease than
the general population. The best way for people to prevent skin cancer is to
protect themselves from the sun.
