CDC-INFO is experiencing a very high number of calls and emails. Wait times
for inquiries on all topics are longer than usual.

**If you are a healthcare provider with an urgent inquiry, or a member of the
general public with an urgent information need, please call** instead of
sending through the form.

**Due to the extremely high volume of inquiries, CDC is working to assist
those with the most urgent information needs. Many general public inquiries
submitted via the webform may not receive a reply from CDC-INFO**.

    * If you have general questions about COVID-19, please see the CDC's Coronavirus Disease 2019 FAQ page for timely information instead of submitting an email. This is an evolving situation, and CDC will provide information on our website as it becomes available.
    * You may also access CDC's online Coronavirus Self-Checker tool (click on the Self-Checker button). This tool can help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care if you or someone you're caring for may be sick with COVID-19.
    * You can also visit the CDC website for answers to questions on several other health topics.
