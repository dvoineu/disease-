What is the process for submitting specimens to CDC infectious diseases
laboratories?

CDC accepts specimens from state public health laboratories and other federal
agencies. Specimens from private healthcare providers and institutions must be
submitted to the state, county, or city health department laboratory for
processing.

Private citizens, health practitioners, and/or hospitals must contact their
county or city health department to submit specimens. If the local health
department is unable to make a determination on where and how to submit a
specimen, it will forward the specimen to the state health department.

A completed Form 50.34 CDC Specimen Submission Form must be supplied with each
specimen received at CDC (one specimen per form). If a submitter is sending in
a large number of specimens, the submitter may work with CDC infectious
diseases laboratories to submit specimens using a batch form.

For help with submitting specimens to a CDC lab, visit the Infectious Diseases
Specimen Submission IDSS Website or contact the IDSS Help Desk. The IDSS Help
Desk is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday through Friday (closed on federal
holidays).

How can I get a copy of a birth, death, marriage or divorce certificate?

Go to the National Center for Health Statistics' Where to Write for Vital
Records Website, then click on the state or area where the birth, death,
marriage, or divorce occurred. To obtain foreign birth or death certificates

speaker.

To request a CDC representative for a handwashing demonstration, career day,

types of events need 4 weeks advance notice.
