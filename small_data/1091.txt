Tularemia takes many forms--Learn the symptoms

Tularemia is a disease that can infect animals and people. Rabbits, hares, and
rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during
outbreaks. People can become infected in several ways, including:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Tick and deer fly bites
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Skin contact with infected animals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Drinking contaminated water
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Inhaling contaminated aerosols or agricultural and landscaping dust
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Laboratory exposure

In addition, people could be exposed as a result of bioterrorism.

Symptoms vary depending how the person was infected. Tularemia can be life-
threatening, but most infections can be treated successfully with antibiotics.

Steps to prevent tularemia include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Using insect repellent
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wearing gloves when handling sick or dead animals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Avoiding mowing over dead animals

In the United States, naturally occurring infections have been reported from
all states except Hawaii.
