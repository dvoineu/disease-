### Zika Travel Recommendations by Traveler Type and Country Category

Know before you go! Zika continues to be a problem in many parts of the world.
There is no vaccine to prevent infection. Zika is spread mostly by the bite of
an infected _Aedes_ species mosquito ( _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ ).
Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection during
pregnancy can cause certain birth defects.

Your decision to delay or cancel travel is personal and complex. In making
this decision, consider your travel destination and your ability to protect
yourself from mosquito bites. CDC recommends that pregnant women and couples
planning a pregnancy within the next 3 months consult with a health care
provider in making this decision.

1These countries have a potential risk of Zika, but we do not have accurate
information on the current level of risk. As a result, detection and reporting
of new outbreaks may be delayed.

2Because _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes (the mosquitoes that most commonly spreads
Zika) are present in these countries, Zika has the potential to be present,
along with other mosquito-borne infections. Detection and reporting of cases
and outbreaks may be delayed.

3No _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes (the mosquitoes that most commonly spreads
Zika) have been reported in these countries. However, other _Aedes_ species
mosquitoes have been known to spread Zika, and these may be present.
