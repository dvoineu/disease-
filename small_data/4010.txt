### Family Coordinator Asthma Education Program

**Article Citation:**  
Bonner, S, Zimmerman BJ, Evans D, Irigoyen M, Resnick D, Mellins RB. An
individualized intervention to improve asthma management among urban Latino
and African-American families. Journal of Asthma 2002;39(2):167-79.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Classroom and home

**Target Population:**  
Urban Latino and African-American families with a child with asthma

**Program Description:**  
This study hypothesized that an educational intervention based on a readiness
model would lead to improved health outcomes among patients with asthma. This
individualized asthma education intervention, based on the asthma self-
regulation model, comprised four sequential phases of patient readiness to
manage asthma: 1) asthma symptom avoidance, 2) asthma acceptance, 3) asthma
treatment compliance, and 4) asthma self-regulation.

Baseline interviews were conducted in participants' homes and families were
randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Control families received
usual medical care. Patient education was delivered by a family coordinator, a
college educated, bilingual, social services-oriented individual, who acted as
a behavioral change agent. Educational workshops and individualized counseling
sessions used an asthma diary as a primary intervention tool. The family
coordinator conducted three group educational workshops at 1-month intervals.
The workshops followed the learning sequence identified in the asthma self-
regulation model. In the first workshop, families were trained to use asthma
diaries and peak flow meters. Patients were required to monitor peak flow,
triggers, symptoms, medications, and side effects. The family coordinator
regularly called families to discuss their diary records. The second workshop
used patients' diary records as illustrations of the relative effectiveness of
controller medicines over rescue/quick-relief drugs in preventing asthma
symptoms over time. The strategy of using patients' own diaries as evidence of
the efficacy of control medicines helped overcome patients' preference for
rescue/quick-relief drugs. The third workshop described asthma management as a
two-pronged effort of medications and trigger control. Again, patients' own
diary records of fluctuations in asthma were shown as cues to step up
medications according to their action plans. In addition, the family
coordinator visited each family at home to assess the reliability of the diary
with a spot check of peak flow accuracy. The family coordinator helped prepare
each family for its doctor visit; accompanied the family to the visit; and
assisted it in presenting the asthma diary, describing the child's condition,
and acquiring an asthma plan. Allergy testing was performed to help families
develop an informed approach to controlling triggers. After the third
workshop, the family coordinator conducted a home environment assessment and
suggested strategies for reducing asthma triggers, especially in the child's
bedroom. Allergen-impermeable casings for pillows and bedding were provided
for children who tested positive for dust mites. Caretakers were again
interviewed following the 3-month intervention.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled cohort design

**Sample Size:**  
Each of 119 families with a child ages 4-19 years who had moderate to severe
asthma were recruited into one of seven cohorts of 16-18 members each.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included asthma knowledge, self-efficacy for managing asthma,
asthma self-regulatory phase, adherence to prescribed medications,
prophylactic use of a bronchodilator, asthma symptom persistence, and activity
restrictions caused by asthma. The intervention produced improvements on all
health outcome measures. Intervention families' knowledge of asthma rose to a
statistically significant 67% correct responses, and asthma knowledge among
the control group remained constant at about 40%. The intervention program
contributed to a 41% increase in the participants' self-efficacy for managing
asthma, compared with a 9% increase in the control group. At follow-up, 66% of
the intervention group had achieved asthma self-regulatory phases 3 (asthma
compliance) or 4 (asthma self-regulation). In contrast, 28% of the control
families were classified in phase 3, and one reached phase 4. Physicians'
prescription of controller medications increased significantly in the
intervention group but decreased in the control group. At follow-up, 82% of
the intervention group reported adhering to the prescribed frequency of
medication administrations, and 86% adhered to prescribed dosages, compared
with only 40% and 42% for the control group, respectively. At follow-up, 26%
of intervention families reported cough or wheeze more than twice a week, 14%
reported nighttime awakening more than twice a week, and 26% reported keeping
their child at home more than twice a month. The comparative frequencies among
the control group were 50%, 40%, and 48%, respectively. The intervention group
reported a 20% reduction in activity restrictions from baseline to follow-up,
compared with a 2% increase for the control group.

**Editor 's Notes:**  
A pre-post design trial of this phase-based asthma education program was
implemented in 2002-03 in East Harlem among Head Start families. The New York
City Agency for Children's Services has instituted a mandate requiring written
asthma plans for all children in Head Start programs, a requirement that was
phased in over the 2002-03 school year and is considered a prerequisite

### Living With Asthma

Taplin PS, Ullman S. Living with asthma. I. Genesis and development of a self-
management program for childhood asthma. J Asthma 1988;25(6):335-362.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Residential treatment facility for resident children with asthma

**Target Population:**  
Children and their families

**Program Description:**  
A pediatric asthma program based on social learning theory. The program is
designed to teach children how to manage their asthma by providing education
and opportunities to use their newly acquired skills to recognize symptoms and
triggers and to determine the appropriate course of action. The program
consists of eight sessions. The first four provide basic asthma education and
an understanding of how to medically manage asthma. The last four occurred
during the "performance phases" and focused primarily on utilizing and
refining the knowledge and skills learned earlier.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Families were assigned randomly to the intervention group and a wait-listed
control group. Once 10 families were assigned to each group, the intervention
began. The wait-listed control received the intervention approximately three
months later; therefore, participants served as their own controls during the
performance segment of the study. The data was analyzed using ANOVA.

**Sample Size:**  
399 participated over a three-year period of time. The data reported in the
study were based on 278 individuals including 123 children between the ages of
5 and 17.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Several pen and paper instruments were used to measure changes in knowledge
and attitudes about asthma on the parts of children and their parents.
Pulmonary physiology measures (a complete work-up and peak flow meter
readings); self-report measures on compliance and on the number and severity
of attacks (in the form of an asthma diary); and the financial cost of asthma
were also collected. Patients improved significantly in their ability to
prevent and manage attacks. School absenteeism and financial costs associated
with asthma were reduced as well. There were also improvements in parental and
child attitudes about asthma.

### Pediatric Asthma Program

field trial of ACINDESs*: A child centered training model for children with
chronic illnesses (asthma and epilepsy). Journal of Urban Health
2000;77(2):280-96.

*ACINDESs is the Association for Health Research and Development, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The intervention was conducted in a classroom in Buenos Aires, Argentina that
was not associated with a hospital or clinic. Families were recruited from
several health facilities (including asthma clinics) within the City of Buenos
Aires and its environs. This program reportedly represents the first Hispanic
child-centered group training program in Latin America focused on asthma self-
management.

**Target Population:**  
Spanish-speaking school-aged children aged 6-15 years who had been diagnosed
with moderate to severe asthma

**Program Description:**  
The study's objective was to assess the effectiveness of an asthma education
program founded on the basis of a child's autonomy. This approach places the
children in the center in the management of their own health; parents become
facilitators and physicians are counselors. The program was designed to help
the children change their beliefs and attitudes about their ability to care
for themselves. By learning about the alternatives from which they can choose,
children acquire tools to modify their health behaviors. The participants
attended five weekly 2-hour group meetings (parents and children in separate
sessions conducted at the same time) followed by a reinforcement meeting 2 and
6 months later. Instruction was provided by professional teachers who employed
games, drawings, stories, videos, and role play. Children and parents learned
a) the child's condition, body signals, and warning signs, b) triggers, c)
treatment alternatives, d) risks and actions-emergency home treatment, and e)
decision-making based on expected values.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This study utilized a randomized controlled design. The experimental group was
invited to participate in training and receive home interviews and follow-ups
at 6 and 12 months. The control group received home interviews at same time.
Surveys included a socio-cultural questionnaire, and school absenteeism was
also recorded. Number of crises, routine and emergency department visits, and
hospitalizations registered from medical records 6 months prior and up to 1
year after the program were recorded.

**Sample Size:**  
The study consisted of 188 children; 127 were randomly placed in the
experimental group and 61 in the control group. A total of 64 children in the
experimental group and 43 in the control group completed the study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included general knowledge of asthma, beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors, clinical outcomes, and school absenteeism. Parents in the
experimental group showed increased asthma knowledge whereas knowledge for
parents serving as controls waned. Fear of the child's death decreased from
39% to 4% in the experimental group whereas parents in the control group
showed no decrease in levels of fear. Children's confidence in self-care
skills showed marked improvement after the intervention. The experimental
group had fewer asthma crises: an average 2.02 compared with 1.09 in the
control group in a 12-month period, a statistically significant difference.
Medical-care visits decreased from an average 3.29 to 1.65. School absenteeism
fell in the experimental group from 10 to 5.91 during March through July (fall
and winter in Argentina). School attendance was above that of a sample of 345
Buenos Aires children without chronic illness for the same time period.
