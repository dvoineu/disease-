**Healthy and happy childhoods start now. Learn how you can help!**

Young children experience the world through their relationships with parents
and other caregivers. Children and families thrive when they have access to
safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. These relationships
and environments are the key to creating positive childhood experiences.

What are adverse childhood experiences?

Early negative events impact the health and well-being of children and the
adults they become. These negative events are known as **adverse childhood
experiences** **,** or ACEs. ACEs are potentially traumatic events that occur
in childhood. For example:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * experiencing violence or abuse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * witnessing violence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * having a family member attempt or die by suicide

ACEs also include aspects of the environment like growing up in a household
with:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * substance misuse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * mental health problems
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * instability due to parental separation or household members being in jail or prison

Some adversity and stress are normal and can even be helpful so that children
learn how to react to future challenges. However, if children are repeatedly
exposed to adversities like abuse and neglect and unstable relationships or
environments, they may experience **toxic stress**.

**Toxic stress** , or prolonged and repeated stress, can change a child's
brain development and increase the risk for problems like post-traumatic
stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties. Children
growing up with toxic stress may have difficulty forming healthy and stable
relationships. They may also have unstable work histories as adults and
struggle with finances and depression throughout life. Read more about the
impacts of ACEs on adult health and wellbeing.

What are child abuse and neglect?

Child abuse and neglect are **ACEs** and include all types of abuse and
neglect against a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another
person in a custodial role (such as a religious leader, a coach, a teacher)
that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. There
are four common types of child abuse and neglect:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Physical abuse**  
Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a
child.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Sexual abuse  
**Examples include behaviors such as fondling, penetration, and exposing a
child to other sexual activities. Please see **CDC 's Preventing Child Sexual
Abuse webpage** for more information.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Emotional abuse**  
Examples include name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and
threatening.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Neglect**  
Examples include failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs
such as housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.

Facts about child abuse and neglect

 **Child abuse and neglect are common.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * At least 1 in 7 children have experienced child abuse and/or neglect in the past year, and this is likely an underestimate.

**Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Rates of child abuse and neglect are 5 times higher for children in families with low socio-economic status.

**Child abuse and neglect and other ACEs have a tremendous impact on lifelong
health and wellbeing.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Exposure to violence in childhood increases the risks of future violence victimization and perpetration, substance misuse, chronic health conditions, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities.

The good news is **prevention is possible**. Everyone can help prevent child
abuse and neglect and promote positive childhood experiences by supporting
children and families where you live and work.

**Parents and caregivers:  
**Parenting is hard work! There are many things you can do to create positive
childhood experiences.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Establish a routine. Children feel secure and thrive when the environment is structured for them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Praise your child when she does something right. The more you praise a behavior, the more likely it is your child will behave the same way again.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Pay attention to your child when he is trying to communicate with you. Giving him your full attention will make him feel like you care about what he has to say.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Set aside time each day to talk and play with your child. Creating a special time lets your child know she is important and strengthens the bond between the two of you.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Check out** **CDC 's Essentials for Parenting Toddlers and Preschoolers** **! This website can help you handle common parenting challenges and improve skills so you can enjoy helping your child grow.**

We know that every child and every parent is unique. You may face many
different situations and challenges every day. **It 's ok to ask for help.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Reach out to babysitters, family members, or close friends.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Discuss your concerns with your child's doctor.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Find out if your community offers support groups or programs parents and caregivers.

**Friends, family, and neighbors:  
**As a friend or neighbor, you can develop nurturing, supportive relationships
with the children in your life. Offer to babysit, make a meal, or drive a
parent or child where they need to go.

**Coworkers:  
**As a coworker, you can listen and support your colleagues by encouraging
them to take breaks or seek additional help if needed. You can also offer to
help with their workload.

**Everyone:  
**We can all recognize challenges that families face and offer support and
encouragement to reduce stress. Everyone can promote social norms that
discourage violence and help ensure the safety of all members of a community.

We can also support community programs and policies that provide safe and
healthy conditions for all children and families.

**Working together, we can help create neighborhoods, communities, and a world
in which every child can thrive.**
