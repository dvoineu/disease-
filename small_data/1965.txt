There are many individuals and organizations working in effective and engaging
ways to end TB in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) U.S. TB Elimination Champions Project provides an opportunity
to recognize accomplishments and learn best practices from people who are
making a significant contribution to preventing and controlling TB in the
United States.

In keeping with the 2020 U.S. World TB Day theme "It's Time!",  CDC is looking
for organizations and individuals working across a wide spectrum of TB
activities to end TB in their communities. Our aim is to elevate awareness of
these activities with the use of high visual interest photos. We have listed
below theme categories and slogans that 2020 Champions photos may reflect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * It's time to test and treat latent TB infection.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * It's time to speak up.
