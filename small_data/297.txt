### Text Version

Doctors, nurses, or other health professionals should screen* every adult
patient, including pregnant women, and counsel those who drink too much.
Providers can help women avoid drinking too much, including avoiding alcohol
during pregnancy, in 5 steps.

                      1. Assess a woman's drinking. 
                        * Use a validated screener (e.g., AUDIT {US}*).
                        * Take 6-15 minutes to explain results and provide counseling to women who are drinking too much.
                        * Advise her not to drink at all if she is pregnant or might be pregnant.
                        * Come up with a plan together.
                      2. Recommend birth control if a woman is having sex (if appropriate), not planning to get pregnant, and is drinking alcohol. 
                        * Review risk for pregnancy and importance of birth control use.
                        * Discuss full range of methods available.
                        * Encourage her to always use condoms to reduce risk of sexually transmitted diseases.
                      3. Advise a woman to stop drinking if she is trying to get pregnant or not using birth control with sex. 
                        * Discuss the reasons to stop alcohol use before the woman realizes she is pregnant.
                      4. Refer for additional services if a woman cannot stop drinking on her own. 
                        * Provide information on local programs or go to SAMHSA treatment locator. www.findtreatment.samhsa.govexternal icon
                        * Consider referral to treatment or recommend Alcoholics Anonymous. www.aa.orgexternal icon
                      5. Follow up yearly or more often, as needed. 
                        * Set a time for return appointment.
                        * Continue support at follow-up.
