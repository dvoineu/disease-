                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Vitamin E acetate usually does not cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. However, previous research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning.

**What are the health risks of marijuana (THC)?**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Use of THC, which comes from marijuana, has been associated with a wide range of health effects, particularly with prolonged heavy use. The best way to avoid potentially harmful effects is not to use THC, including through e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Persons engaging in ongoing marijuana use that leads to significant impairment or distress should seek evidence-based treatment by a healthcare professional.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * These effects range from short-term problems with attention, memory, learning, to longer-term problems such as psychosis, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, and substance use disorder. It is not known whether these are causal relationships or simply associations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The best way to avoid potentially harmful effects is to not use marijuana.

**How does marijuana use in e-cigarette, or vaping, products affect youths?**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Marijuana use, including through use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products can impact your health. Regardless of the substance used, e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Marijuana use can harm the developing adolescent brain and impact attention, learning, and memory. Starting to use marijuana at a younger age leads to higher risks of more problematic use later in life.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Youth marijuana use has also been associated with antisocial and oppositional behaviors, nicotine use, poor school performance, use of other illicit substances and the development of substance use disorders, and impairments in social relationships.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * It is important for parents to communicate with their children about the risks of nicotine, THC, or other substance use.

**What should I do if I am currently using marijuana/THC in an e-cigarette, or
vaping, product for medical use?**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * CDC and FDA recommend that people not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * If you have recently used a THC-containing product in an e-cigarette, or vaping, product and you have symptoms like those reported in this outbreak, see a healthcare provider.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * We do not know if there are different health risks of using different forms of marijuana, such as smoking, vaping, and edibles, or whether transitioning from one form to another might reduce harm. Talk with your healthcare provider about other available treatment options for the conditions.

**How are states regulating THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products?**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Some states have legalized the use of THC-containing vaping products for nonmedical (recreational) or medical purposes. State regulations vary with regard to product pre-approval processes, ingredient requirements and/or limitations, packaging and labeling, and testing requirements and methods. States typically conduct various levels of testing of products, including testing for potency, contaminants, metals, pesticides, and pathogens.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Both THC-containing and nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products purchased legally within states might also contain harmful substances. It is difficult to know what is in these products. Full ingredient lists are typically not available.

Questions about Flu Season and the Use of E-cigarette, or Vaping, Products

 **Should I get vaccinated for the flu if using e-cigarettes, or vaping,
products?**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine, including people who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths.

Flu is especially dangerous for pregnant women, people of any age with certain
long-term health conditions, people 65 and older, and young children. Check
out Key Facts About Seasonal Flu Vaccine for more information.
