                    * This year saw the largest number of illnesses linked to contact with backyard poultry ever recorded by CDC. Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with _Salmonella_ infections. Live poultry such as chickens and ducks can be carrying _Salmonella_ bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness. 
                      * As raising backyard flocks becomes more popular, more people are having contact with chickens and ducks - and may not know about the risk of _Salmonella_ infection.
                    * These outbreaks are a reminder to follow steps to keep your family healthy while enjoying your backyard flock. 
                      * Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where the birds live and roam.
                      * Adults should supervise handwashing for children.
                      * Do not let live poultry inside the house.
                      * Do not let children younger than 5 years handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry without adult supervision.
                    * In 2017, CDC and multiple states investigated 10 separate multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections in people who had contact with live poultry in backyard flocks. 
                      * The outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ infected a reported 1120 people in 48 states and the District of Columbia

                    * Outbreaks linked to contact with live poultry have increased in recent years as more people keep backyard flocks. In 2016, a record number of illnesses were linked to contact with backyard poultry.

Advice to Backyard Flock Owners

**Follow these steps for protecting yourself and others while enjoying your
backyard flock:**

                    * Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Also wash your hands after handling clothes and shoes that have touched live poultry. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children. 
                      * If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer until you are able to wash your hands with soap and water.
                    * Do not let live poultry inside the house, in bathrooms, or especially in areas where food or drink is prepared, served, or stored, such as kitchens or outdoor patios. 
                      * Do not eat or drink in the area where the birds live or roam.
                      * For information about how to keep birds safe outside in very hot or very cold weather, ask the hatchery or feed store where the bird was purchased. Another resource is your county extension officeExternal.
                    * Set aside a pair of shoes to wear while taking care of poultry and keep those shoes outside of the house.
                    * Children younger than 5 years, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems should not handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry. People in these groups are more likely to have a severe illness from _Salmonella_ infection.
                    * Do not snuggle or kiss the birds, touch your mouth, or eat or drink around live poultry.
                    * Stay outdoors when cleaning any equipment or materials used to raise or care for live poultry, such as cages, feed, or water containers.
                    * If you collect eggs from your hens, follow safe handling tips: 
                      * Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling eggs, chickens, or anything in their environment.
                      * Collect eggs often. Eggs that spend a significant amount of time in the nest can become dirty or break. Cracked eggs should be thrown away.
                      * Refrigerate eggs after collection.
                      * Eggs with dirt and debris can be cleaned with fine sandpaper, a brush or cloth. Don't wash eggs, because colder water can pull bacteria into the egg.
                      * Cook eggs thoroughly. Raw and undercooked eggs may contain _Salmonella_ bacteria that can make you sick.
                    * Read CDC's recommendations for taking care of your backyard flock, which apply to all live poultry, regardless of the age of the birds or where they were purchased.

Advice to Mail-Order Hatcheries

Mail-order hatcheries should provide health-related information to owners and
potential purchasers before they buy any birds (see example below). This
should include information about preventing _Salmonella_ infections from
contact with live poultry.

                    * A flier Cdc-pdf[PDF - 1 page] describing the risk of human _Salmonella_ infections from contact with live poultry and prevention recommendations is available.

Mail-order hatcheries should put interventions in place to help prevent
contamination and infection of poultry with _Salmonella_ :

                    * Best Management Practices Handbook: A Guide to the Mitigation of _Salmonella_ Contamination at Poultry Hatcheries Cdc-pdf[PDF - 25 pages]External

Mail-order hatcheries should participate in the USDA-NPIP U.S. _Salmonella_
Monitored Program Cdc-pdf[PDF - 17 pages]External, in which voluntary
participation by mail-order hatcheries will certify their flocks are monitored
for _Salmonella_ bacteria that may cause illness in humans. The intent of this
program is to reduce the incidence of _Salmonella_ in day-old poultry in the
hatchery and give the poultry industry a better opportunity to reduce the
incidence of _Salmonella_ in their products.

Advice to Feed Stores that Sell or Display Live Poultry

**Agricultural feed stores should take steps to prevent human _Salmonella_
infections from contact with live poultry:**

                    * Source the birds they sell from suppliers that have adopted USDA's best management practices to mitigate _Salmonella_ contamination Cdc-pdf[PDF - 25 pages]External.
                    * Source the birds they sell from hatcheries which voluntarily participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Poultry Improvement Plan (USDA-NPIP) U.S. _Salmonella_ Monitored Program Cdc-pdf[PDF - 17 pages]External.
                    * Provide health information to owners and potential purchasers of these birds before purchase (see sample flier below). This should include information about the risk of acquiring a _Salmonella_ infection from contact with live poultry. 
                      * A flier Cdc-pdf[PDF - 1 page] describing the risk of human _Salmonella_ infections from contact with live poultry and prevention recommendations is available.
                    * Place health information in clear view where birds are displayed.
                    * Provide hand washing stations or hand sanitizer next to poultry display areas and tell customers to wash hands right after leaving these areas.
                    * Display poultry out of reach of customers, especially chil­dren, so customers can not easily touch birds.
                    * Clean the areas where birds are displayed between shipments of new birds.
                    * More information on displaying animals in public settings can be found in the 2013 Compendium of Measures to Prevent Diseases Associated with Animals in Public SettingsExternal.
