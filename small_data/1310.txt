##### Where we have been:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Less than 1 in 3 children with ADHD in this age group got both behavioral therapy and medication.

##### Where we need to go:

(Treatment guidance, 2011)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Provide both behavioral therapy and medication.

##### What can you do?
