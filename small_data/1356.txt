What Are E-cigarettes?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are electronic devices that heat a liquid and produce an aerosol, or mix of small particles in the air.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes. Most have a battery, a heating element, and a place to hold a liquid.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Some e-cigarettes look like regular cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. Some look like USB flash drives, pens, and other everyday items. Larger devices such as tank systems, or "mods," do not look like other tobacco products.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are known by many different names. They are sometimes called "e-cigs," "e-hookahs," "mods," "vape pens," "vapes," "tank systems," and "electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Using an e-cigarette is sometimes called "vaping" or "JUULing."

How Do E-cigarettes Work?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals that help to make the aerosol.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The liquid used in e-cigarettes often contains nicotine and flavorings. This liquid is sometimes called "e-juice," "e-liquid," "vape juice," or "vape liquid."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Users inhale e-cigarette aerosol into their lungs. Bystanders can also breathe in this aerosol when the user exhales it into the air.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarette devices can be used to deliver marijuana and other drugs.

What Is JUUL?

![classroom with diverse
students](/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/images/students-in-
classroom.jpg)

News outlets and social media sites report widespread use of JUUL by students
in schools, including classrooms and bathrooms.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * JUUL is a brand of e-cigarette that is shaped like a USB flash drive. Like other e-cigarettes, JUUL is a battery-powered device that heats a nicotine-containing liquid to produce an aerosol that is inhaled.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * All JUUL e-cigarettes have a high level of nicotine. According to the manufacturer, a single JUUL pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * JUUL is one of a few e-cigarettes that use nicotine salts, which allow particularly high levels of nicotine to be inhaled more easily and with less irritation than the free-base nicotine that has traditionally been used in tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * News outlets and social media sites report widespread use of JUUL by students in schools, including classrooms and bathrooms.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Approximately two-thirds of JUUL users aged 15 - 24 do not know that JUUL always contains nicotine.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Although JUUL is currently the top-selling e-cigarette brand in the United States, other companies sell e-cigarettes that look like USB flash drives. Examples include the MarkTen Elite, a nicotine delivery device, and the PAX Era, a marijuana delivery device that looks like JUUL.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Additional information about USB-shaped e-cigarettes and actions that parents, educators, and health care providers can take to protect kids is available at CDC's Infographicpdf icon [PDF - 1.2MB]

Why Is Nicotine Unsafe for Kids, Teens, and Young Adults?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine--the addictive drug in regular cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A recent CDC study found that 99% of the e-cigarettes sold in assessed venues in the United States contained nicotine.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Some e-cigarette labels do not disclose that they contain nicotine, and some e-cigarettes marketed as containing 0% nicotine have been found to contain nicotine.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Nicotine can harm the developing adolescent brain.1 The brain keeps developing until about age 25.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Using nicotine in adolescence can harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control.1
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Each time a new memory is created or a new skill is learned, stronger connections - or synapses - are built between brain cells. Young people's brains build synapses faster than adult brains. Nicotine changes the way these synapses are formed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Using nicotine in adolescence may also increase risk for future addiction to other drugs.1

What Are the Other Risks of E-cigarettes for Kids, Teens, and Young Adults?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Scientists are still learning about the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Some of the ingredients in e-cigarette aerosol could also be harmful to the lungs in the long-term. For example, some e-cigarette flavorings may be safe to eat but not to inhale because the gut can process more substances than the lungs.1
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Defective e-cigarette batteries have caused some fires and explosions, a few of which have resulted in serious injuries.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Children and adults have been poisoned by swallowing, breathing, or absorbing e-cigarette liquid through their skin or eyes. Nationally, approximately 50% of calls to poison control centers for e-cigarettes are for kids 5 years of age or younger.

Flavors and Marketing Make E-cigarettes Appealing to Youth

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Many e-cigarettes come in fruit, candy, and other kid-friendly flavors, such as mango, fruit and creme.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A majority of youth e-cigarette users report using flavored varieties, most youth e-cigarette users first start using e-cigarettes with a flavored variety, and flavors are the primary reason youth report using e-cigarettes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are also advertised using the same themes and tactics that have been shown to increase youth initiation of other tobacco products, including cigarettes. In 2016, about 8 in 10 middle school and high school students--more than 20 million youth--said they had seen e-cigarette advertising.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Widespread advertising for these products, including via media for which advertising for conventional tobacco products is prohibited (e.g., TV), and the lower costs of some of these products relative to conventional cigarettes has contributed to the increase in e-cigarette use among youth.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Many youth also report using e-cigarettes because they are curious about these new products, and because they believe these products to be less harmful than conventional cigarettes.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Specifically, a 2018 National Academy of Medicine report found that there was some evidence that e-cigarette use increases the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking in the future.4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes also can be used to deliver other drugs, including marijuana; in 2016, approximately one-third of U.S. middle and high school students who have ever used an e-cigarette reported using marijuana in the device.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * But e-cigarette use among young people is unsafe, even if they do not progress to future cigarette smoking.

Are E-cigarettes Regulated at the Federal Level?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Yes. In August 2016, the regulatory authority of the FDA was extended to cover e-cigarettes through the agency's "deeming rule."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Through authority granted by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA), FDA has authority to develop regulations that address the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of e-cigarettes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * However, the FSPTCA does not prevent states and communities from adopting many strategies related to e-cigarettes. There are also many strategies that FDA does not have authority to implement and that states can do, such as including e-cigarettes in smoke-free policies, pricing strategies, and increasing the age of sale for tobacco products to 21.

Are There Any National Public Education Prevention Campaigns Focused on Youth
and E-cigarettes?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Yes. In 2018, the FDA expanded its successful youth tobacco prevention campaignexternal icon, "The Real Cost," to reach the more than 10 million youth aged 12-17 who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. The campaign educates youth about the potential risks of using e-cigarettes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The "Real Cost" reaches teens where they spend most of their time: in school and online. The campaign is also placing e-cigarette prevention materials in high schools across the nation, both in school bathrooms and on educational digital platforms accessed by students during the school day.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The Truth Initiative® launched the "Safer ≠ Safe" campaign in 2018, focusing on correcting youth misperceptions and providing accurate information about e-cigarettes and youth. The campaign is being promoted on digital and social media, including the Safer ≠ Safe websiteexternal icon, which features videos, articles and interactive activities for youth.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Heated tobacco products (HTPs) like IQOS and Eclipse, sometimes marketed as "heat-not-burn" technology, represent a diverse class of products that heat the tobacco leaf to produce an inhaled aerosol. They are different from e-cigarettes, which heat a liquid that can contain nicotine derived from tobacco.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * HTPs are available in at least 40 countries and have several have been authorized for sale in the United States by the FDA. In 2018, few U.S. adults (2.4% of all surveyed, including 6.7% of current smokers surveyed) had ever used HTPs. Youth use of HTPs is unknown, but monitoring is underway.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Scientists are still learning about the short-term and long-term health effects of HTPs, but the available science shows they contain harmful and potentially harmful ingredients. Youth use of any tobacco products, including heated products, is unsafe.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * It is important that we continue to modernize proven tobacco prevention and control strategies to include newer products entering the market such as HTPs.
