The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is deeply concerned for
the health and safety of people involved in CDC-funded activities, and about
the effects on the public's health from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Due to the potential scale of the declared public health emergency, we want to
assure our grant and cooperative agreement recipient community that CDC will
be doing our part to help you continue your work. CDC will support accelerated
planning and operational readiness for COVID-19 preparedness and response, as
well as develop tools and strategies, provide technical assistance and program
support, and ensure ongoing communication and coordination among federal,
state, local, tribal, and territorial public health agencies and partners
throughout the response. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and we will
continue to provide updated guidance and information as it becomes available.
