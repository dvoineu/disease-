# About ERPO

Minus

Related Pages

The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) Extramural
Research Program Office (ERPO) is the focal point for the development, peer
review, and post-award management of extramural research awards for NCIPC and
the National Center for Environmental Health/Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry; and ensures their extramural research portfolios are
designed for maximum public health impact.

Why We Do Extramural Research

Everyone regardless of age, race, or economic status can be affected by
injuries and violence. Injuries and violence are among the top 10 leading
causes of death in the United States. While many may view injuries as
inevitable or unavoidable, they are in fact predictable and preventable.

At CDC's Injury Center, we translate science into effective programs and
policies that prevent unintentional and violence-related injuries and that
minimize the consequences of injuries when they occur. Research is fundamental
to our success because thorough, accurate data are essential in making sound,
smart investments. Research provides the knowledge that we need to understand
what is possible, what is not, and the best way to proceed in our intervention
efforts (CDC Research Priorities 2018pdf icon).

Purpose

The role of the ERPO includes serving as the liaison between research award
recipients and the Office of Grant Service in coordination with Division
programs. ** ** ERPO plans, develops, coordinates, and evaluates extramural
research activities of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
and the National Center for Environmental Health/Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry. CDC is entrusted by the public to use research dollars
where they will have the maximum impact on public health. Good management of
research involves three key steps.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. Identification of research priorities.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Translation of these priorities into a balanced portfolio of intramural and extramural research.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. Evaluation of research programs and outcomes. In addition, a fourth step is implied, i.e. the incorporation of lessons learned from evaluation into future prioritization and research.
