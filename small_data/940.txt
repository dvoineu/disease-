Most state laboratories are approved to test for Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using CDC's rRT-PCR assay.

FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on June 5, 2013, to authorize
use of CDC's 2012 real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay to test for MERS-
CoV in clinical respiratory, serum, and stool specimens. CDC has distributed
this assay to qualified laboratories in the United States and around the
world. See 2013 Coronavirus Emergency Use Authorization (Potential
Emergency)external icon [FDA, June 6, 2013]. The Emergency Use Authorization
was expanded in June 2014 to allow use for testing asymptomatic contacts.
