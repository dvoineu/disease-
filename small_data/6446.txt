## Overview

The _NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards_ (NPG) informs workers, employers,
and occupational health professionals about workplace chemicals and their
hazards. The NPG gives general industrial hygiene information for hundreds of
chemicals/classes. The NPG clearly presents key data for chemicals or
substance groupings (such as cyanides, fluorides, manganese compounds) that
are found in workplaces. The guide offers key facts, but does not give all
relevant data. The NPG helps users recognize and control workplace chemical
hazards.

NIOSH offers four versions of the NPG: print, online, PDF, and mobile web app.

Health Topic Page.
