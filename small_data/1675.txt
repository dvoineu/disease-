                Description: STD disparities are likely the result of a complex interaction between genetic variations, health behaviors, sexual networks, and other environmental factors. Also, some populations may be more likely than others to be tested for STDs, and/or to have their cases of STDs reported.

The results of that conversation was the STD/STI Framing Conversation Report.Cdc-pdfAlthough there are some signs of progress, large disparities by age and race still exist. The STD/STI Framing Report provides the workgroup's suggestions and actionable items for consideration for CDC to combat this persistent high burden of STDs. This report is useful for governmental agencies, non-governmental agencies, and non-traditional partners working with ethnic and minority communities in the health and medical fields.
