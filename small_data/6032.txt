Arthritis occurs in 27% of adults in Montana, among whom 50% have activity
limitations, 16% have social participation restrictions, and 23% have severe
joint pain attributable to arthritis ( _1_ ). Physical activity is beneficial
in managing arthritis symptoms and in preventing other chronic diseases ( _2_
). Walk With Ease is a 6-week evidence-based physical activity program
recommended by CDC to increase physical activity and help improve arthritis
symptoms ( _3_ ). In 2015, Walk With Ease was added to an ongoing workplace
wellness program for Montana state employees; the results for five outcomes
(minutes spent walking, engaging in other physical activity [including
swimming, bicycling, other aerobic equipment use, and other aerobic exercise],
stretching, pain, and fatigue) were analyzed by the Montana Department of
Public Health and Human Services and CDC. Outcomes at baseline (pretest), 6
weeks after the program (posttest), and 6 months later (follow-up) were
analyzed by self-reported arthritis status at the time the participant
enrolled in the program. Significant increases (p<0.05) in the mean number of
minutes spent per week walking and engaging in other physical activity were
observed among participants with and without arthritis at the 6-week posttest.
Time spent stretching did not change significantly at posttest for either
group. Mean pain levels among participants without arthritis increased
significantly both at the 6-week posttest and 6-month follow-up; however, pain
and fatigue decreased significantly at posttest and follow-up for participants
with or without arthritis who began the program with moderate or severe pain
and fatigue levels. The data from these analyses suggest that, as a component
of a workplace wellness program, self-directed Walk With Ease might be
effective in increasing physical activity not only among adults with
arthritis, but also among persons without arthritis.

Walk With Ease is a graduated walking program that can be delivered in an
instructor-led group setting or through a self-directed workbook. Self-
directed Walk With Ease participants communicate with a trainer by e-mail and
walk on their own, reporting activity weekly. The Montana Health Care and
Benefits Division has included self-directed Walk With Ease since 2015 in the
established state employee wellness program, offering a health insurance
premium discount as a financial incentive to participate in and complete the
program.

Identical assessment surveys were conducted at the beginning of the program
(at which time participants self-reported whether they had arthritis),
immediately after the 6-week program, and at a 6-month follow-up. The surveys
included questions on time spent engaged in six physical activities as well as
levels of pain and fatigue, ranked on a scale of 0-10\. The six physical
activity questions asked how much time during the past week participants
performed 1) stretching or strengthening exercises, 2) walking for exercise,
3) swimming or aquatic exercise, 4) bicycling (including using a stationary
bike), 5) exercise using aerobic equipment other than a stationary bike, and
6) other aerobic exercise. Responses for the amount of time that participants
engaged in physical activity, including walking and stretching, per week were
coded as 0 (none), 1 (<30 minutes), 2 (30-60 minutes), 3 (61-180 minutes), or
4 (>180 minutes); these were converted to minutes (0, 15, 45, 120, and 240),
respectively, for the analysis, using the median of each range and four hours
for the highest category. Time spent engaged in other physical activity was
obtained from the total number of minutes spent swimming, bicycling, using
other aerobic equipment, and engaging in other aerobic exercise.

To ascertain pain and fatigue, participants were asked how much pain or
fatigue they experienced during the past week, on a scale from 0 (no pain or
fatigue) to 10 (severe pain or fatigue), and were grouped into mild (1-3),
moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10) categories for analysis. Data were analyzed
for the period 2015-2017\. Pretest, 6-week posttest, and 6-month follow-up
data were compared using paired t-tests, with statistical significance defined
as p<0.05.

The number of participants increased from 105 in 2015 to 1,343 in 2016, and to
1,622 in 2017. The majority of the 3,070 total participants during 2015-2017
were aged >45 years (75%), white (94%), women (72%), college graduates (63%),
and with no disability (90%) or arthritis (76%) (Table 1). Among those
participating in the program, 2,598 (85%) completed it by submitting weekly
time spent engaged in physical activity during at least 4 of 6 weeks. Overall,
1,936 (63%) and 934 (30%) participants completed the 6-week posttest or
6-month follow-up survey, respectively. Among 743 (24%) persons with arthritis
who started the program, 496 (67%) completed the 6-week posttest, and 279
(38%) provided 6-month follow-up data. Of the 2,327 (76%) persons without
arthritis who started the program, the 6-week posttest and 6-month follow up
was completed by 1,440 (62%) and 655 (28%) participants, respectively. (Table
1).

Among participants with and without arthritis, the mean number of minutes per
week spent walking and engaged in other physical activity significantly
increased at posttest. Overall, 73% of persons who walked <30 minutes per week
at pretest increased to >60 minutes at posttest. Similarly, the majority of
those starting at <30 minutes increased to >30 minutes at the 6-month follow-
up (Figure). From a baseline of no walking, 97% were walking at 6 weeks, with
65% walking >60 minutes per week; 87% continued walking at the 6-month follow-
up, with 35% walking >60 minutes per week. Among all participants who began
the program walking 1-3 hours and >3 hours per week, 89% and 72%,
respectively, maintained or increased their time spent walking at posttest.
Mean number of minutes spent stretching did not change significantly at
posttest. Mean walking and other physical activity did not change
significantly at 6-month follow-up, except for a significant increase in
walking when considering all participants. Stretching increased significantly
at 6 months only for those with no arthritis (Table 2).

Among participants without arthritis, mean reported pain level increased
significantly at 6 weeks and 6 months. Mean level of fatigue decreased
significantly for both those with arthritis and no arthritis at 6 weeks, but
increased significantly for those without arthritis at 6 months.

Among participants who started with moderate or severe pain and fatigue
levels, mean pain and fatigue decreased significantly at posttest and 6-month
follow-up among participants with and without arthritis (Table 2), whereas
among participants starting the program with low levels of pain and fatigue,
small but significant increases in mean pain and fatigue at the 6-week
posttest and 6-month follow-up occurred for participants with and without
arthritis (Table 2).

##  Discussion

Participants with and without self-reported arthritis in the self-directed
Walk With Ease program in Montana experienced significant increases at the
6-week posttest in the mean number of minutes per week spent walking.
Increases in the number of minutes spent walking each week were consistent
with findings from other evaluations of Walk With Ease, which showed improved
performance measures, self-reported outcomes, and well-being among persons
with self-reported arthritis ( _3_ , _4_ ). The majority of participants who
reported little (<30 minutes a week) or no walking at the start were walking
>60 minutes at the 6-week posttest and >30 minutes at the 6-month follow-up.
Most walkers who started at other levels (>30 minutes a week) also maintained
or increased their walking levels. The advances in walking at 6 weeks,
however, were diminished at 6 months, suggesting that additional efforts might
be needed to sustain program gains.

A notable finding of the analysis of the Walk With Ease program was the
increase in time spent walking among persons who were not walking at all at
the start of the intervention. The Walk With Ease program has the potential to
offer a substantial change for adults with a sedentary lifestyle, who could
benefit from public health interventions that encourage and promote a
physically active lifestyle.

Lack of significant improvements in pain overall differed from previous
findings, which showed that the walking programs reduced pain ( _4_ - _6_ ).
The significantly increased pain levels among those with no arthritis were
partially the result of regression toward the mean, with 48% of the
participants starting with mild pain levels and 34% starting with zero pain.
Short-term variability in pain scores has been documented, with more than 50%
of veterans with chronic pain showing a range of more than two points on the
0-10 numeric rating scale in a given month ( _7_ ). The pattern of worsening
pain for those with low starting pain and improvements for those with moderate
to severe pain mirrors that found in other research, which documented
increased pain among persons starting with low pain and improvement in pain
for those starting with moderate to severe pain ( _8_ , _9_ ). An improved
statistical measure to examine the pain scale when applied to healthier
populations with many participants starting with no pain might be needed (
_10_ ).

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First,
Walk With Ease outcomes are based on self-reporting of time engaged in
physical activity and pain and fatigue symptoms, which are subject to recall
and social desirability biases. Second, pain levels might include a short-term
increase of symptoms from new exercise, with later improvement; information on
location of pain in the surveys might have improved this. Third, there was no
control group to examine whether changes in pain and fatigue resulted from
regression to the mean or from the intervention. Fourth, the 6-month follow-up
had a low overall completion rate (30%), which could introduce reporting bias
if outcomes influenced reporting and if persons who maintain the benefits
long-term are more likely to respond. Finally, arthritis was self-reported and
not confirmed by medical record review or clinical evaluation, which could
have resulted in misclassification of arthritis status.

Self-directed Walk With Ease increased physical activity among adults with and
without self-reported arthritis, particularly among persons with low levels of
activity at baseline, and decreased pain and fatigue among those reporting
moderate or severe pain and fatigue at baseline. Walk With Ease can succeed as
a workplace wellness program for employees with and without arthritis, moving
persons from no activity to some activity and promoting the general health
benefits from improved physical activity. Public health professionals might
consider Walk With Ease and similar fitness programs in collaboration with
employers to improve worker health.
