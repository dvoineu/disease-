###  **Summary**

**What is already known about this topic?**

Approximately one in four U.S. adults has arthritis. Severe joint pain and
physical inactivity are common among adults with arthritis and are linked to
poor mental and physical health outcomes.

**What is added by this report?**

In 2017, marked state-specific variations in prevalences of arthritis, severe
joint pain, and physical inactivity were observed. Physical inactivity was
more prevalent among persons with severe joint pain than among those with less
pain.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

State-specific data support efforts to promote participation in arthritis-
appropriate, evidence-based self-management education and physical activity
programs, which can reduce pain, increase physical activity and function, and
improve mood and quality of life.

An estimated 54.4 million (approximately one in four) U.S. adults have doctor-
diagnosed arthritis (arthritis) ( _1_ ). Severe joint pain and physical
inactivity are common among adults with arthritis and are linked to adverse
mental and physical health effects and limitations ( _2_ , _3_ ). CDC analyzed
2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to estimate
current state-specific prevalence of arthritis and, among adults with
arthritis, the prevalences of severe joint pain and physical inactivity. In
2017, the median age-standardized state prevalence of arthritis among adults
aged ≥18 years was 22.8% (range = 15.7% [District of Columbia] to 34.6% [West
Virginia]) and was generally highest in Appalachia and Lower Mississippi
Valley regions.* Among adults with arthritis, age-standardized, state-specific
prevalences of both severe joint pain (median = 30.3%; range = 20.8%
[Colorado] to 45.2% [Mississippi]) and physical inactivity (median = 33.7%;
range = 23.2% [Colorado] to 44.4% [Kentucky]) were highest in southeastern
states. Physical inactivity prevalence among those with severe joint pain
(47.0%) was higher than that among those with moderate (31.8%) or no/mild
joint pain (22.6%). Self-management strategies such as maintaining a healthy
weight or being physically active can reduce arthritis pain and prevent or
delay arthritis-related disability. Evidence-based physical activity and self-
management education programs are available that can improve quality of life
among adults with arthritis.

BRFSS is an ongoing state-based, landline and cellular telephone survey of
noninstitutionalized adults in the United States aged ≥18 years that is
conducted by state and territorial health departments in 50 U.S. states, the
District of Columbia (DC), and U.S. territories.† The combined (telephone and
cellular) median response rate in 2017 among states was 45.9% (range =
30.6%-64.1%); 435,331 adults reported information about arthritis status and
age, and among them, 144,099 reported having arthritis.§ Having arthritis was
defined as a response of "yes" to the question "Have you ever been told by a
doctor or other health care professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia?" No/mild, moderate, and severe joint
pain were defined by responses of 0-3, 4-6, and 7-10, respectively, to the
question "Please think about the past 30 days, keeping in mind all of your
joint pain or aching and whether or not you have taken medication. On a scale
of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain or aching and 10 is pain or aching as bad as it
can be, during the past 30 days, how bad was your joint pain on average?"
Physical inactivity was defined as a response of "no" to the question "During
the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any
physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf,
gardening, or walking for exercise?"

All analyses, which accounted for BRFSS's complex sampling design, were
conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI
International). Sampling weights, using iterative proportional fitting
(raking), were applied to make estimates representative of each state.¶ Age-
standardized,** state-specific prevalences of arthritis among adults aged ≥18
years, and of severe joint pain and physical inactivity among adults with
arthritis, were calculated by selected characteristics. Differences across
subgroups were tested using t-tests, and orthogonal linear contrasts were
conducted for tests of trends to detect linear patterns in ordinal variables (
_4_ ); all differences and trends reported in the text are significant (α =
0.05).

In 2017, age-specific arthritis prevalence was higher with increasing age,
ranging from 8.1% among those aged 18-44 years to 50.4% among those aged ≥65
years (Table 1). Age-standardized arthritis prevalence was significantly
higher among women (25.4%) than among men (19.1%); non-Hispanic American
Indian/Alaska Natives (29.7%) than among other racial/ethnic groups (range =
12.8%-25.5%); and those unable to work/disabled (51.3%), compared with retired
(34.3%), unemployed (26.0%), or employed/self-employed (17.7%). Arthritis
prevalence was higher with increasing body mass index, ranging from 17.9%
among those with healthy weight or underweight to 30.4% among those with
obesity. Arthritis prevalence was lower among Hispanics and non-Hispanic
Asians than among other racial/ethnic groups, was inversely related to
education and federal poverty level, and was higher among those living in more
rural areas compared with urban dwellers.

Among adults with arthritis, no/mild, moderate, and severe joint pain was
reported by 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 35.7%-36.8%), 33.0% (CI =
32.4%-33.5%), and 30.8% (CI = 30.3%-31.4%) of respondents, respectively
(unadjusted prevalences). Age-specific percentages for severe joint pain
declined with increasing age, ranging from 33.0% among those aged 18-44 years
to 25.1% among those aged ≥65 years. Age-standardized severe joint pain
prevalence was ≥40% among the following groups: those unable to work/disabled
(66.9%); those with less than a high school diploma (54.1%); those living at
≤125% federal poverty level (51.6%); non-Hispanic blacks (50.9%); retired
persons (45.8%); Hispanics (42.0%); non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska
Natives (42.0%); and lesbian/gay/bisexual/queer/questioning (40.7%; reported
by 27 states). Severe joint pain prevalence was similar across urban/rural
geographic areas, ranging from 32.7%-35.7% in all areas, except for a lower
prevalence (28.6%) in large fringe metro areas (Table 1).

Among adults with arthritis, age-specific physical inactivity prevalence was
higher with increasing age (ranging from 31.0% among those aged 18-44 years to
37.0% among those aged ≥65 years). Age-standardized physical inactivity
prevalence was ≥40% among the following groups: those unable to work/disabled
(51.2%); those with less than a high school diploma (46.4%); those living at
≤125% federal poverty level (42.6%); and non-Hispanic blacks (40.4%). Physical
inactivity prevalence increased with increasing rurality and with increasing
joint pain levels (ranging from 22.6% among those with no/mild joint pain to
47.0% among those with severe joint pain).

Median age-standardized state prevalence of arthritis among adults aged ≥18
years was 22.8% (range = 15.7% [DC] to 34.6% [West Virginia]) (Table 2) and
was highest in Appalachia and Lower Mississippi Valley regions. Among 144,099
adults with arthritis, median age-standardized state prevalences of severe
joint pain and physical inactivity were 30.3% (range = 20.8% [Colorado] to
45.2% [Mississippi]) and 33.7% (range = 23.2% [Colorado] to 44.4% [Kentucky]),
respectively. Age-standardized severe joint pain (Figure) and physical
inactivity prevalences were highest in southeastern states.

## Discussion

The 2017 age-standardized prevalence of arthritis was highest in Appalachia
and the Lower Mississippi Valley; prevalences of severe joint pain and
physical inactivity among adults with arthritis were highest in southeastern
states. Estimates for all three outcomes in 2017 were similar to those in 2015
( _5_ ). Except for age, urban-rural status, and sexual orientation,
sociodemographic patterns for prevalences of severe joint pain and physical
inactivity were similar and offer potential targets for interventions designed
to reduce arthritis pain.

Joint pain is often managed with medications, which are associated with
various adverse effects. The 2016 National Pain Strategy advises that pain-
management strategies be multifaceted and individualized and include
nonpharmacologic strategies,†† and the American College of Rheumatology
recommends regular physical activity as a nonpharmacologic pain reliever for
arthritis.§§ Although persons with arthritis report that pain, or fear of
causing or worsening it, is a substantial barrier to exercising ( _6_ ),
physical activity is an inexpensive intervention that can reduce pain, prevent
or delay disability and limitations, and improve mental health, physical
functioning, and quality of life with few adverse effects ( _7_ , _8_ ).¶¶
Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults, including
those with arthritis, engage in the equivalent of at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week for substantial health
benefits.*** Adults who are unable to meet the aerobic guideline because of
their condition (e.g., those with severe joint pain) should engage in regular
physical activity according to their abilities and avoid physical inactivity.
Even small amounts of physical activity can improve physical functioning in
adults with joint conditions ( _9_ ). Most adults with arthritis pain can
safely begin walking, swimming, or cycling to increase physical activity.

Arthritis-appropriate, evidence-based, self-management programs and low-
impact, group aerobic, or multicomponent physical activity programs are
designed to safely increase physical activity in persons with
arthritis.†††,§§§ These programs are available nationwide and are especially
important for those populations that might have limited access to health care,
medications, and surgical interventions (e.g., those in rural areas, those
with lower income, and racial/ethnic minorities). Physical activity programs
including low-impact aquatic exercises (e.g., Arthritis Foundation Aquatic
Program) and strength training (e.g., Fit and Strong!) can help increase
strength and endurance. Participating in self-management education programs,
such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, although not physical
activity-focused, is also beneficial for arthritis management and results in
increased physical activity. Benefits of the Chronic Disease Self-Management
Program include increased frequency of aerobic and stretching/strengthening
exercise, improved self-efficacy for arthritis pain management, and improved
mood ( _10_ ). Adults with arthritis can also engage in routine physical
activity through group aerobic exercise classes (e.g., Walk with Ease,
EnhanceFitness, Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program, and Active Living Every
Day).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First,
BRFSS data are self-reported and susceptible to recall, social desirability,
and related biases. Second, low response rates for individual states might
bias findings. Finally, institutional populations are excluded from sampling,
meaning prevalences of studied outcomes are likely underestimated. Strengths
include a measurement of joint pain and large sample size that allows analysis
of detailed characteristics and subgroups.

Effective, inexpensive physical activity and self-management education
programs are available nationwide and can help adults with arthritis be safely
and confidently physically active. This report provides the most current
state-specific and demographic data for arthritis, severe joint pain, and
physical inactivity. These data can extend collaborations among CDC, state
health departments, and community organizations to increase access to and use
of arthritis-appropriate, evidence-based interventions to help participants
reduce joint pain and improve physical function and quality of life.¶¶¶

* Except for age groups, estimates were age-standardized to the 2000 projected U.S. population aged ≥18 years using three groups (18-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years): https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdfpdf icon.  
† Respondents were classified as having arthritis if they responded "yes" to
the question "Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care
professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or
fibromyalgia?" Overall, 144,099 respondents reported arthritis.  
§ Severe joint pain was defined as a response of 7-10 to "Please think about
the past 30 days, keeping in mind all of your joint pain or aching and whether
or not you have taken medication. On a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain or
aching and 10 is pain or aching as bad as it can be, during the past 30 days,
how bad was your joint pain on average?" Overall, 141,744 (98.4%) respondents
with arthritis had severe joint pain data available.  
¶ Physical inactivity was defined as reporting "no" to the question "During
the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any
physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf,
gardening, or walking for exercise?" Overall, 135,160 (93.8%) respondents with
arthritis had physical inactivity data available.  
** Categories might not sum to sample total because of missing responses for
some variables.  
†† Among adults aged ≥18 years with arthritis.  
§§ Persons who identified as Hispanic might be of any race. Persons who
identified with a racial group were all non-Hispanic.  
¶¶ Estimate is potentially unreliable because the relative standard error was
between 20% and 30%.  
*** Federal poverty level is the ratio of total family income to federal
poverty level per family size. Overall, 35,648 respondents had missing data.  
††† Sexual orientation was not asked in every state. The 27 states that asked
sexual orientation were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington, and Wisconsin. A total of 1,049 respondents refused to answer.

* Estimates were age-standardized to the 2000 projected U.S. population aged ≥18 years using three groups (18-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years).  
† Respondents were classified as having arthritis if they responded "yes" to
the question "Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care
professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or
fibromyalgia?"  
§ Severe joint pain was defined as a response of 7-10 to "Please think about
the past 30 days, keeping in mind all of your joint pain or aching and whether
or not you have taken medication. On a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain or
aching and 10 is pain or aching as bad as it can be, during the past 30 days,
how bad was your joint pain on average?"  
¶ Physical inactivity was defined as reporting "no" to the question "During
the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any
physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf,
gardening, or walking for exercise?"  
** Among adults aged ≥18 years with arthritis.
