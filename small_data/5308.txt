Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the
world. It spreads primarily through saliva. EBV can cause infectious
mononucleosis, also called mono, and other illnesses. Most people will get
infected with EBV in their lifetime and will not have any symptoms. Mono
caused by EBV is most common among teens and adults.
