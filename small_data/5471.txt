Epidemiology is the basic science of public health genomics, concerned with
understanding how human and pathogen genomic variation affects the
distribution of disease in populations .

The Office of Public Health Genomics tracks epidemiologic study results in our
weekly horizon scan and Advanced Molecular Detection Clips and deposits
relevant publications in the Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base.

In addition, the Office established the Human Genome Epidemiology Network
(HuGENet) to help translate human genetic research findings into opportunities
for preventive medicine and public health. For more than a decade, HuGENet has
advanced a population perspective on human genetic variation in health and
disease through data synthesis, interpretation, and dissemination.
