                Description: Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most important preventable causes of infertility. Untreated, about 10-15%  of women with chlamydia or gonorrhea will develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can lead to infertility and potentially fatal tubal (ectopic) pregnancy.

#### CDC Recommends Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening of All Sexually Active
Women Under 25

![crib](/std/infertility/images/inf2.jpg)

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are important preventable causes of pelvic
inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. Untreated, about 10-15% of women
with chlamydia will develop PID. Chlamydia can also cause fallopian tube
infection without any symptoms. PID and "silent" infection in the upper
genital tract may cause permanent damage to the fallopian tubes, uterus, and
surrounding tissues, which can lead to infertility.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * An estimated 2.86 million cases of chlamydia and 820,000 cases of gonorrhea occur annually in the United States.*
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Most women infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea have no symptoms.

CDC recommends annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screening of **all sexually
active women younger than 25 years, as well as older women with risk factors**
such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually
transmitted infection.

* Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the first and second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States. In 2018, a total of 1,758,668 cases of chlamydia and 583,405 cases of gonorrhea were reported to CDC from 50 states and the District of Columbia. The number of reported cases is lower than the estimated total number because infected people are often unaware of, and do not seek treatment for, their infections and because screening for chlamydia is still not routine in many clinical settings.
