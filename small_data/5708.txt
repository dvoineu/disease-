# Sodium

Minus

Related Pages

The body needs a small amount of sodium to function, but most Americans
consume too much sodium. High sodium consumption can raise blood pressure, and
high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.1 Most
of the sodium we consume is in the form of salt.

## How does salt affect blood pressure?
