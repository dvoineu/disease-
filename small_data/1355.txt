### New York Reduces Tobacco Use Among Youth and Underserved Populations

New York State's Tobacco Control Program, run by the State's Bureau of Tobacco
Control, is known for its effective and evidence-based work with local
communities across the state. The Tobacco Control Program and these
communities collaborate to prevent illness, disability, and death caused by
tobacco. Together, they have greatly reduced the percentage of New York adults
who smoke and have brought the percentage of New York youth who smoke to
record lows.1,2

![Running on a bridge in New York](/tobacco/about/osh/programs-in-action/new-
york/images/running-new-york-bridge.jpg)

Despite this progress, 28,200 New York State residents die from tobacco-
related illnesses each year and more than 20% of New York high school students
currently use e-cigarettes.2,3 Community leaders in New York have taken
significant steps to reduce tobacco use, but there is a risk that local
tobacco control efforts will be sidelined because of competing public health
priorities. The Tobacco Control Program and its local partners use state,
local, and national data to keep their communities interested in reducing
tobacco-related disease, disparities, and death.

### New York Uses Data to Inform Local Action

The New York Tobacco Control Program and its local partners understand the
importance of using data to motivate community partners and guide decision-
making. The program has sophisticated data collection and analysis
capabilities.

Tobacco Control Program staff:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Gather local data on beliefs and attitudes about tobacco use and tobacco marketing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Provide up-to-date, relevant, local data when meeting with community members, youth organizations, and policy makers to guide decision-making.

### Reducing the Toll of Tobacco in New York

Higher tobacco retail density is associated with greater tobacco use among
adolescents and decreased quit attempts for adult cigarette smokers who want
to quit. It also contributes to racial and socioeconomic disparities in
tobacco use. Reducing the number of retailers that sell tobacco products in an
area may prevent youth initiation and increase quit attempts.4 In addition, a
large number of pharmacies sell tobacco products, and often more cheaply than
other stores.5 Increasing the price of tobacco products is the single most
effective way to reduce tobacco use.6

Relying on local, state, and national data provided by the Tobacco Control
Program, community leaders in local areas across New York State have taken
steps to reduce the toll of tobacco on young people and underserved
populations.

For example, in 2016 and 2017:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Niskayuna, the Village of Tannersville, and Sullivan County prohibited tobacco retailers from being located near schools.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * New York City raised the minimum prices of all tobacco products and established a new tax of 10% for non-cigarette tobacco products. The minimum price for a pack of cigarettes, including tax, is $13 per pack--the highest pack price in the United States. New York City also adopted simultaneous restrictions on the type and number of retailers who can sell tobacco in New York City, resulting in a 7% decrease in the number of tobacco retailers and 510 pharmacies no longer selling tobacco products in the city.7
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Rockland County prohibited tobacco sales in pharmacies, reducing the number of retailers selling tobacco in the county by 10%.8

Ed Day, the Rockland County Executive, relied upon national and local data to
better understand issues related to the sale of tobacco products in
pharmacies. Mr. Day said the following:

There exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoke causes cancer,
cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and negative birth outcomes among
other serious and chronic diseases . . . . [E]ach year over 13,000 New Yorkers
are diagnosed with lung cancer with about 9,000 people dying of this disease.
Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer and [secondhand smoke] also
increases the risk for lung cancer. . . . Access to tobacco products remains a
major problem. Our pharmacies should be sites of health and treatment
modalities, not places where these addictive tobacco products are readily
available and sold.

CDC's scientific information, data resources, and funding for state tobacco
control and evaluation staff have been a key piece of New York's tobacco
control success. These tools have helped New Yorkers understand the issues and
educate their communities, resulting in measures to prevent the harms caused
by tobacco use.
