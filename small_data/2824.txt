A community health worker (CHW) is a frontline public health worker who is a
trusted member or has a particularly good understanding of the community
served. A CHW serves as a liaison between health and social services and the
community to facilitate access to services and to improve the quality and
cultural competence of service delivery.

The resources on this page are collected from programs across CDC that host
materials pertinent to CHWs. These resources should be helpful not only to
CHWs but also to those who work with them. Each description identifies which
of the following audiences are most likely to find the resources useful:

Asthma

 **Evidence Summary: Control Asthma**  
CDC's 6|18 Initiative includes a payer intervention to expand access to home
visits by licensed professionals or qualified lay health workers to improve
asthma self-management education and reduce home asthma triggers. This
intervention, based on the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention
Program  guidelines, expands access for individuals whose asthma is not well-
controlled with medical management and intensive self-management education.
Evidence cited references the engagement of CHWs to provide asthma self-
management education as well as to decrease exposure to indoor asthma
triggers.

The New Hampshire Colorectal Cancer Screening Program (NHCRCSP) patient
navigation model has been highly effective in increasing the completion and
quality of colonoscopy screening among these groups. The results of a
comparison group study showed that NHCRCSP-navigated patients were 11 times
more likely to complete colonoscopy than non-navigated patients. Given its
success, CDC and NHCRCSP developed a manual to help others replicate the
model. This manual provides specific information and tools to replicate the
NHCRCSP patient navigation model. We provide detailed information on
implementing a model that improves completion of colonoscopy and follow-up,
increases patients' knowledge about their tests and results, and improves
overall screening quality and patient satisfaction.

services reimbursable under Medicaid, and the state regulates CHW training,
supervision, enrollment criteria, and billing policy. In Massachusetts, broad-
based policies combined with consistent and powerful advocacy from the leaders
of the CHW workforce, together with state public health partners, have secured
the ongoing integration of CHWs in state health reform efforts.
