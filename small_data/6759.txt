Lost and Found: Reuniting with Loved Ones in an Emergency  
More than a collection of names, phone numbers, and street addresses, an
Emergency Action Plan is an instruction manual for how to stay healthy, stay
informed, and stay connected in an emergency.

It's important that everyone in your household know how to inform family,
friends, and caregivers of their well-being and whereabouts when a disaster
strikes. Cellphones, the internet, and social media play a key role in staying
connected. In an emergency, text messaging and online platforms, like the
American Red Cross' Safe and Well websiteexternal icon and Facebook's Safety
Check feature, can be used to let loved ones know you are safe.

But what if the people you want to reunite with don't have cellphones, social
media, or even thumbs? If you're a parent, a family caregiver, or a pet owner,
your Emergency Action Plan should also account for vulnerable populations,
such as children, older adults, and pets.

Protecting Our Future: Emergency Preparedness and Children's Mental Health  
Among the many lessons learned during the 2017 Hurricane season, we recognized
that addressing children's mental and behavioral health needs is a major
concern in hurricane-affected areas.

CDC's At Risk Task Force (ARTF) was established in 2017 to ensure
identification and prioritization of the mental and physical health needs of
at-risk populations, including children. ARTF's first Emergency Operations
Center (EOC) activation was on Aug. 31, 2017, in response to Hurricane Harvey,
the first of three consecutive hurricanes to hit the United States and its
territories in a five-week period. ARTF's mission was to address the needs of
at-risk populations in affected areas throughout the response and recovery
phases.

Early in the response, it became clear that the emotional impact of the storms
and the mental health needs of people, particularly children, affected were a
critical area of focus. ARTF worked closely with federal and non-government
agencies to address these needs so that children and families had the best
chance for recovery.
