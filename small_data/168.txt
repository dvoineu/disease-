Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic
worms. Although the worms that cause schistosomiasis are not found in the
United States,  people are infected worldwide. In terms of impact this disease
is second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease.
Schistosomiasis is considered one of the neglected tropical diseases
(NTDs).The parasites that cause schistosomiasis live in certain types of
freshwater snails. The infectious form of the parasite, known as cercariae,
emerge from the snail into the water. You can become infected when your skin
comes in contact with contaminated freshwater. Most human infections are
caused by _Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium_ , or _S. japonicum_.
