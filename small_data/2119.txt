# Key Injury and Violence Data

Injuries and violence affect everyone, regardless of age, race, or economic
status. In the first half of life, more Americans die from violence and
injuries -- such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, or homicides -- than from
any other cause, including cancer, HIV, or the flu. This makes injury the
leading cause of death among persons 1-44.

## Injury- and violence-related deaths are only part of the problem

Each year 214,000 people die from injury--1 person every 3 minutes.1 But these
deaths are on the tip of the iceberg. Each year, millions of people are
injured and survive. They are faced with life-long mental, physical, and
financial problems.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * 2.8 million people were hospitalized due to injuries in 20152
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * 27.6 million people were treated in an emergency department for injuries in 20152

Injury and violence also has an alarming economic toll. The total costs of
injuries and violence in the United States was $671 billion in 2013. The costs
associated with fatal injuries was $214 billion while nonfatal injuries
accounted for over $457 billion.3
