Protecting workers from mosquito bites can prevent diseases.

Zika virus disease (Zika) is caused by the Zika virus and is spread to people
primarily from the bite of an infected _Aedes_ species mosquito. These
mosquitoes bite most actively in the daytime but also bite at night. There is
currently no vaccine to prevent Zika infection.

NIOSH and OSHA developed guidance for protecting workersexternal icon from
occupational exposure to Zika virus. NIOSH has also developed fact sheets for
outdoor workers, U.S. businesses and business travelers, healthcare and
laboratory workers, and a fact sheet and poster for cruise ship workers. For
updated Zika information visit CDC Zika.

Which workers are at risk?

Information for all workers at risk is available at OSHA/NIOSH Interim Zika

People usually do not get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they rarely
die of Zika.

Where are workers at risk?

Workers at risk include those who work in or travel to areas with Zika . Local
transmission of Zika virus has been reported in two areas of Miami,
Floridaimage icon, three U.S. territories: the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, and multiple countries. For the
most current information about where Zika is found, visit the CDC Areas with
Zika and Zika Travel Information.

Those who work or travel in an area with Zika should take steps to prevent
Zika.
