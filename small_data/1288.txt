## COPD Death Rates in the United States

2014](/copd/images/COPD_Mortality_Trend_1999-2014.png)



Printable Version Cdc-pdf[PDF 202KB]



Although age-adjusted death rates for COPD declined among US men from 1999
(57.0 per 100,000) to 2014 (44.3 per 100,000), death rates have not changed
significantly among US women (35.3 per 100,000 in 1999 and 35.6 per 100,000 in
2014). Age-adjusted death rates varied between states (see figure below) in
2014 and ranged from 15.3 per 100,000 in Hawaii to 62.8 per 100,000 in
Kentucky. States with the highest COPD death rates are clustered along the
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.

![Map of COPD prevalence in the United States 2014 displaying age-standardized
death rates for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\), by State.
State rates are grouped into quintiles. Data were obtained from the National
Vital Statistics System at http://wonder.cdc.gov. COPD as the underlying cause
of death was defined by ICD-10 codes J40-J44. Death rates are reported per
100,000 population and were age-standardized to the 2000 US standard
population. Age standardized Death Rate per 100,000. 15.3 to 34.6 –
California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Utah, Virginia. 34.7 to 38.6 –
Alaska, Florida, Illinois, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin. 38.7 to 44.5 – Arizona, Delaware, Georgia,
Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Dakota,
Texas. 44.6 to 49.7 – Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina. 49.8 to 62.8 – Alabama, Arkansas,

## COPD Prevalence in the United States

![The figure shows age-adjusted prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease \(COPD\) among adults in the United States during 2014.  The
prevalence of COPD varies considerably by state, from <4% in Hawaii, Colorado,
and Utah to >9% in Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The states
with the highest COPD prevalence are clustered along the Ohio and lower
Mississippi Rivers. Age-adjusted prevalence of COPD by state. 3.5% to 4.7% –
Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, North
Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, Puerto Rico. 4.8% to 5.6% – Illinois, Iowa, Maryland,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Texas, Vermont. 5.7% to 6.4% – Delaware, District of Columbia, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington,
Wyoming. 6.5% to 7.5% – Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina.

Using the BRFSS COPD Data Cdc-pdf[PDF - 97KB]



Although the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey
provides data critical for monitoring national and state population health, it
does not have sufficient samples to produce direct survey estimates for most
counties or subcounty areas. Therefore, BRFSS data were used to develop
statistical models estimating COPD prevalence at different geographic levels,
including counties, congressional districts, and census tracts. These
estimates could be used in a variety of contexts and meet the diverse small-
area health data needs of local policy makers, program planners, and
communities for public health program planning and evaluation.

The maps below present model-based COPD prevalence by county, congressional
district, and census tract.1
