Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch

_Elizabethkingia_ is a genus of bacteria commonly found in the environment
worldwide and has been detected in soil, river water and reservoirs. However,
it rarely makes people sick. Cases are diagnosed through culture of body
fluids, most often blood testing. _Elizabethkingia_ has mostly caused
meningitis in newborn babies and meningitis or bloodstream and respiratory
infections in people with weakened immune systems. About 5-10 cases per state
per year are reported in the United States, with a few small, localized
outbreaks reported in both the United States and other countries, usually in
healthcare settings.
