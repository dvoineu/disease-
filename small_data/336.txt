CDC monitors alcohol use among women of childbearing age in the United States.
These data are important to help reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies by
identifying groups of women at increased risk and designing prevention
programs aimed at reducing risk behaviors and improving pregnancy outcomes.

The data are collected using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). The BRFSS is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone
survey. To determine the potential number of women at risk for an alcohol-
exposed pregnancy, data from the BRFSS are analyzed for women aged 18-44 years
in all 50 states. Women are asked about their use of alcohol during the 30
days before the survey.

The following patterns of alcohol drinking are examined:

                      * Any alcohol use (one or more drinks)
                      * Binge drinking (4 or more drinks on any one occasion).

### State Prevalence Rates

Prevalence estimates vary from state to state and region to region. View your
state's alcohol consumption rate in 2016.
