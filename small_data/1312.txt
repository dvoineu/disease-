### About the Study

CDC funded two research sites, the University of South Carolina (principal
investigator Robert E. McKeown, PhD) and the University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center (principal investigator Mark L. Wolraich, MD).

The study included children in these two communities from six school districts
with diverse populations from varied geographical settings. Because the study
population was drawn from a school-based sample and followed through multiple
waves of data collection, it provided information on ADHD symptoms and
diagnosis in communities and children's development over time.

The baseline study conducted between 2002 and 2006 included a 2-step screening
process. First, teachers and parents of over 10,000 public school elementary
students (kindergarten through 6th grade) in the selected school districts
were asked about signs and symptoms of ADHD in these children. Next, students
with a high number of indicators from that screening who were considered high
risk for ADHD were invited for an in-depth assessment. Similarly, a subset of
students with a low number of indicators who were considered low risk for ADHD
were selected as a comparison group and invited for in-depth assessment.

This method of selecting children was designed to identify two groups of
children: (1) children who were already diagnosed with ADHD and (2) children
who were likely to have ADHD, but had not yet been diagnosed with the
condition, so as to be able to learn more about their development over time.

The students identified at the baseline assessment were invited to participate
in additional studies over time as they progressed into middle and high
school. The purpose was to track how children diagnosed with ADHD or likely to
have ADHD changed and developed over time, and what role ADHD played in this
development over time. This study was different from many other studies of
children diagnosed with ADHD because it included children from the community--
not enrolled through clinic visits--so as to get the most comprehensive
picture of the full spectrum of children with ADHD.

### About the Measures

The study included information collected from parents, teachers, and the
child. The follow-up project spanned five years and included annual in-depth
interviews, semi-annual data collection on a few measures, and brief quarterly
contacts.

*Measure was modified for follow-up study

1 The ADHD treatment questionnaire and updates to Events and Demographics were
also collected quarterly  
2 These data were collected in 2 districts only, for an additional study on
tic disorders  
3 For participants who did not attend Wave 1, this was administered at the
first subsequent visit

Note: For the baseline, both sites collected a core set of measures but also
added site-specific measures of interest. For the two waves of follow-up,
sites chose to use very similar assessment protocols. South Carolina was able
to conduct two additional waves of information collection.

### Results from the study

Data analysis is continuing. You can find out about the results to date by
reading the key findings below.

##### Key Findings

Impact of ADHD and Other Mental Conditions  
Data from a community study show that children with ADHD and other conditions
are more likely to have problems with friendships and to get into trouble in
school or with the police.  
(Published November 25, 2015)

Estimates of ADHD Change Depending on Which ADHD Criteria Are Applied  
Using more criteria to diagnose children with ADHD decreases the percentage of
children who fit the diagnosis.

Persistence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms **  
** Data from a community sample show that certain ADHD symptoms can often last
into adolescence.
