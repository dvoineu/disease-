*Includes reported confirmed and probable Zika virus disease cases per the CSTE case definitions.

†Presumptive viremic blood donors are people who reported no symptoms at the
time of donating blood, but whose blood tested positive when screened for the
presence of Zika virus RNA by the blood collection agency. Some presumptive
viremic blood donors develop symptoms after their donation or may have had
symptoms in the past.  These individuals may be reported as both Zika virus
disease cases and presumptive viremic blood donors.

‡Includes 2 cases in Florida and 5 cases in Texas that were acquired through
presumed local mosquito-borne transmission.
