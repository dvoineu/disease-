Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | National health statistics reported by race/ethnicity are based
on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards (1). The OMB
guidelines define race as a social definition rather than an attempt to define
genetics, biology, or anthropology. Hispanic origin (ethnicity) and race are
separate concepts, and thus collection of race and ethnicity data are
collected using separate questions in federal data systems. Hispanic persons
may be of any race, and includes persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban,
Central and South American and/or Spanish origins. Race is based on the family
respondent's description of his or her own race background, as well as the
race background of other family members. The 1997 OMB race groups are white,
black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, and Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. A person may report more than one race, but
OMB guidelines are based on the race that the respondent reports best
represents their or their child's race. Additional categorization methods may
separately classify those choosing more than one race as "multiple race."  
Significance to disparities | Higher asthma prevalence among specific
race/ethnic groups translates into a higher proportion of those groups at risk
of adverse asthma outcomes such as exacerbations, need for emergent care, and
in rare cases, death. Non-Hispanic black children had a growing prevalence
rate compared to non-Hispanic white children from 2001-2010(2). Alaska
Native/American Indian and multiracial children also have higher rates of
asthma compared to non-Hispanic white children(3). Puerto Rican children have
among the highest rates, while Mexican children have among the lowest rates of
current asthma prevalence(4,5). Data for asthma outcomes (such as
hospitalizations) by Hispanic origin in national data sets are more limited.  
Data considerations | In federal health surveys, respondents self-reported
race/ethnicity, or proxy reported race/ethnicity for other family members.
Beginning with the 2003 NHIS, in cases where "other race" was mentioned with
one or more OMB race groups, the "other race" response is dropped and the OMB
race group information is retained on the NHIS data file. In cases where
"other race" is the only response, race is treated as missing and imputed in

What is your best estimate of the total family income of all family members from all sources, before taxes in the last calendar year?"_

This question is preceded in the National Health Interview Survey by detailed
questions about income to prompt respondents to count all the sources used to
compute poverty status. According to US Census definition, before-tax money
income for the family is totaled, and includes earnings, unemployment
compensation, worker's compensation, Social Security, Supplemental Security
Income, public assistance, veteran's payments, survivor benefits, pension or
retirement income, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, income from estates,
trusts, educational assistance, alimony, child support, assistance from
outside the household, and other miscellaneous sources. Noncash benefits (food
stamps, housing subsidies) and capital gains or losses do not count. Money
income for all family members are included (but non- relatives, such as
housemates, do not count). See https://www.census.gov/topics/income-
poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.htmlexternal icon

Note that nonresponse for this question is relatively high in the NHIS.
Therefore, missing responses are multiply imputed to reduce the bias that
would result if the other health information associated with these missing
responses were excluded from analysis. See the NHIS Description for additional
information (ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS
/Dataset_Documentation/NHIS/2013/srvydesc.pdfpdf icon)

_Survey summary variable for poverty status (Source: NHIS)_ :  
Reported family income is used to calculate the ratio of family income to the
poverty threshold (RAT_CAT contained in the family file). US Census federal
poverty thresholds are defined annually in dollar amounts according to family
size and composition.

_Survey summary variable for family size (Source: NHIS)_ :  
Family type and structure is determined with a series of screening questions
in the NHIS and summarized to characterize family size and structure (FM_SIZE
and FM_KIDS contained in the family file, which are used to calculate the
survey summary variable for poverty status described above).

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | Based on the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical
Policy Directive 14, the Census Bureau establishes a set of income thresholds
that vary by family size and composition. If family income is less that the
family poverty threshold, that family is categorized as poor (<100% federal
income threshold). The official poverty definition uses money income before
taxes and does not include capital gain or noncash benefits (e.g., food
stamps).  
Significance to disparities | Current asthma prevalence is significantly
higher among children with family income below the federal poverty level(1).
While national data on outcomes is not generally available by income level, it
has been well documented that risk factors for asthma and for poor asthma
outcomes are higher among lower income groups, including housing quality,
stress, family resources to manage chronic conditions, etc. (2-4)  
Data considerations | Nonresponse for family income and personal earnings in
the NHIS are high (~20%, depending on survey year). To address this
limitation, the National Center for Health Statistics provides multiply
imputed values for family income variables from 1997 onward. It is highly
recommended to use imputed income values when analyzing NHIS income data.
Detailed technical documentation is available for each survey year (e.g.,
2003: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2003imputedincome.htm)

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education
that an individual has completed (distinct from the current grade level).
Categories used by US Census for adults 18 years and older are more detailed
than those used by the NHIS: less than high school (none, 1-4th grade, 5-6th
grade, 7-8th grade, 9th grade, 10th grade, 11th grade), HS graduate, some
college no degree, associate's degree (occupational, academic), bachelor's
degree, master's degree, professional degree, doctoral degree.

Parental educational attainment is associated with measures of well-being
including school readiness, educational achievement, incidence of low
birthweight, and health-related behaviors(1). Health literacy as well as
health-related behaviors, such as smoking, may be related to asthma management
and outcomes. (2, 3)  
  
Significance to disparities | Although the percentage of children with a
parent with less than a high school diploma or equivalent has increased since
the 1970s, children of minority race/ethnicity have a lower percentage of
resident mothers and fathers with at least a bachelor's degree. (1, 4)
Furthermore, children in single-parent households were more likely to live
with a parent who had not attained a bachelor's degree or higher, or had not
completed high school(4). The factors of a single-parent household and low
educational achievement may compound the risk of suboptimal management of
asthma.  
Data considerations | Assessment of highest level of educational achievement
in the family requires determination of family structure and a knowledgeable
respondent about the educational achievement of all adults in the family.

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator
environmental risk factor to help more precisely measure disparities.
Therefore, the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | Exposure to environmental factors inside homes can exacerbate
asthma symptoms (2, 3). According to the National Asthma Education and
Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, in addition to receiving appropriate
medical treatment, asthma symptoms can be controlled by avoiding exposure to
environmental allergens and irritants (1).

Exposure to environmental factors inside home can be assessed at state-level
using the child ACBS. The ACBS has several measures to assess indoor air
quality (saw or smelled mold, saw a cockroach, anyone smoked inside home, saw
mice or rats; pets allowed in bedroom, gas used for cooking, wood burning
fireplace or stove used, gas appliance used). For this indicator, a
combination of mold, cockroach, and ETS related measures is recommended. These
are the exposures highlighted in the Institute of Medicine report as having
sufficient scientific evidence of association with exacerbation of asthma(3).

Healthy People 2020: Respiratory Diseases Objectives (RD-7.5): Increase the
proportion of persons with current asthma who have been advised by a health
professional to change things in their home, school, and work environments to
reduce exposure to irritants or allergens to which they are sensitive
according to National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)
guidelines (https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-
objectives/topic/respiratory-diseases/objectivesexternal icon)(2).  
  
Significance to disparities | Among sensitive individuals, exposure to
cockroach, ETS, fungi, or molds is associated with the exacerbation of asthma.

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of risk of
having asthma and/or asthma complications to help more precisely measure
disparities. Therefore, the denominator will depend on the analysis being
conducted.  
Background | Body mass index (BMI) is calculated from measured weight and
height to reliably indicate body fatness for most children (weight/height2).
BMI does not measure body fat directly, but correlates with direct measures,
such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. It is an inexpensive alternative for
direct measures of body fat.

Unlike adults who have static ranges of BMI that indicate weight status
(normal weight versus overweight versus obese), for children ranges of BMI
that indicate weight status vary with age and sex. Percentiles for BMI for age
and sex have been calculated using a normative, nationally representative
sample of children aged 2-19 years by CDC(1). Individual BMI is plotted on the
BMI age- and sex-specific growth charts to obtain a percentile ranking for
that individual. Weight status category for children is based on percentile
ranking rather than directly on BMI.  
  
Significance to disparities | Overweight and obese children have increased
risk of developing asthma compared to children of normal weight status(2).
Higher BMI values also increased the risk for seasonal asthma exacerbations
among children with persistent asthma(3).

For children younger than 2 years, recumbent length is measured rather than standing height. Therefore, the standard BMI calculation and percentiles for age do not apply to this age group. For children under 2 years of age, weight-for-length percentiles can be reported, but these also do not correlate with BMI percentile-defined weight status categories.

An analysis comparing measured and reported weight in national surveys found that classification of young children as obese was increased using reported height and weight, most likely because of underestimation of height of young children. Use of measured rather than parent-reported height and weight was recommended(4).

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | The NHIS determines health insurance coverage at the time of
participation in the survey. Uninsured persons are those not covered by
private insurance, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),
state-sponsored or other government- sponsored health plans, Medicare, or
military plans. Person with only Indian Health Service coverage, or with only
a private plan that paid for one type of service (e.g., accidents or dental
care) are considered to have no health insurance coverage(1).

Recommendations found in the Guideline Implementation Panel (GIP) report
specifically recommend examining insurance coverage gaps due to the link to
possible underutilization of routine (non-emergent) care. The GIP report also
recommends increasing surveillance of disparities related to insurance
status(2).  
  
Significance to disparities | Lack of insurance coverage differs significantly
by race and ethnicity(3). Patients with chronic illnesses without insurance
are less likely to visit a health care professional, not to have a usual site
for healthcare, or to identify the emergency room as their usual source of
care(3). Lack of health insurance is also associated with reduced use of
preventive services and medical treatment(4).  
Data considerations | Uninsured populations may be less likely to seek medical
care. Those without insurance with less opportunity for health care encounters
may be more likely to have undiagnosed asthma.

The NHIS definition of lack of health insurance is based on reported health
insurance coverage at the time of survey participation, but does not account
for periods of gaps in coverage. That is, persons insured at the time of NHIS
participation may have only intermittent coverage and periods of lack of
insurance which are not detected.

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | The NHIS determines health insurance coverage at the time of
participation in the survey(1).

Recommendations found in the Guideline Implementation Panel (GIP) report
specifically recommend examining insurance coverage gaps due to the link to
possible underutilization of routine (non-emergent) care. The GIP report also
recommends increasing surveillance of disparities related to insurance
status(2).  
  
Significance to disparities | Lack of insurance coverage differs significantly
by race and ethnicity(3). Patients with chronic illnesses without insurance
are less likely to visit a health care professional, not to have a usual site
for healthcare, or to identify the emergency room as their usual source of
care(3). Lack of health insurance is also associated with reduced use of
preventive services and medical treatment(4).

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | Having a usual source of care is associated with higher rates of
preventive care and fewer acute care visits and hospitalizations(1). Uninsured
children without a usual source of care report higher rates of unmet need(2).

Recommendations found in the Guideline Implantation Panel (GIP) report include
encouraging asthma patients to establish a medical home as part of a
healthcare delivery system. The GIP report also recommends increasing
surveillance of disparities related to access to medical homes(3).

Healthy People 2020 is the most recent set of objectives developed with 4
overarching goals: attain high quality of life, eliminate disparities, create
social and physical environment to promote good health, and promote healthy
behaviors across all life stages. The topic area of Access to Health Services
has 9 main objectives. More information is available at:
https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Access-to-Health-
Servicesexternal icon Healthy People 2020: AHS-5.1 Increase the proportion of
persons who have a specific source of ongoing care  
  
Significance to disparities | Prevalence of a medical home in US children has
been shown to vary by insurance type, race and ethnicity, and primary language
spoken. Prevalence was lower in publically insured children compared to
privately insured children, racial and ethnic minorities, and non-English
language speakers(4).

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | The family perspective in paying medical bills is important to
consider given the financial risk to the entire family unit of significant
expenses. Although a child may have health insurance, insurance coverage among
family members may differ. In 2012, 16.5% of US families had problems paying
medical bills in the past 12 months. Low income families had the highest rate
of difficulty paying medical bills (26%), as did families with one or more
children (21.8%)(1).

Healthy People is a federal interagency effort to identify a comprehensive set
of 10-year national health objectives. Healthy People 2020 is the most recent
set of objectives developed with 4 overarching goals: attain high quality of
life, eliminate disparities, create social and physical environment to promote
good health, and promote healthy behaviors across all life stages. The topic
area of Access to Health Services has 9 main objectives. More information is
available at: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-
objectives/topic/Access-to-Health-Servicesexternal icon. The Healthy People
2020 objective "AHS-1.1 Increase the proportion of persons with health
insurance" has a stated goal of reduction in burden from large medical bills.  
  
Significance to disparities | Poverty status in asthma patients has been shown
to have differing impacts based on race and ethnicity(2). In the 2010 Asthma
Call Back Survey, 13.5% of adults and 5.4% of children reported cost as a
barrier to seeing a primary care physician. 18.6% of adults and 9.8% of
children reported cost as a barrier to filling a prescription asthma
medication. Black and Hispanic adults were more likely to report cost as a
barrier to asthma care than white adults(3).

There may be a difference in those who had difficulty paying a bill due to hospitalization versus those who had difficulty paying a co-pay or other smaller bill.

Denominator definition | This measure is intended as an indicator of
socioeconomic status to help more precisely measure disparities. Therefore,
the denominator will depend on the analysis being conducted.  
Background | Recommendations found in the Guideline Implementation Panel (GIP)
report specifically recommends encouraging asthma patients to establish a
medical home as part of a healthcare delivery system. The GIP report also
recommends increasing surveillance of disparities related to access to medical
homes(1).

Healthy People is a federal interagency effort to identify a comprehensive set
of 10-year national health objectives. Healthy People 2020 is the most recent
set of objectives developed with 4 overarching goals: attain high quality of
life, eliminate disparities, create social and physical environment to promote
good health, and promote healthy behaviors across all life stages. The topic
area of Access to Health Services has 9 main objectives. More information is

AHS-3 Increase the proportion of persons with a usual primary care provider  
  
Significance to disparities | Uninsured people with asthma are less likely to
have a primary care physician(2). Insurance status significantly differs by
race and ethnicity (3).  
Data considerations | The survey question does not specify the site of care.
To function as an indicator of receiving care in a medical home, as advised by
the American Academy of Pediatrics(4), having a personal doctor should be
considered in the context of other indicators such as having a usual source of
care.
