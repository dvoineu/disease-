## Environmental Health

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community you live in, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
negatively affected.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting state and
city public health programs, educating communities, and providing scientific
knowledge. We help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a
healthy environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness
caused by environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might
be exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing health care costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

## Climate and Health Program

**The Climate and Health Program works to prevent and adapt to the possible
health effects of climate change. The program identifies the populations most
vulnerable to these impacts, predicts future trends, creates systems to detect
and respond to emerging health threats, and designs programs to manage health
risks now and in the future. The climate change funding for CDC represents the
only U.S. Government investment dedicated to preparing our nation to
anticipate and adapt to the health effects linked to climate change.**

## Public Health in Action: Climate and Health Impacts around the Country

The Climate and Health Program is preparing communities around the nation for
the potential health effects of climate change events such as more frequent
and severe heat waves, droughts, flooding and extreme weather. Since its
beginning in 2009, the program has:

Through CDC funding and technical support, eight state and two city health departments are applying advanced methods to address the health effects of climate change (San Francisco, New York City, New York State, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arizona and Maine).

Seven research projects are analyzing historical trends to demonstrate the environment-health link and develop models that will help health agencies predict and prepare for future health effects.
