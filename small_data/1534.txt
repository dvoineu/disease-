Is there any danger from receiving extra doses of a vaccine?

Most of the time, your risk of serious side effects does not increase if you
get extra doses of a vaccine. Getting extra doses of oral vaccines, such as
rotavirus or typhoid, is not known to cause any problems. The risk of a
reaction at the injection site following certain injected vaccines, such as
DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) or pneumococcal vaccine, increases
if the doses are not separated by the recommended amounts of timeCdc-pdf. In
these cases, it is the _spacing_ of the doses, _not the number_ of doses, that
creates the risk. These reactions can be unpleasant, but they are not life-
threatening. Any serious reaction following vaccination should be reported to
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)External.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Do you have questions about administering extra doses of vaccine antigen in a combination vaccine?

Who should get the Tdap vaccine?

![a pregnant woman speaking to a healthcare professional ](/cdc-

CDC recommends Tdap (the tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough vaccine) for:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Preteens and teens,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Pregnant women, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Adults who have never received the vaccine.

Preteens should get one dose between the ages of 11 and 12 years. Teens who
didn't get Tdap as a preteen should get one dose the next time they visit
their doctor.

If you are pregnant, you should get Tdap during each pregnancy. After you get
the shot, your body creates protective antibodies and passes some of them to
your baby before birth. These antibodies give your baby some short-term
protection against whooping cough in early life.

#### Are you a healthcare provider?

Do you have questions about who should receive Tdap? See the Summary of
Pertussis Vaccine Recommendations.

Adults should get one dose of the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine every 10
years. However, CDC recommends adults get one dose of Tdap in place of a Td
dose if they have never received Tdap. By doing so, adults boost their
protection against whooping cough. Tdap can be given no matter when you got
your last Td vaccine.

Be sure to ask your doctor any questions you have about whether you or your
family should get certain shots. Your doctor will make you aware of any
reasons you should not get the vaccine.

For more detailed information about Tdap vaccine, call 1-800-CDC-INFO and
follow the prompts to be connected with an agent (during normal business
hours).

Where can I get a copy of my (or my child's) immunization or vaccine records?

![Image of doctor holding a clipboard](/cdc-info/images/FAQ_Vaccine-Records-
small.jpg)

CDC does not store personal vaccination records. There is not a national
organization that maintains vaccination records. Some doctors, schools, and
communities might use registries (or "Immunization Information Systems") to
keep track of vaccinations. However, most often, the only existing records are
the ones you or your parents were given when the vaccines were administered,
or those in the medical record of the doctor or clinic where the vaccines were
given.

If you're having a hard time finding your or your child's vaccine records,
contact:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The doctor(s) or clinic (s) where you or your child got vaccinated,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Schools or student health centers, or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Your local or state health department.

Keep in mind that doctor's offices, clinics, and schools only keep vaccine
records for a few years.

You should also check family records, such as baby books or military records.

If you still can't find the vaccine records, you or your child may need to:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Repeat some of the vaccines, or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Get a blood test to find out if you are immune to (protected from) certain diseases.

What is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)?

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a program that allows
healthcare providers or their patients to report any health problems that
occur after a vaccination.

VAERS analyzes information from these reports and looks for patterns. If it
appears that a particular problem might be linked to a vaccine, experts will
work to determine whether the vaccine might be causing the problem, or whether
it occurred following the vaccination by chance. If the link appears to be
real, CDC might recommend new precautions for the vaccine. In extremely rare
circumstances, a vaccine could be removed from the market.

It's important to remember that a report to VAERS does not prove that a
problem was caused by a vaccine--only that the problem occurred after the
vaccination. In fact, many of the problems reported to VAERS are found not to
have been caused by vaccines. But VAERS helps CDC and FDA know when a possible
problem needs to be looked at more closely.

To learn more about VAERS, or how to report an adverse event, you can visit
the VAERS websiteExternal or call them directly at 1-800-822-7967.

Who should get the rabies vaccine?

The rabies vaccine may be given to a person after possibly coming into contact
with the rabies virus. But as a safety measure, some people should get the
shot before they get exposed, including people who are at high risk of coming
into contact with the virus, such as:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Veterinarians,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * People who work with the rabies virus, and

If you, or someone you know, has been bitten by a mammal--such as a dog, cat,
ferret, skunk, raccoon, fox, or bat--go see your doctor right away. You may
need to start the rabies vaccine series as soon as possible, before symptoms
of the illness appear.
