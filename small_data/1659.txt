AtlasPlus was created to provide an interactive platform for accessing data
collected by CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention (NCHHSTP). This interactive tool provides CDC an effective way to
disseminate data, while allowing users to observe trends and patterns by
creating detailed reports, maps, and other graphics. Recent updates to this
resource allow users to explore the latest HIV data at the national-, state-,
or county-level. Disease rates can be analyzed by demographic variables,
transmission categories, year and trends over time. In this new version, users
can also create 2 side-by-side maps or charts. New charting capabilities
include: line graphs by year; pie charts for sex; bar charts by state and
country; bar charts for age, race/ethnicity, and transmission category.
