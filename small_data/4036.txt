Information on publications describing identified interventions that generally
met the inclusion criteria is provided
(https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/interventions/). Many of the intervention research
activities represented in these publications were funded by outside sources.
In addition, many had a high level of support within their organizations
(e.g., dedicated staff). Several factors that could have contributed to
positive health outcomes in these studies were beyond the written protocols
and may have been important in the success of the intervention. These factors
may be difficult to identify or duplicate. Although 42 interventions are
presented in this report as having positive health outcomes in the research
setting, implementing these interventions solely on the basis of the
information in the published report is not feasible. The availability of the
protocol and materials needed for implementation is noted for each of the
interventions.

Investigators in many countries have published asthma intervention studies,
including (but not limited to) Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England,
Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, the United States,
and Venezuela.

Hospitals and outpatient clinics are the most common settings for identified
interventions. Schools are used in some pediatric asthma intervention studies;
community centers (e.g., such as the YMCA, churches, or day care centers) are
less frequently being used. Two asthma education programs (one in Canada and
one in Germany) have been conducted in pharmacies. Home visits are also used,
particularly when the impact of individualized interventions is being
determined on the basis of the patient's history and living conditions. The
most common example of home-based interventions found in the literature was
personalized instruction and recommendations for reduction of asthma triggers
in homes based on walk-through observations and the results of the child's
allergy skin tests.

The three deficiencies that appeared most often were as follows: a) the sample size was too small, b) the study yielded negative results, and c) the adaptation of the intervention to the United States market was unlikely (generally because of differences in the healthcare systems). Other limitations to the studies included too short a study period, no concrete health outcomes, and unconventional statistical approaches.Several active, community-based asthma programs also were identified during this investigation. Some of these programs appeared to have sound, established foundations; community support; demonstrated ongoing need; and the appropriate protocols and procedures were in place. However, they did not have published results of positive health outcomes. Because of this shortcoming, they were not included in formal review and analysis. Hopefully, some of these interventions will demonstrate positive health outcomes that can be documented in the literature and eventually included in a future review of potentially effective interventions.

Among the evaluated interventions, little consistency existed in the
definition and operation of outcome measures. For instance, improving quality
of life for a person with asthma was an objective of most interventions;
however, the definition of "quality of life" differed between studies, as did
indicators of improvement. Similarly, numerous instruments and tools were
identified to determine whether improvements had been achieved. Often the
instruments were not consistent or comparable and, in many instances, they had
not been validated.

Of the evaluated interventions that were identified as potentially effective,
most are not formatted in a manner that encourages widespread application, nor
are the protocol and materials readily accessible.

Investigators often develop protocols and educational materials that are
sufficient for their particular research study, but are not sufficiently
documented to enable others, not involved with the study, to make use of them
in an intervention setting. Written instructions for trainers that describe
how to use the course materials, detailed and sequenced lesson plan outlines,
handouts, and visual aids are costly and time consuming to produce. In the
absence of special funding for instructional development, they often are not
adequately developed.

_**Most of the community-based interventions identified were aimed at
increasing the knowledge and self-management skills of people with asthma.
Group and individual educational sessions were the most popular mechanisms
used to achieve this goal. Most of these educational interventions were based
on the concepts of self-efficacy and modeling, components of Bandura's theory
of social learning. The review identified few evaluated interventions either
designed for or tailored to Spanish or other non-English speaking populations.

Surprisingly, almost no video-based instruction or computer-based instruction
is documented as being used in the literature. Web-based instruction and
distance-learning approaches are also lacking in asthma clinical studies. When
produced, they rarely are assessed regarding impact on health outcomes.

Hand picked because they model exceptionally good asthma management behaviors
and communicate well with others, peer-instructors attend a train-the-trainer
course and teach under the direction of a senior instructor for a time. These
peer-instructors usually live in the same neighborhoods as their students,
share similar cultural and socio-economic backgrounds as their students, and
readily identify with them.

Although some interventions have been demonstrated to be potentially
effective, the interventions should be implemented in an environment that is
conducive to optimal health of persons with asthma. For example, it may be of
limited or no value to implement Open Airways for Schools in a school or
school system that does not permit ready access to asthma medications, does
not have written policies in place about care for children with asthma, does
not educate its teachers and staff about asthma, and does not limit exposure
to potential asthma triggers (e.g., tobacco smoke, pet dander, and mold).

#### Case Studies

Reading about effective intervention research is much different than knowing
whether the intervention is feasible for a particular community. To aid in
understanding the interventions, a description of the implementation of some
effective interventions has been prepared in case study format. Case studies
are provided on the following interventions:

YES WE CAN Children's Asthma Program as implemented in San Francisco, California (https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/interventions/yes_we_can.htm)

As a result of the careful review that focused on implementation of some of
these effective interventions in community (non-research) settings, the
following common "good practices" emerged.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * _**A full-time asthma education coordinator.**_  
The coordinator is responsible for the course scheduling; arranging for
instructors and facilities; enrolling participants; sending a note or calling
with reminders of class time and location; preparing handouts, visual aids,
and attendance records; attending all the sessions to support the instructors;
and ensuring continued quality from course to course. The asthma education
coordinator (likely a registered nurse or respiratory therapist) is also a
ready resource to asthma patients in the program to answer questions, help
resolve education-related issues, and make needed referrals. Finally, this
coordinator usually is responsible for intervention feedback and evaluation.

The instructional materials are fully developed with scripted outlines for
instructors use, including sequenced information that moves logically from
simple statements and ideas to the more complex concepts and applications. The
lesson plans support stated learning objectives in each lesson that describe
what participants are expected to know and to be able to do following the
instruction. When the outcome of the instruction is a learned skill, a step-
by-step description of the task is included, usually with accompanying
visuals. Common failings when performing the task are explained and cautions
are addressed as applicable. The instructor guides and lesson plans have been
tested and shown to be effective. The materials have been consciously selected
for the intended audiences; reading level, cultural appropriateness, and
visual correctness have been taken into consideration when selecting the
materials. The materials are available for use by others.

These programs are directed by one or more senior-level health professional
(usually physicians) with a clinical research background. Typically, this
leader has professional duties beyond treating patients which might include
managing a hospital clinic, teaching, or doing research. These professionals
have demonstrated inspired leadership by pioneering the development of their
programs and gaining the sustained financial and resource support from within
their institutions and within their communities to consistently carry out
these asthma interventions. They are individuals with high energy levels,
outstanding managerial capabilities, dauntless commitment, and resolve. They
are champions of the work in which they are engaged and are leaders in their
professions.

In each asthma intervention program, the directors recognize that each and
every instructor and asthma counselor must have not only the aptitude for
teaching, have good listening and communication skills, be well organized, and
have the ability to work well with people, but they must exhibit leadership
and possess the character strengths needed to help others with behavior
changes. These people are positive role models and are looked up to by program
participants and others. Once selected, they undergo formal and on-the-job
training to learn how to deliver the asthma messages most effectively.
Following training they are introduced to teaching gradually under the
direction of a more senior instructor. At no time are new instructors in these
programs expected to teach without first being trained, whether formally or
informally, to perform the work.

Participants who acquire certain behaviors and/or complete the asthma
intervention are consistently recognized and rewarded in these programs. A
certificate of completion with the child's name, the program name, and the
date of completion is signed by the program director and presented to the
participants in an informal setting, usually on the last meeting or education
date. When groups of children complete the program at the same time, parents
and invited guests often celebrate in organized parties; other programs give
the children gift certificates to a department store or a fast-food
restaurant. Parents can be awarded a food market gift certificate as
recognition for completing the education. Recognition in the form of something
of value is a cultural tradition that cross-cuts our society and is considered
to be crucial to keeping participants active and interested in any program,
especially in the early stages.

Much care is taken to secure classrooms where people easily can assemble.
Location of the buildings (e.g., near bus lines, on lighted streets, and in
areas recognized by participants as safe meeting places) is important when
selecting venues in the community, especially for evening meetings. Classrooms
are made inviting by decorating with educational props, posters, and familiar
program symbols and slogans used during the sessions. Seating and tables used
in the children's sessions are of appropriate size for children's use. Seating
in adult sessions usually consists of a large table(s); all meeting
participants have the same access to the instructor and can make eye-to-eye
contact with other participants, helping to create an egalitarian relationship
among fellow students.

Because the implemented interventions already have been demonstrated to be
effective, program evaluation can focus on process elements that ensure that
the intervention was implemented as originally designed and tested. Every
program for which a case study was prepared received participant feedback at
the end of the program as a way to assess the quality of instruction.
Questions generally centered on what elements were considered the most and
least beneficial and what was liked and not liked about the experience. Some
of these programs use a written quiz to assess instructional effectiveness.
Quiz scores provided an important point of reference about the participants'
cognitive learning levels. When several people miss the same question, the
instructional materials, the delivery of the materials, or the way the
question is worded could be to blame.
