### Quitline FAQs

What is a quitline?

Quitlines are effective, evidence-based tobacco cessation interventions that
help tobacco users quit through a variety of service offerings, including
counseling, practical information on how to quit, referral to other cessation
resources, and mailed self-help materials.1

Quitlines:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Increase a tobacco user's chances of successfully quitting (the 2008 update to the Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence determined that quitlines increased the odds of 6-month abstinence by approximately 60%)2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Are staffed by counselors who are highly trained healthcare professionals

Quitlines may offer a variety of other services, such as web-assisted tobacco
interventions and text messaging. They also offer information and support for
family, friends, and healthcare professionals who want to help tobacco users
quit.

Some state quitlines offer free cessation medications or provide tobacco users
with vouchers or discounts to receive these medications at reduced cost. Most
quitlines also offer counseling protocols and materials designed for specific
populations, such as pregnant women or smokers with chronic diseases. For
information on your state's quitline services, visit the NAQC Quitline
Mapexternal icon. Simply click on your state to view the quitline profile
page.

Are quitlines effective in helping people to quit?

Quitlines are effective, evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation. The
evidence base for tobacco cessation quitlines was established through numerous
clinical trials and meta-analyses. After an exhaustive review of the
randomized clinical trial research literature, the 2008 update to the Public
Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline Treating Tobacco Use and
Dependence concluded that quitlines increase 6-month smoking cessation quit
rates compared with no intervention (the Guideline reported quit rates among
quitline users of 12.7% for counseling alone and 28.1% for counseling plus
medication) and therefore recommended the use of quitlines to help tobacco
users quit.2 Quitlines have been shown to be a highly cost-effective
intervention that deliver high value relative to their cost when compared with
other common disease prevention interventions and medical treatments.3

Are quitline services available in every state?

Yes. All 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam
operate quitlines that can be accessed through the 1-800-QUIT-NOW quitline
(operated by the National Cancer Institute). This toll-free number
automatically transfers callers to their state quitline. This easy-to-remember
number allows for national promotion of quitline services. Healthcare
professionals can refer patients who are interested in quitting to 1-800-QUIT-
NOW.

What happens when my patient calls 1-800-QUIT-NOW?

When patients call the quitline, they will be asked about their tobacco use,
previous quit attempts, how they heard about the quitline, and some basic
demographic questions, including gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education
level. Citizenship documentation is not asked. This initial process usually
takes about 10 minutes. All information collected is kept strictly
confidential and is treated as protected health information.

Callers then receive information about the services the quitline offers. If a
caller is interested in receiving mailed self-help materials, an address is
taken and materials are typically shipped within 24 hours. If a caller would
like referrals to local cessation services or information on Web-based
cessation help, that information is provided. If a caller is interested in
receiving cessation counseling, he/she is typically transferred to a tobacco
cessation counselor. Cessation counselors are highly trained professionals who
are skilled in motivational interviewing and delivering client-centered
interventions. The counseling session, typically lasting about 30 minutes,4
may focus on creating a tailored quit plan, providing medication or decision
support in choosing medications, and discussing tips and tools for overcoming
everyday urges to smoke.

It is important to note that during times of heavy call volume (especially
during national media campaigns that promote 1-800-QUIT-NOW), a cessation
counselor may not be immediately available. In these cases, the quitline will
schedule an appropriate call-back time with the caller.

Who is eligible for quitline services?

The majority of states do not have eligibility criteria for providing quitline
counseling beyond being a state resident. Many states also require that
callers be interested in quitting tobacco in the next 30 days. However, some
states may have more detailed eligibility criteria or may prioritize multiple
call services or free medications for those meeting specific criteria (e.g.,
uninsured, Medicaid insured, etc.). For specific details on your state
quitline's eligibility criteria, visit the NAQC Quitline Mapexternal icon.

How do I refer a patient to the quitline?

After asking if a patient uses tobacco and advising them to quit if they do,
you will need to determine if they are ready to quit. For those patients who
are not ready to quit, remind them that you have resources to help them quit
when they are ready.

If a patient is ready to quit, you can refer them to your state quitline in
one of two ways:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Provide your patient with the 1-800-QUIT-NOW number and briefly explain what will happen when they call. This referral method requires your patient to make the initial call to the quitline. For example, you might say:  
_" I am happy to hear you are ready to quit and I want you to know that help
is available. Our state has a telephone-based tobacco quitline that is free
and offers help to people who want to quit. When you call you will be asked a
few questions about yourself and your tobacco use and then you will have the
opportunity to talk to a person who has been trained to help you develop a
quit plan."_

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Use your state quitline's proactive referral system. This referral method prompts the quitline to call your patient directly to start services. In most states, healthcare providers can send a referral with the patient's contact information to the state quitline through a fax or an electronic health record. This typically involves briefly explaining to the patient what will happen when the quitline calls, obtaining the patient's written consent to be contacted by the quitline, and faxing or electronically submitting the referral form. Many quitline referral programs offer feedback to referring providers to track patients' progress. To learn more about the healthcare provider referral program in your state, visit the NAQC Quitline Mapexternal icon. Click on your state to view the quitline profile page.

videoexternal icon.

How are state quitlines funded?

The majority of funding for state quitlines comes from state Master Settlement
Agreement funds, state general funds, and state tobacco taxes.4 In addition,
some quitlines have partnerships with health insurance plans and/or employers
to offer qualifying callers with expanded quitline and cessation services. To
learn more about how your state quitline is funded, visit Quitline
Administration and Financingexternal icon.

What if I have a patient who does not speak English?

You can refer Spanish-speaking patients who want to quit to **1-855-D ÉJELO-YA
(** **1-855-335-3569** **)** , which means _" Quit it now."_ This Spanish-
language quitline, which is operated by the National Cancer Institute,
functions similarly to 1-800-QUIT-NOW, with callers being automatically routed
to their state quitline where they can receive services in Spanish.

The Asian Smokers' Quitlineexternal icon, which is operated by the Moores
Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, with funding from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offers free nationwide
telephone assistance for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese speakers who want to
quit smoking.
