**Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
which are physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities that last a
lifetime.  **Often, a person with an FASD has a mix of these problems. It is
recommended that women who are pregnant or might be pregnant not drink
alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are completely preventable if a
developing baby is not exposed to alcohol before birth.

### What We Know

                      * Women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant should be aware that any level of alcohol use could harm their babies.
                      * All types of alcohol can be harmful, including all wine and beer.
                      * The baby's brain, body, and organs are developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by alcohol at any time.
                      * Alcohol use during pregnancy can also increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm (early) birth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

### What Can Be Done to Prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders

**Women Can**

                      * Talk with their healthcare providers about their plans for pregnancy, their alcohol use, and ways to prevent pregnancy if they are not planning to get pregnant.
                      * Stop drinking alcohol if they are trying to get pregnant or could get pregnant.
                      * Ask their respective partners, families, and friends to support their choice not to drink during pregnancy or while trying to get pregnant.
                      * Ask their healthcare providers or other trusted people about resources for help if they cannot stop drinking on their own.

**Healthcare providers can**

                      * Screen all adult patients for alcohol use at least yearly.
                      * Advise women not to drink at all if there is any chance they could be pregnant.
                      * Counsel, refer, and follow up with patients who need more help.
                      * Use the correct billing codes so that alcohol screening and counseling is reimbursable.
