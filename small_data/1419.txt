CDC's Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) is the only nationwide investment
that supports all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 8 U.S. territories, and
12 tribal organizations to protect kids and help smokers quit. This page
highlights some ways states are preventing and reducing tobacco use, while
leveraging OSH's expertise, resources, or technical assistance to maximize
their impact.

Alabama

Alabama protected more than 8,600 low-income Alabamans from secondhand smoke
exposure in their homes

Each year, about 41,000 Americans die from secondhand smoke exposure. The home
is the primary source of secondhand smoke exposure for children. Secondhand
smoke exposure causes ear infections, respiratory infections, more frequent
and severe asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome among children. Alabama's
tobacco prevention and control staff, who are supported with CDC funding, are
doing their part to protect Alabama residents in public housing from the risks
of secondhand smoke exposure in their homes.

Indiana

Indiana uses science-based strategy to change attitudes and lower exposure to
secondhand smoke

Tobacco use has declined in Indiana in recent years, and 22 cities and
counties have protected their residents from secondhand smoke by adopting
comprehensive smoke-free policies. However, a majority of Indiana residents
still are not covered by comprehensive smoke-free policies, encountering
secondhand smoke in public places and their workplaces. Indiana's tobacco
control program--supported by CDC funding--has put in place a number of
strategies to educate citizens and decision makers about the problem, reduce
secondhand smoke exposure, and support people who want to quit using tobacco.

Kentucky

Kentucky increased access to cessation medications and counseling to help
Kentuckians quit using tobacco products

Each year, tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure kills more than 8,800
Kentuckians and costs more than $1.2 billion in Medicaid and Medicare
treatment costs. Kentucky's tobacco control program, which is supported with
CDC funding, built strategic partnerships to help ensure that all Kentuckians
have access to counseling and FDA-approved medications to help them quit using
tobacco products.

Nebraska

Nebraska's toolkits and training helped 25 housing authorities implement
policies to protect residents from secondhand smoke exposure in their homes

In Nebraska, 2,500 adults die from smoking-related illnesses each year, and
nearly 18,000 children are exposed to secondhand smoke at home. People living
in multiunit housing are particularly susceptible to unwanted secondhand smoke
exposure, which can transfer between apartments. Nebraska's tobacco prevention
and control staff are supported with CDC funding. They prepared toolkits and
trained housing managers, and used CDC's scientific data, educational
resources, and media tools to reach public housing managers and residents.

New York

Six New York communities acted to bring down tobacco use by reducing the
number and types of stores selling tobacco and by raising tobacco prices

Despite significant reductions in tobacco use over the last 15 years, 28,200
New York state residents die from tobacco-related illnesses each year. New
York's tobacco control program understands the importance of using data to
motivate community partners and guide decision-making. The program--supported
with CDC funding--shared national, state, and local data with communities and
educated them about strategies known to reduce tobacco use.

West Virginia

Small rural pharmacy pilot program created by West Virginia tobacco control
staff and partners helped 36 people quit smoking

Cigarette smoking causes about 480,000 deaths every year. West Virginia has
the highest percentage of adult cigarette smokers in the United States. In
2016, the West Virginia Division of Tobacco Prevention, with funding and
technical support from CDC, created a pilot program for pharmacists in rural
counties to counsel people. This partnership helped people quit smoking.
