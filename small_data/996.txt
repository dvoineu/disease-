Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling and
complex illness. Scientists do not know what causes it, and there is no cure
or approved treatment for the illness. ME/CFS is often thought of as a problem
in adults, but children (both adolescents and younger children) can also get
ME/CFS.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Not as much is known about ME/CFS in children because there have been few studies in this age group.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Scientists estimate that up to 2 in 100 children suffer from ME/CFS.
