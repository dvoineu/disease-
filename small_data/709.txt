Six in ten Americans live with at least one chronic disease, like heart
disease and stroke, cancer, or diabetes. These and other chronic diseases are
the leading causes of death and disability in America, and they are also a
leading driver of health care costs.

At CDC, our job is to make it easier for all Americans to make healthy choices
so they can enjoy life. We know that most chronic diseases can be prevented by
eating well, being physically active, avoiding tobacco and excessive drinking,
and getting regular health screenings. CDC's National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) helps people and communities
prevent chronic diseases and promotes health and wellness for all.
