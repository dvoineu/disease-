Below is more detailed information on the methods used for HPV-IMPACT,
including our case definition, populations, data collection, and laboratory
testing.

### Case Definition

A case is defined as a resident in one of the surveillance areas who has a
histologically-confirmed diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
grades 2 or 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ (collectively referred to as CIN2+)
and is at least 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis. The date of
diagnosis must be on or after January 1, 2008.

### Case Identification

Cases are identified based on laboratory reports of CIN2+. Each laboratory in
the surveillance area regularly provides laboratory reports of CIN2+ findings
to the local site. Because classification for pre-invasive cervical neoplasia
is not standardized in the United States, a master list of possible diagnostic
codes, terminology, and search terms has been provided to all sites and
reporting laboratories to standardize case identification.

### Surveillance Populations

We conduct surveillance among 1,552,271 women age 18 and older, and conduct
enhanced surveillance among women aged 18-39 years.  The table below
illustrates the populations under surveillance for each area, as of January
2017.

HPV-IMPACT Survey results of women aged 18-39 years EIP site | Catchment area
location | Female population aged 18 years and older | Female population aged
18-39 years  
---|---|---|---  
CA** | 8 contiguous cities (Alameda County) | 317,735 | 114,492  
CT* | New Haven County | 352,983 | 105,995  
NY* | Monroe County | 302,606 | 91,386  
OR** | 28 zip codes in Portland Metro (portions of Washington, Multnomah
Counties) | 272,965 | 112,726  
TN* | Davidson County | 305,982 | 119,064  
Total | 1,552,271 | 543,663  
  
*Populations retrieved from the National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race vintage 2015 postcensal file  
**Populations were estimated from both the National Center for Health
Statistics bridged-race vintage 2015 postcensal file and the American
Community Survey's 2015 census file.

### Data Collection

For each case of CIN2+ identified among women aged 18 years or older, a case
report form with basic demographic and clinical data is completed. If the case
is between the ages of 18-39 years, an enhanced case report form is completed
and tissue specimen is collected and sent to CDC for HPV type testing.
Additional data collected on the enhanced case report form include race,
ethnicity, insurance, cervical cancer screening history, and vaccination
history. These data are abstracted through laboratory and medical records.

### Laboratory Methods

A portion of tissue that was originally used by a pathologist to diagnose the
case is sent to CDC for HPV DNA typing. A pathologist at CDC examines tissue
samples to make sure that a high-grade cervical lesion is present on the
tissue specimen that was sent.  DNA is extracted and tested for 37 HPV types
(6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58,
59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, 89, IS39).
