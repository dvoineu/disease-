1Case data after 1974 are not comparable to prior years due to changes in the
surveillance case definition that became effective in 1975.  
2The large decrease in death rate in 1979 occurred because late effects of
tuberculosis (e.g., bronchiectasis or fibrosis) and pleurisy with effusion
(without mention of cause) are no longer included in tuberculosis deaths.
Percent change in tuberculosis death rates is calculated with unrounded
figures. See Technical Notes.

**Note:** The 1993 to 2018 tuberculosis case counts and rates were updated
using the following sources: Bridged-Race 1990-1999 Intercensal Population
Estimates for 1990-1999, Intercensal Estimates of the Resident Population for
the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2000 to July 1,

United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 July 1,
2018external icon; accessed June 17, 2019.

Data for all years updated through June 6, 2019.
