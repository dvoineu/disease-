monitor long-term trends in public health. It is used to examine public health
issues across several years, to track the trends, compare health among groups
of people, and determine whether something is improving or worsening for a
specific group of people.

CDC is collaborating with researchers from the Food and Drug Administration to
conduct this nationwide longitudinal study which focuses on infant feeding
practices and the diets of women from their 3rd trimester to 12 months
postpartum.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Maternity Care Practices Survey (mPINC)  
CDC has developed a survey of all labor and delivery service facilities in the
United States in an effort to monitor maternity care practices associated with
successful breastfeeding promotion and support. This systematic data
collection of nationwide breastfeeding-related maternity care practices occurs
every other year; the first survey was carried out in 2007, the second in
2009.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * HealthStyles Survey  
Healthstyles is a private proprietary national marketing survey that annually
collects health-related opinions of men and women aged 18 years and above.
Because Healthstyles includes a large, demographically diverse sample of the
U.S. population, it reflects current social and cultural norms. CDC has
contributed breastfeeding questions to the survey since 1999.
