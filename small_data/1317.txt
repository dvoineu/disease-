From this program's data, more than 45 papers have been published providing important public health and clinical knowledge for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The program has expanded and now covers eight types of muscular dystrophy.

Since funding began in 2002, CDC and Special Olympics have worked with more than 200 partners to prevent injuries, illnesses, and premature deaths of people with IDs by improving equitable access to quality health care, education, and services.

As a result, vaccination recommendations for the pneumococcal vaccine are changed to include cochlear implant recipients as a population at high risk for bacterial meningitis.

These two core items, relating to activity limitation (due to physical, mental, or emotional problems) and use of special equipment (cane, wheelchair, bed, telephone), were added to the BRFSS to identify people with disabilities in all states using the survey.

These results led to improvements in the safety of hemophilia treatment products made from plasma.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * CDC creates the Thalassemia Data and Blood Specimen Collection Project to quickly find known and developing infections that might spread through blood transfusion and be a potential threat to high-risk thalassemia patients.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * NCBDDD concludes its investigation into the association between cochlear implants and bacterial meningitis among children, showing that a particular cochlear implant is associated with bacterial meningitis. The findings, which were published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ , were subsequently awarded the Charles C. Shepard Award.

This work led to swift action to develop guidance and recommendations for these vulnerable populations. NCBDDD also conducted important work on describing the increased rate of death among children with neurologic and neurodevelopmental disorders and the lack of flu vaccination uptake among families with children with these disabilities.

Entitled "Prevalence of Diagnosed Tourette Syndrome in Persons Aged 6-17 Years -- United States, 2007," this was the first published study to provide national prevalence data on TS, thus documenting the burden of TS.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The Children's Health Team is mobilized in May 2009 to respond to H1N1 (influenza A). NCBDDD's efforts during the flu pandemic highlighted the need to ensure that children are top-of-mind during a response, helped to identify an "at-risk" group of children, within the broader category of children, with special healthcare needs, and underscored the need for a team dedicated to pediatric issues during an emergency response. As a result, the Children's Preparedness Unit (CPU) was formed in 2012 to conduct research and promote efforts to ensure that children's issues are accounted for in future responses.
