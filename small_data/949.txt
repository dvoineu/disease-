Learn More About 2019-nCoV

MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, likely spreads from an infected person's
respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, we don't fully
understand the precise ways that it spreads.

MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as
caring for or living with an infected person. Infected people have spread
MERS-CoV to others in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. Researchers
studying MERS have not seen any ongoing spreading of MERS-CoV in the
community.

All reported cases have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian
Peninsula. Most infected people either lived in the Arabian Peninsula or
recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula before they became ill. A few
people have gotten MERS after having close contact with an infected person who
had recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak
of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in
2015 and was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.

Public health agencies continue to investigate clusters of cases in several
countries to better understand how MERS-CoV spreads from person to person.
