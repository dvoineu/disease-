The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides independent oversight
to the U.S. chemical weapons elimination program and serves as an important
element in ensuring the safe destruction of chemical warfare material for
protection of public health. The CDC program is part of the National Center
for Environmental Health's Division of Environmental Health Science and
Practice.

**CDC focuses on human health for both the worker and the community,
particularly related to potential exposure to chemical agents. For example,
