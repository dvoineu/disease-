**Note:** The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting healthcare seeking behavior. The
number of persons and their reasons for seeking care in the outpatient and ED
settings is changing. These changes impact data from ILINet in ways that are
difficult to differentiate from changes in illness levels, therefore ILINet
data should be interpreted with caution.

Key Updates for Week 13, ending March 28, 2020

 **Laboratory confirmed flu activity as reported by clinical laboratories
continues to decrease sharply and is now low. Influenza-like illness activity,
while lower than last week, is still elevated. Influenza severity indicators
remain moderate to low overall, but hospitalization rates differ by age group,
with high rates among children and young adults.**

#### Viruses

Clinical Labs

The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at
clinical laboratories decreased from 7.3% last week to 2.1% this week.

Public Health Labs

Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are now the most commonly reported
influenza viruses this season.

Virus Characterization

Genetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility of
influenza viruses collected in the U.S. are summarized in this report.

#### Illness

Outpatient Illness: ILINet

Visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI) decreased
from 6.3% last week to 5.4% this week. All regions are above their baselines.

Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map

![Flu Activity & Surveillance](/flu/images/weekly/week-13.jpg)

The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity decreased from 37
last week to 31 this week.

Geographic Spread

![Spread Map 13](/flu/images/weekly/spread-map-13.jpg)

The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread influenza
activity decreased from 49 last week to 41 this week.

#### Severe Disease

Hospitalizations

The overall cumulative hospitalization rate for the season increased to 67.9
per 100,000.

P&I Mortality

The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza is 8.2%, above
the epidemic threshold of 7.2%.

Pediatric Deaths

7 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season
were reported this week. The total for the season is 162.

_All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received._

_A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology
and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the
_surveillance methods_ page._

_Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each
surveillance component are available on _FluView Interactive_._

While influenza B/Victoria viruses predominated earlier in the season, during
recent weeks, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported more
frequently than B/Victoria viruses nationally and in all surveillance regions.
For the season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the predominant virus nationally.
Regional and state level data about circulating influenza viruses can be found
on FluView Interactive.

The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season
overall, influenza B viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses
among persons 5-24 years, while influenza A viruses are the most commonly
reported influenza viruses among persons 0-4 years and 25 years and older. In
the most recent three weeks, influenza A viruses are the most commonly
reported influenza viruses in all age groups.

## Influenza Virus Characterization

CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted
from state and local health laboratories using Right Size Roadmap submission
guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating
influenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new
influenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur
in circulating influenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on
an animal model (influenza-naive ferrets), and do not reflect pre-existing
protection provided by past influenza infections and vaccinations. Additional
antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current
influenza vaccines are conducted later in the season; these data account for
pre-existing protection in different populations against circulating influenza
viruses. Genetic and antigenic characterization data are not used to make
calculations about vaccine effectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each
year to measure the benefits of flu vaccines in people. Interim estimates of
2019-2020 flu vaccine effectiveness have been released.

CDC **genetically characterized** 2,350 influenza viruses collected in the
U.S. from September 29, 2019, to March 28, 2020.

CDC **antigenically characterizes** a subset of influenza viruses by
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralization based Focus Reduction
assays (FRA). Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing antigenic properties
of cell-propagated reference viruses representing currently recommended
vaccine components with those of cell-propagated circulating viruses. CDC
antigenically characterized 521 influenza viruses collected in the United
States from September 29, 2019, to March 28, 2020. These data are not used to
make calculations about vaccine effectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies
each year to measure the benefits of flu vaccines in people.

The decrease in the percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses similar to A/Brisbane/02/2018 is due to some of the recent viruses selected for testing having a single amino acid change that is antigenically distinguishable in antigenic assays using ferret sera. Similar viruses were observed last season as well and these represented a small proportion of virus circulating. We have observed an increase in the proportion of H1N1pdm09 viruses with this change late in the US season.

CDC also assesses **susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral
medications** including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir,
and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next
generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Viruses
collected in the United States since September 29, 2019, were tested for
antiviral susceptibility as follows:

Antiviral Medication | **Total Viruses*** | **A/H1** | **A/H3** |

*Six influenza viruses showed reduced or highly reduced inhibition by at least one neuraminidase inhibitor. Four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir while showing normal inhibition to zanamivir. In addition, one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition to peramivir and reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and zanamivir, while another influenza B/Victoria virus showed reduced inhibition to zanamivir.

  

A total of 556 additional viruses (211 A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 A(H3N2), and 313 B)
collected in Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South
Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin were analyzed for resistance to neuraminidase
inhibitors by pyrosequencing assay. Three (1.4%) of the 211 A(H1N1)pdm09
viruses tested had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and
showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. No molecular
markers associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by neuraminidase
inhibitors were detected in A(H3N2) and type B viruses tested.

  
  

## Outpatient Illness Surveillance

### ILINet

Nationwide during week 13, 5.4% of patient visits reported through the U.S.
Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to
influenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is above the national baseline
of 2.4%.

View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen  

On a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from
3.7% to 12.2% during week 13. Only region 2 reported an increase in percentage
of outpatient visits for ILI, but all regions reported a percentage of
outpatient visits for ILI above their region-specific baselines.

### ILI Activity Map

Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by
state.

During week 13, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:

*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete.

Among the 31 jurisdictions with high ILI activity, ILI increased relative to
the previous week in one, remained stable in 30 and declined in 27. Twenty-
seven of the jurisdictions with high ILI activity also had clinical laboratory
data available and in those, the percent of specimens testing positive for
influenza decreased in all but one.

##  Geographic Spread of Influenza as Assessed by State and Territorial
Epidemiologists

The influenza activity reported by state and territorial epidemiologists
indicates geographic spread of influenza viruses but does not measure the
severity of influenza activity.

During week 13, the following influenza activity was reported:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Widespread â Puerto Rico and 22 states (Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin)

## Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations

The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts
population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related
hospitalizations in select counties in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP)
states and Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states.

A total of 19,713 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations
were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020;
14,244 (72.3%) were associated with influenza A virus, 5,357 (27.2%) with
influenza B virus, 59 (0.3%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-
infection, and 53 (0.3%) with influenza virus for which the type was not
determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 3,771 (94.4%)
were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 221 (5.5%) were A(H3N2).

The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 67.9 per 100,000 population,
which is higher than all recent seasons at this time of year except for the
2017-18 season. Rates in children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old are
now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing the rate
reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged
children are higher than any recent regular season but lower than rates during
the pandemic.

The highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged â¥ 65, followed by
children aged 0-4 years and adults aged 50-64 years.

**Age Group** | **2019-2020 Season  
Cumulative Rate per 100,000 Population**  
---|---  
Overall | 67.9  
0-4 years |  93.9  
5-17 years | 24.6  
18-49 years | 35.5  
50-64 years |  89.7  
65+ years | 178.8  
  

Among 3,271 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical
conditions, 92.1% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the
most commonly reported were cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder,
obesity, and chronic lung disease. Among 552 hospitalized children with
information on underlying medical conditions, 48.4% had at least one
underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma. Among 556
hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-44 years) with information on
pregnancy status, 27.2% were pregnant.

## Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) Mortality Surveillance

Based on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance
data available on March 26, 2020, 8.2% of the deaths occurring during the week
ending March 21, 2020 (week 12) were due to P&I.; This percentage is above the
epidemic threshold of 7.2% for week 12.

![INFLUENZA Virus
Isolated](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/images/NCHS13_small.gif)  
View Chart Data | View Full Screen  

While the percent of all deaths due to P&I; has increased during weeks 9-12
(7.4-8.2%), the percent of all deaths with Influenza listed as a cause have
decreased (from 1.0% to 0.8%) over this same time period. The increase in
pneumonia deaths during this time period are likely associated with COVID-19
rather than influenza.

## Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality

Seven influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020
season between weeks 5 and 13 (the weeks ending February 1, 2020 and March 28,
2020) were reported to CDC during week 13. Four were associated with influenza
A viruses, and all were subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Three were
associated with influenza B viruses, and one was subtyped as a B/Victoria
virus.
