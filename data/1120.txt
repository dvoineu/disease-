The following action steps have been proposed by CDC for consideration by
state and local education and health agencies to address health and
educational disparities among students.

Focus Programmatic Efforts

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Analyze data to identify which groups of youth are at high risk for targeted problems or risk behaviors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Target efforts and resources to support policy and programmatic efforts that address the needs of youth in high-risk groups
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Support the design and implementation of evidence-based, culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions and programs that focus on youth at high risk

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Educate policy makers, the public, and other agencies and organizations about health and educational disparities, their causes, and evidence-based strategies for effectively addressing specific issues among specific groups of youth at high risk

Build Partnerships

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Actively involve youth at high risk in advisory boards or youth councils that plan programs to address health and educational disparities
