# Oral hypoglycemics overdose

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Oral hypoglycemic pills are medicines to control diabetes. Oral means "taken
by mouth." There are many different types of oral hypoglycemics. This article
focuses on a type called sulfonylureas.

An overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended
amount of this medicine. The result is a drop in blood sugar level that
affects normal function of the body's organs. An overdose may occur by
accident or on purpose.

This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an
actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local
emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached
directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline
(1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

## Poisonous Ingredient

There are many types of oral hypoglycemics. The poisonous ingredient depends
on the specific drug. The main ingredient in sulfonylurea-based oral
hypoglycemics makes cells in the pancreas produce more insulin.

## Where Found

Sulfonylurea-based oral hypoglycemics can be found in these medicines:

    * Chlorpropamide
    * Glipizide
    * Glyburide
    * Glimepiride
    * Tolbutamide
    * Tolazamide

Other medicines may also contain sulfonylurea-based oral hypoglycemics.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of an overdose of this medicine include:

    * Agitation, nervousness, tremor
    * Apathy (lack of desire to do anything)
    * Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness)
    * Confusion
    * Convulsions (seizures, especially in infants and children)
    * Increased appetite
    * Nausea
    * Rapid heartbeat
    * Stupor (decreased level of consciousness plus confusion)
    * Sweating
    * Tingling of tongue and lips 

People who have had a stroke in the past may appear to be having another
stroke if their blood sugar drops too low.

## Before Calling Emergency

Have this information ready:

    * Person's age, weight, and condition
    * Name of the medicine (and strength, if known)
    * Time it was swallowed
    * Amount swallowed

## Poison Control

Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the
national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1800-222-1222) from anywhere in the
United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in
poisoning. They will give you further instructions.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in
the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any
questions about poisoning or poison control. It does NOT need to be an
emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the medicine container to hospital with you, if possible.

The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs,
including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.

Tests that may be done include:

    * Blood and urine tests
    * Chest x-ray
    * ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)

Treatment may include:

    * Intravenous fluids (given through a vein)
    * Medicine to treat symptoms
    * Activated charcoal
    * Laxatives
    * Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Some of oral hypoglycemicsÂ may stay in the body for a long time, so theÂ
person may need to stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days. Permanent brain
damage and death are possible, especially if blood glucose level does not
return to normal in a timely manner. Infants, children, and older people are
most likely to develop more serious and long-term complications from low blood
sugar levels that are not corrected rapidly.

## Alternative Names

Diabetes pill overdose; Sulfonylurea overdose
