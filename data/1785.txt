## Summary

Methamphetamine - meth for short - is a very addictive stimulant drug. It is a
powder that can be made into a pill or a shiny rock (called a crystal). The
powder can be eaten or snorted up the nose. It can also be mixed with liquid
and injected into your body with a needle. Crystal meth is smoked in a small
glass pipe.

Meth at first causes a rush of good feelings, but then users feel edgy, overly
excited, angry, or afraid. Meth use can quickly lead to addiction. It causes
medical problems including

    * Making your body temperature so high that you pass out
    * Severe itching
    * "Meth mouth" - broken teeth and dry mouth
    * Thinking and emotional problems
