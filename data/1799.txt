## Summary

Myositis means inflammation of the muscles that you use to move your body. An
injury, infection, or autoimmune disease can cause it. Two specific kinds are
polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Polymyositis causes muscle weakness, usually
in the muscles closest to the trunk of your body. Dermatomyositis causes
muscle weakness, plus a skin rash.

Other symptoms of myositis may include

    * Fatigue after walking or standing
    * Tripping or falling
    * Trouble swallowing or breathing

Doctors may use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests and a muscle biopsy
to diagnose myositis. There is no cure for these diseases, but you can treat
the symptoms. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high
doses of a corticosteroid. Other options include medications, physical
therapy, exercise, heat therapy, assistive devices, and rest.
