### CDC Works With Global Partners to End Cholera

Cholera, caused by the bacteria _Vibrio cholerae_ , is rare in the United
States and other industrialized nations. However, globally, cholera cases have
increased steadily since 2005 and the disease still occurs in many places
including Africa, Southeast Asia, and Haiti. CDC responds to cholera outbreaks
across the world using its Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
expertise.

Cholera can be life-threatening but it is easily prevented and treated.
Travelers, public health and medical professionals and outbreak responders
should be aware of areas with high rates of cholera, know how the disease
spreads, and what to do to prevent it.
