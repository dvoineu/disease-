![Global Tobacco Surveillance System](/tobacco/global/gtss/images/gtss.jpg)

The Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS) aims to enhance country capacity
to design, implement, and evaluate tobacco control interventions, and monitor
key articles of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (FCTC) and components of the WHO MPOWER technical package.

GTSS includes the collection of data through four surveys: the Global Youth
Tobacco Survey (GYTS); Global School Personnel Survey (GSPS); Global Health
Professions Student Survey (GHPSS) and Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS).
GYTS focuses on youth aged 13-15 and collects information in schools. GSPS
surveys teachers and administrators from the same schools that participate in
the GYTS. GHPSS focuses on 3rd year students pursuing degrees in dentistry,
medicine, nursing and pharmacy. GATS is a nationally representative household
survey that monitors tobacco use among adults aged 15 years and older.

### GTSSData

The Global Tobacco Surveillance System Data (GTSSData) is a Web-based
application that houses and displays data from four tobacco-related surveys
conducted around the world.
