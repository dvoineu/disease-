Regardless of your child's age, he or she may feel upset or have other strong
emotions after an emergency. Some children react right away, while others may
show signs of difficulty much later. How children react or common signs of
distress can vary according to age. Knowing how to help children cope after an
emergency can help them stay healthy in future emergencies.

An emergency can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important for parents
to know what steps they can take before, during, and after an emergency to
protect their family. Parents ensure that family members are ready and know
what to do when emergencies happen.

### Before an Emergency

**A little preparation now can make a big difference later.**

Here are some steps you can take to help keep your family safe and healthy
when an emergency happens:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Prepare an emergency kit that includes a 3-day supply of necessities for each person in your family, such as food, medicine, water, games, flashlight, and special toys to help keep your children calm during an emergency.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Make a plan to contact family members, especially if you are not together when an emergency strikes. If your children are old enough, teach them how to call 911 and memorize important phone numbers. Create a reunification plan as part of the family communication plan to reunite  you with your loved ones as soon as it is safe to do so.

For example, if tornadoes are common, your children should know what to do during a tornado. This includes knowing the signs of an approaching storm and instructions on how to take shelter during a tornado.

Getting your children to help with preparing for an emergency can teach them
the basics of staying safe and will make emergencies less stressful because
they will be prepared and empowered. Ask them what items they think should go
in an emergency kit and plan.

**Help protect your child during the school day.**

In the United States, about 69 million children are separated from their
parents or caregivers every work day to attend school or child care. You can
help protect your children, even when you are not with them, through the
following steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Find out the school or childcare center 's emergency plans**. Every school and childcare center should have a written emergency plan with information, such as how to contact parents in an emergency and where children will go if evacuated. Also, ask how you can contact the school or childcare center during an emergency and how parents and caregivers will reunite with their children.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Update your emergency contact information**. Make sure that the school has up-to-date emergency contact information for your child. Notify the school every time your address or phone number changes. Keeping a backpack emergency card with your child is one way to make sure that emergency contact information - as well as other important information like medications and allergies - is handy.

### During an Emergency

**Different emergencies may require different actions. Protect your family by
knowing what to do.**

Each emergency is different and may require different actions to keep you and
your family safe. Local authorities will share safety instructions and updates
on television, radio, the Internet, or social media pages, like Twitter and
Facebook. Depending on the emergency, authorities may ask you to stay where
you are ("shelter in place"), or they may recommend that you go somewhere else
("evacuate").  
If you have children in a school in the exposed area, school authorities may
evacuate your children to a safer place or emergency shelter. In these cases,
do not go to your children during the emergency. This can put you and your
children at greater risk. Wait until emergency or school authorities say it is
safe for you to pick up your children.

##### Reuniting After an Emergency

Children may be away from their parents - or accidentally separated- during an
emergency. Having a reunification plan and knowing reunification resources can
help you reunite with your loved ones as soon as it is safe to do so.

##### Helping Children Cope

Regardless of your child's age, he or she may feel upset or have other strong
emotions after an emergency. Some children react right away, while others may
show signs of difficulty much later. How children react or common signs of
distress can vary according to age. Knowing how to help children cope after an
emergency can help them stay healthy in future emergencies.
