There are four types of influenza viruses:  A, B, C and D. Wild aquatic birds
- particularly certain wild ducks, geese, swans, gulls, shorebirds and terns -
are the natural hosts for most influenza type A viruses.

### Subtypes of Influenza A Viruses

Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes on the basis of two proteins on
the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)image icon.
There are 18 known HA subtypes and 11 known NA subtypes. Many different
combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible. For example, an "H7N2 virus"
designates an influenza A virus subtype that has an HA 7 protein and an NA 2
protein. Similarly, an "H5N1" virus has an HA 5 protein and an NA 1 protein.

All known subtypes of influenza A viruses can infect birds, except subtypes
H17N10 and H18N11, which have only been found in bats. Only two influenza A
virus subtypes (i.e., H1N1, and H3N2) are currently in general circulation
among people. Some subtypes are found in other infected animal species. For
example, H7N7 and H3N8 virus infections can cause illness in horses, and H3N8
virus infection cause illness in horses and dogs.

### Lineages of Influenza A Viruses

Avian influenza (AI) viruses - influenza viruses which infect birds -have
evolved into distinct genetic lineages in different geographic locations.
These different lineages can be distinguished by studying the genetic make-up
of these viruses. For example, AI viruses circulating in birds in Asia, called
Asian lineage AI viruses, can be recognized as genetically different from AI
viruses that circulate among birds in North America (called North American
lineage AI viruses). These broad lineage classifications can be further
narrowed by genetic comparisons that allow researchers to group the most
closely related viruses together. Thus, the North American lineage of H7N9
viruses could be further broken down into the North American 'wild bird'
lineage versus the North American 'poultry' lineage. The host, time period and
geographical location are often used in the lineage name to help further
delineate one lineage from another.

### Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza A Viruses

Avian influenza A viruses are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) or low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on molecular
characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and
mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting. HPAI and LPAI designations do
not refer to the severity of illness in cases of human infection with these
viruses; both LPAI and HPAI viruses have caused severe illness in humans

Poultry infected with LPAI viruses may show no signs of disease or only
exhibit mild illness (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production)
which may not be detected. Infection of poultry with HPAI viruses can cause
severe disease with high mortality. Both HPAI and LPAI viruses can spread
rapidly through poultry flocks. HPAI virus infection can cause disease that
affects multiple internal organs with mortality up to 90% to100% in chickens,
often within 48 hours. However, ducks can be infected without any signs of
illness. There are genetic and antigenic differences between the influenza A
virus subtypes that typically infect only birds and those that can infect
birds and people.

Avian influenza viruses rarely infect people. The most frequently identified
subtypes of avian influenza that have caused human infections are H5, H7 and
H9 viruses. Other viruses, such as H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8, have been detected
in people also, but to a lesser extent.

#### Influenza A H5

There are nine known subtypes of H5 virusesexternal icon (H5N1, H5N2, H5N3,
H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, H5N7, H5N8, and H5N9). Most H5 viruses identified worldwide
in wild birds and poultry are LPAI, but occasionally HPAI viruses have been
detected. Sporadic H5 virus infection of humans has occurred, such as with
Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 viruses currently circulating among poultry in Asia
and the Middle East. Human infection of H5N1 virus infections have been
reported in 16 countries, often resulting in severe pneumonia and greater than
50% mortality.

#### Influenza A H7

There are nine known subtypes of H7 virusesexternal icon (H7N1, H7N2, H7N3,
H7N4, H7N5, H7N6, H7N7, H7N8, and H7N9). Most H7 viruses identified worldwide
in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H7 virus infection in humans is
uncommon. The most frequently identified H7 viruses associated with human
infection are Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, which were first
detected in China in 2013. While human infections are rare, these have
commonly resulted in severe respiratory illness and death. In addition to
Asian lineage H7N9 viruses, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7 virus infections have been
reported. These viruses have primarily caused mild to moderate illness in
people, with symptoms that include conjunctivitis and/or upper respiratory
tract symptoms.

#### Influenza A H9

There are nine known subtypes of H9 virusesexternal icon (H9N1, H9N2, H9N3,
H9N4, H9N5, H9N6, H9N7, H9N8, and H9N9); all H9 viruses identified worldwide
in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H9N2 virus has been detected in
bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Rare, sporadic
H9N2 virus infections in people have been reported to generally cause mild
upper respiratory tract illness; one infection has results in death.
