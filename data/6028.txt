![How can I avoid getting gonorrhea? Learn
More](/std/images/cta_gonorrhea_1.jpg)

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can infect both men and
women. It can cause infections in the genitals, rectum, and throat. It is a
very common infection, especially among young people ages 15-24 years.

### How is gonorrhea spread?

You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who
has gonorrhea. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can give the infection to her
baby during childbirth.

### How can I reduce my risk of getting gonorrhea?

The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.

If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your
chances of getting gonorrhea:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results;

### Am I at risk for gonorrhea?

Any sexually active person can get gonorrhea through unprotected vaginal,
anal, or oral sex.

If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your health care
provider and ask whether you should be tested for gonorrhea or other STDs. If
you are a sexually active man who is gay, bisexual, or who has sex with men,
you should be tested for gonorrhea every year. If you are a sexually active
woman younger than 25 years or an older woman with risk factors such as new or
multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted
infection, you should be tested for gonorrhea every year.

### I'm pregnant. How does gonorrhea affect my baby?

If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can give the infection to your
baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If
you are pregnant, it is important that you talk to your health care provider
so that you get the correct examination, testing, and treatment, as necessary.
Treating gonorrhea as soon as possible will make health complications for your
baby less likely.

### How do I know if I have gonorrhea?

Some men with gonorrhea may have no symptoms at all. However, men who do have
symptoms, may have:

![I was just diagnosed. What do I do
now?](/std/prevention/images/justDiagnosedButton.png)

You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or
if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD, such as an unusual sore, a
smelly discharge, burning when urinating, or bleeding between periods.

### How will my doctor know if I have gonorrhea?

Most of the time, urine can be used to test for gonorrhea. However, if you
have had oral and/or anal sex, swabs may be used to collect samples from your
throat and/or rectum. In some cases, a swab may be used to collect a sample
from a man's urethra (urine canal) or a woman's cervix (opening to the womb).

### Can gonorrhea be cured?

Yes, gonorrhea can be cured with the right treatment. It is important that you
take all of the medication your doctor prescribes to cure your infection.
Medication for gonorrhea should not be shared with anyone. Although medication
will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the
disease.

![Antibiotic-Resistant Gonorrhea](/std/images/promos/arg180.png)

It is becoming harder to treat some gonorrhea, as drug-resistant strains of
gonorrhea are increasing. If your symptoms continue for more than a few days
after receiving treatment, you should return to a health care provider to be
checked again.

### I was treated for gonorrhea. When can I have sex again?

You should wait seven days after finishing all medications before having sex.
To avoid getting infected with gonorrhea again or spreading gonorrhea to your
partner(s), you and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have
each completed treatment. If you've had gonorrhea and took medicine in the
past, you can still get infected again if you have unprotected sex with a
person who has gonorrhea.

### What happens if I don't get treated?

Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems in both
women and men.  
In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Some of the complications of PID are

In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the
testicles. In rare cases, this may cause a man to be sterile, or prevent him
from being able to father a child.  
Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or joints. This
condition can be life-threatening.

Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV -
the virus that causes AIDS.
