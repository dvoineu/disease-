### Many Public Housing Authorities Use Nebraska Health Department Expertise
To Implement Federal Smoke-Free Housing Policy

Like the rich plains and prairies throughout the state, many good things come
from the hard work of the Tobacco Free Nebraska team from the Nebraska
Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Public Health. The state
prohibited smoking in indoor workplaces and public places in 2009, yet 2,500
Nebraskan adults still die from smoking-related illnesses each year.1 Troubled
by this and the knowledge that nearly 18,000 Nebraskan children are exposed to
secondhand smoke at home,2 the Tobacco Free Nebraska team thought of ways to
protect more people from secondhand smoke.

### Making It Easier for Housing Managers to Provide Smoke-Free Homes

People living in multiunit housing, such as apartments, are particularly
susceptible to unwanted secondhand smoke exposure in the home. Secondhand
smoke can travel between units in apartment buildings through doorways and in
other ways, such as through electrical lines, ventilation systems, and
plumbing. Secondhand smoke is not safe at any level.3

Many residents in public housing are children, older adults, and people with
disabilities.4 Nebraska's Public Housing Authorities, which provide
government-subsidized housing, were early leaders in the United States for
adopting smoke-free housing policies. However, the pace of adopting new smoke-
free housing policies in Nebraska's Public Housing Authorities had slowed. In
response, Tobacco Free Nebraska created a program to make implementation
easier for the housing authorities. The team also developed a toolkit that
included:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A guide explaining how to adopt smoke-free public housing policies.

Tobacco Free Nebraska gave these toolkits to any housing manager that filled
out a needs assessment in September 2016. The needs assessments helped Tobacco
Free Nebraska identify what other help housing managers need.

### Updating Resources to Reflect Changing Conditions and to Achieve a Broader
Reach

In December 2016, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
announced a new federal rule requiring public housing to be smoke-free by July
31, 2018. In August 2017, Tobacco Free Nebraska mailed new toolkits to each
housing authority within the state to help achieve this requirement. In
addition, Tobacco Free Nebraska brought in experts to train housing managers
in September 2017. Because of this timely and useful support, housing managers
continue to look to Tobacco Free Nebraska for training and tools to help adopt
and implement smoke-free policies.

Tobacco Free Nebraska continues to find new ways to help housing authorities
adopt HUD's smoke-free rule, such as:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Renting 20 billboards with messages from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) _Tips from Former Smokers_ ® ( _Tips_ ®) Campaign. These billboards were placed in communities that have high smoking rates and few smoke-free public housing policies.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Sending _Tips_ ® Campaign posters and other information about how to quit smoking to housing managers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Providing web-based training to housing managers about the smoke-free housing rule.

The implementation of Tobacco Free Nebraska's toolkits has already made an
impact. In 2017, 10 housing authorities in Nebraska adopted, and 5 housing
authorities began planning to adopt, new policies that meet the HUD
requirements. That same year, 10 Public Housing Authorities in Nebraska took
steps to update their existing smoke-free policies to better protect
residents. In addition to protecting people from secondhand smoke, these
smoke-free housing policies could help motivate others to quit. This work was
done with funding from CDC. In addition, CDC's scientific data, _Tips_ ®
Campaign, and other CDC Media Campaign Resource Center tools were key to
Tobacco Free Nebraska's success.
