## Summary

Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body
fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, the
bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the
healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work.

There are different types of leukemia, including

    * Acute lymphocytic leukemia
    * Acute myeloid leukemia
    * Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
    * Chronic myeloid leukemia

Leukemia can develop quickly or slowly. Chronic leukemia grows slowly. In
acute leukemia, the cells are very abnormal and their number increases
rapidly. Adults can get either type; children with leukemia most often have an
acute type. Some leukemias can often be cured. Other types are hard to cure,
but you can often control them. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation
and stem cell transplantation. Even if symptoms disappear, you might need
therapy to prevent a relapse.
