# Rationale and Considerations for Chlorine Use in Infection Control for Non-
U.S. General Healthcare Settings

Environmental cleaning is only one of several recommended methods to reduce
transmission of deadly germs among patients and healthcarepersonnel. Cleaning
and disinfection, along with other infection control measures like hand
hygiene and isolation precautions, are important ways to help stop the spread
of Ebola virus. 1-8  This guidance primarily aims to address infection
prevention and control practices in areas where chlorine solutions are
primarily used for disinfection and antisepsis, but are not standardized and
can vary widely in concentration and source.

## Description of Chlorine Use as a Disinfectant

**Rationale for use**

Chlorine solutions (Cl2, NaOCL, Ca[OCl]2, ClO) have been used extensively as
disinfectants and antiseptics since the 1800s11. Guidance documents on use of
these compounds for environmental and healthcare infection control in the
context of the Ebola preparedness and response in the United States have
recently been published9. Chlorine solutions are oxidative chemicals and have
broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of microorganisms, from viruses
to protozoa11-31.

During Ebola responses, chlorine solutions of 0.5% (in the United States, this
would generally be equivalent to a 1:10 dilution of household bleach) have
been used for environmental surface disinfection, while a 0.05% solution has
been used for hand hygiene. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have
typically provided hospitals and safe water programs with sodium
dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), an EPA-approved pool chemical in the United
States, for use in preparing disinfectant solutions as well as other chlorine-
based products for disinfection use. There have also been some projects in
Africa that have involved creating sodium hypochlorite electrolytically from
brine solutions (primarily to disinfect drinking water, for example, CDC Safe
Water, UNICEF Safe Waterexternal icon).

Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) solutions are produced in different
concentrations in different parts of the world, and solution strength can vary
between 2% and 12% NaOCl. (In comparison, most U.S. bleach products are
currently 6%-6.15%, but can range from 2.5%-8.25%, depending on their intended
use). Since there is such a wide variation in the strength of products
available in some countries, it is strongly recommend that concentration of
the chlorine product be evaluated prior to use.

## Validation of chlorine products

When in doubt about a product, it is recommended that the chlorine
concentration be determined using chemical analysis (for example, DPD
[N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine] color-change test kits, amperometric
titration for chlorine residuals, commercially available test strips, or dip
sticks). Reagent-grade water will also be needed to make 1:100 and 1:1000
dilutions of the prepared solution in order to conduct the testing.

However, chlorine solutions are known to be effective against a broad range of viruses11-31.

Wet contact times for chlorine range from 2 minutes to 10 minutes depending on the microbe/virus. For wet contact times more than 10 minutes, chlorine solution or other acceptable disinfectant may have to be reapplied. When treating surfaces that are potentially contaminated with Ebola virus and other bloodborne pathogens, allow a wet contact time of 10 minutes with a chlorine solution of 0.5% to 0.6%.

Both WHO and CDC recommend cleaning with detergent and water before applying disinfectant. This will help prevent inactivation of the disinfectant by organic matter8, 17, 32-34.

Soap and water or alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred (see WHO Guideline on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, 2009 pdf icon[PDF - 270 pages]external icon and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee's Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings, 2002). Alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) offer benefits when compared with using soap and water in skin tolerance, compliance, and, especially when combined with glove use, overall effectiveness for a wide variety of healthcare pathogens. However, if hands become visibly soiled, use soap and water, not alcohol-based hand rubs3, 4.

To be effective, a solution with concentration that contains either 0.5%-0.6% (5000-6000 ppm) or 0.05-0.06% (500-600 ppm) of available chlorine, depending on its intended use, is required for infection control. Household bleach, which in the United States would be considered NaOCl (Pure bright, Clorox bleach, Clorox germicidal bleach, Ultra Clorox germicidal bleach, CCCP), is different from either Ca(OCl)2 (for example, HTH, chlorinated lime) or the locally prepared "bleach" products that are commonly found in some countries. Understanding which product is being used to make a solution is very important, as the amount of dilution needed for a product to be effective will vary.
