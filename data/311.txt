## Summary

Child abuse is doing something or failing to do something that results in harm
to a child or puts a child at risk of harm. Child abuse can be physical,
sexual or emotional. Neglect, or not providing for a child's needs, is also a
form of abuse.

Most abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. An abused
child may become depressed. He or she may withdraw, think of suicide or become
violent. An older child may use drugs or alcohol, try to run away or abuse
others.

Child abuse is a serious problem. If you suspect a child is being abused or
neglected, call the police or your local child welfare agency.
