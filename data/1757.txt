## Summary

Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a
woman's monthly cycle. Every month, your body prepares for pregnancy. If no
pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood
is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. It passes out of the
body through the vagina.

Periods usually start between age 11 and 14 and continue until menopause at
about age 51. They usually last from three to five days. Besides bleeding from
the vagina, you may have

    * Abdominal or pelvic cramping pain
    * Lower back pain
    * Bloating and sore breasts
    * Food cravings
    * Mood swings and irritability
    * Headache and fatigue

Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a group of symptoms that start before the
period. It can include emotional and physical symptoms.

Consult your health care provider if you have big changes in your cycle. They
may be signs of other problems that should be treated.
