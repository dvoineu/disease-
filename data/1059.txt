![doctor and patient](/STD/images/150/doctor-patient-3.jpg)If you are sexually
active, getting tested for STDs is one of the most important things you can do
to protect your health. Make sure you have an open and honest conversation
about your sexual history and STD testing with your doctor and ask whether you
should be tested for STDs. If you are not comfortable talking with your
regular health care provider about STDs, there are many clinics that provide
confidential and free or low-cost testing.

Below is a brief overview of STD testing recommendations. STD screening
information for healthcare providers can be found here.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **All adults and adolescents from ages 13 to 64** should be tested at least once for HIV.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **All sexually active women** younger than 25 years should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia every year. Women 25 years and older with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STD should also be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia every year.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **All pregnant women** should be tested for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B starting early in pregnancy. At-risk pregnant women should also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea starting early in pregnancy. Testing should be repeated as needed to protect the health of mothers and their infants.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **All sexually active gay and bisexual men** should be tested at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Those who have multiple or anonymous partners should be tested more frequently for STDs (i.e., at 3- to 6-month intervals).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Sexually active gay and bisexual men** may benefit from more frequent HIV testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Anyone who has unsafe sex or shares injection drug equipment** should get tested for HIV at least once a year.
