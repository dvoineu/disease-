# Coal worker's pneumoconiosis

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a lung disease that results from
breathing in dust from coal, graphite, or man-made carbon over a long time.

CWP is also known as black lung disease.

## Causes

CWP occurs in two forms: simple and complicated (also called progressive
massive fibrosis, or PMF).

Your risk for developing CWP depends on how long you have been around coal
dust. Most people with this disease are older than 50. Smoking does not
increase your risk for developing this disease, but it may have an added
harmful effect on the lungs.

If CWP occurs with rheumatoid arthritis, it is called Caplan syndrome.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of CWP include:

    * Cough 
    * Shortness of breath
    * Coughing up of black sputum

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about
your symptoms.

Tests that may be done include:

    * Chest x-ray
    * Chest CT scan
    * Lung function tests

## Treatment

Â

Treatment may include any of the following, depending on how severe your
symptoms are:

    * Medicines to keep the airways open and reduce mucus
    * Pulmonary rehabilitation to help you learn ways to breathe better
    * Oxygen therapy
You should also avoid further exposure to coal dust.

## Support Groups

Ask your provider about Black Lung Clinics in your area. Information can be
found at the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics
website: blacklungcoalition.org/clinics.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome for the simple form is usually good. It rarely causes disability or
death. The complicated form may cause shortness of breath that worsens over
time.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Chronic bronchitis
    * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
    * Cor pulmonale (failure of the right side of the heart)
    * Respiratory failure

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath,
fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have
the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the
infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from
becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.

## Prevention

Wear a protective mask when working around coal, graphite, or man-made carbon.
Companies should enforce the maximum permitted dust levels. Avoid smoking.

## Alternative Names

Black lung disease; Pneumoconiosis; Anthrosilicosis
