# Anxiety and Depression Medicine Use Among Cancer Survivors

**Cancer survivors in the United States take medicine for anxiety or
depression at about twice the rate of people without a history of cancer.**

Many people who are diagnosed with cancer have feelings of sadness, fear,
anxiety, and depression. These feelings can be caused by fear of suffering or
death, changes in social roles, the pain caused by cancer or its treatments,
or a personal history of depression or anxiety. If left untreated for a long
time, anxiety and depression can lower cancer survivors' quality of life.

CDC scientists used responses to the National Health Interview Survey for the
years 2010 to 2013 to see the percentage of people who said they take medicine
for anxiety or depression. The scientists compared the percentage of cancer
survivors in this group to the percentage of people who never had cancer.

## Key Findings

In the United States, between 2010 and 2013--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * About 17% of cancer survivors took medicine for anxiety, 14% took medicine for depression, and 19% took medicine for both.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * About 9% of people who never had cancer took medicine for anxiety, 8% took medicine for depression, and 10% took medicine for both.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Cancer survivors who were widowed, divorced, or separated were more likely to take medicine for depression.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * It is important to note that information about when survivors began medication is not available. Also, it is not possible to conclude that the medication use was because of the cancer diagnosis, or whether those who reported medication use were formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression.
