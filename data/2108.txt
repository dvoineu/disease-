## Summary

A collapsed lung happens when air enters the pleural space, the area between
the lung and the chest wall. If it is a total collapse, it is called
pneumothorax. If only part of the lung is affected, it is called atelectasis.

Causes of a collapsed lung include

    * Lung diseases such as pneumonia or lung cancer
    * Being on a breathing machine
    * Surgery on the chest or abdomen
    * A blocked airway

If only a small area of the lung is affected, you may not have symptoms. If a
large area is affected, you may feel short of breath and have a rapid heart
rate.

A chest x-ray can tell if you have it. Treatment depends on the underlying
cause.
