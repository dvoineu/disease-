# Partner Services

'Partner services' are offered to individuals who are infected with STDs, to
their partners, and to other persons who are at increased risk for infection
in an effort to prevent transmission of these diseases and to reduce suffering
from their complications. The historical focus was to identify and locate the
sexual contacts of infected persons and other persons at risk for behavioral
or other factors and then refer them for medical examination and, as
appropriate, for treatment.

Partner services has evolved to include a broad view of the clinical and
epidemiologic activities needed to help persons infected with STDs. The basic
process - interviewing infected persons and others potentially involved in
transmission, identifying persons still at risk (whether through direct
exposure or indirect involvement), and bringing the latter to diagnosis and
treatment - has evolved along with societal, legal, and technological change.

Additionally, partner services are a clinical tool for identifying a patient's
needs and requirements and connecting the patient to appropriate care. Partner
services also provide the basis for assessing local epidemiologic conditions,
targeting resources, and evaluating program performance. Lastly, follow-up of
partners who are at risk is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of
disease transmission.
