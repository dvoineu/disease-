BEFORE LEAVING

Planning ahead of time can make your travels smoother and help you avoid
problems.

    * Talk to your health care provider or visit a travel clinic 4Â to 6 weeks before you leave for your trip. You may need to get updated (or booster) vaccinations before you leave.
    * Ask your health insurance carrier what they will cover (including emergency transport) while traveling out of the country.
    * Consider traveler's insurance if you are going outside of the United States.
    * If you are leaving your children, leave a signed consent-to-treat form with your children's caretaker.
    * If you are taking medicine, talk to your health care provider before leaving. Carry all medicines with you in your carry-on bag.
    * If traveling outside the United States, learn about the health care in the country you are visiting. If you can, find out where you would go if you needed medical help.
    * If you are planning a long flight, try to arrive as close as possible to your normal bedtime based on the time zone where you are landing. This will help prevent jet lag.
    * If you have an important event scheduled, plan to arrive 2 or 3 days in advance. This will give you time to recover from jet lag. 

IMPORTANT ITEMS TO PACK

Important items to bring with you include:

    * First aid kit
    * Immunization records
    * Insurance ID cards
    * Medical records for chronic illnesses or recent major surgery
    * Name and phone numbers of your pharmacist and health care providers
    * Nonprescription medications that you might need
    * Sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses 

ON THE ROAD

Know what steps you need to take to prevent different diseases and infections.
This includes:

    * How to avoid mosquito bites
    * What foods are safe to eat
    * Where it is safe to eat
    * How to drink water and other liquids
    * How to wash and clean your hands well 

Know how to prevent and treat traveler's diarrhea if you are visiting an area
where it is a common problem (such as Mexico).

Other tips include:

    * Be aware of vehicle safety. Use seat belts when traveling.
    * Check the local emergency number for where you are. Not all places use 911.
    * When traveling long distances, expect your body to adjust to a new time zone at the rate of about 1 hour per day. 

When traveling with children:

    * Make sure that the children know the name and telephone number of your hotel in case they get separated from you.
    * Write this information down. Put this information in a pocket or other place on their person.
    * Give children enough money to make a phone call. Make sure they know how to use the phone system where you are.
