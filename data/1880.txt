## Summary

You may need an organ transplant if one of your organs has failed. This can
happen because of illness or injury. When you have an organ transplant,
doctors remove an organ from another person and place it in your body. The
organ may come from a living donor or a donor who has died.

The organs that can be transplanted include

    * Heart
    * Intestine 
    * Kidney
    * Liver
    * Lung
    * Pancreas

You often have to wait a long time for an organ transplant. Doctors must match
donors to recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. Rejection
happens when your immune system attacks the new organ. If you have a
transplant, you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body
from rejecting the new organ.
