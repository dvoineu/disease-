## Summary

Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between
them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion
the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or
degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to
pain if the back is stressed.

A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of
the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or
back pain.

Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and,
sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments
include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and
sometimes surgery.
