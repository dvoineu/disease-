## Summary

Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally.
Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building
blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as
osteoporosis or rickets. Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and
immune systems.

You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and
from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to
sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin
cancer. So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.

Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver. Some other
foods, like milk and cereal, often have added vitamin D.

You can also take vitamin D supplements. Check with your health care provider
to see how much you should take. People who might need extra vitamin D include

    * Older adults
    * Breastfed infants
    * People with dark skin
    * People with certain conditions, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease
    * People who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgery
