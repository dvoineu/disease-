## Example of a Full Health Topic Record

A record for a MedlinePlus health topic containing most of the tags listed
above.

- <health-topic title="Acoustic Neuroma" url="https://medlineplus.gov/acousticneuroma.html" id="1624" language="English" date-created="04/22/2002">

  <also-called>Acoustic neurilemmoma</also-called>

  <also-called>Acoustic neurinoma</also-called>

  <also-called>Auditory tumor</also-called>

  <also-called>Vestibular schwannoma</also-called>

  <full-summary><p>An acoustic neuroma is a <a
href='https://medlineplus.gov/benigntumors.html'>benign tumor</a> that
develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually
grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves.
At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include</p> <ul>
<li> Loss of hearing on one side </li> <li> Ringing in ears</li> <li>
Dizziness and balance problems</li> </ul> <p>The tumor can also eventually
cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can
press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.</p> <p>Acoustic neuroma
can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of
middle ear problems. Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have
it.</p> <p>If the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked
regularly. If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.</p>
<p>If the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic
disorder called <a
href='https://medlineplus.gov/neurofibromatosis.html'>neurofibromatosis</a>.</p>
