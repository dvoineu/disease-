The factor X (ten) assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor X.
This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.

## How to Prepare for the Test

You may need to stop taking some medicines before this test. Your health care
provider will tell you which ones.

## How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.
Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing
or slight bruising. This soon goes away.

## Why the Test is Performed

This test may be used to find the cause of excessive bleeding (decreased blood
clotting). The decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of
factor X.

## Normal Results

A normal value is 50% to 200% of the laboratory control or reference value.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs
use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your
provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Decreased factor X activity may be related to:

    * Disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs (amyloidosis)
    * Factor X deficiencyÂ (a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor X)
    * Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active (disseminated intravascular coagulation)
    * Fat malabsorption (not absorbing enough fat from your diet)
    * Heparin use
    * Liver disease
    * Vitamin K deficiency
    * Taking blood thinners

## Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries
vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the
other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than
from others.

Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:

    * Excessive bleeding
    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Multiple punctures to locate veins
    * Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)

This test is most often performed on people who have bleeding problems. The
risk of excessive bleeding is slightly greater than for people without
bleeding problems.

## Alternative Names

Stuart-Prower factor
