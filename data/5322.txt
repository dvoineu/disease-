Even if you feel fine, you should still see your health care provider for
regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For
example, the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have
it checked regularly. High blood sugar and high cholesterol levels also may
not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for
these conditions.
