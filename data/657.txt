## Summary

Measles is an infectious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily from
person to person. It causes a blotchy red rash. The rash often starts on the
head and moves down the body. Other symptoms include

    * Fever
    * Cough
    * Runny nose
    * Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
    * Feeling achy and run down
    * Tiny white spots inside the mouth

Sometimes measles can lead to serious problems. There is no treatment for
measles, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.

"German measles", also known as rubella, is a completely different illness.
