The conference committee is looking for NACCHO 360 session proposals under the following topic tracks: Emerging Trends in Public Health Policy and Law, Leadership and Workforce Development, Community Engagement and Healthcare Linkages, Healthy Behaviors, Equity and Social Justice, and Applying Information and Technology to Improve Essential Public Health Services. The abstract submission period is open through January 16, 2020. Read more about abstract requirements and submission guidelines at NACCHO.

Watch a new short video from CDC's Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support, which highlights key findings of the grant's evaluation. Collectively, grantees are using their funds to 1) improve their ability to collect essential data, 2) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of operations, programs, and services, 3) address emerging public health needs or problems, and 4) implement public health interventions that are known to work.
