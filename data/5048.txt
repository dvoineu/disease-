The term "meningitis" describes inflammation of the membranes (meninges)
and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds and protects the brain and
spinal cord. Meningitis can result from many causes, both infectious and non-
infectious. Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening condition that requires
prompt recognition and treatment. Beyond the newborn period, the most common
causes of bacterial meningitis are _Neisseria meningitidis_ , _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ , and _Haemophilus influenzae_. All three of these organisms are
respiratory pathogens. They are spread from person to person by close contact
with respiratory secretions. Once acquired, each species can colonize the
mucosa of the nasopharynx and oropharynx, which is known as pharyngeal
carriage. From there, they may cross the mucosa and enter the blood. Once in
the blood, they can reach the meninges, causing meningitis, or other body
sites causing other syndromes. Over 1.2 million cases of bacterial meningitis
are estimated to occur worldwide each year (24). The incidence and case-
fatality rates for bacterial meningitis vary by region, country, pathogen, and
age group. Without treatment, the case-fatality rate can be as high as 70
percent, and one in five survivors of bacterial meningitis may be left with
permanent sequelae including hearing loss, neurologic disability, or loss of a
limb (18).

## _Neisseria meningitidis_

_N. meningitidis_ may either be encapsulated or unencapsulated. However,
nearly all invasive _N. meningitidis_ organisms are encapsulated, or
surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule. This capsular polysaccharide is used
to classify _N. meningitidis_ into 12 serogroups. Six of these serogroups
cause the great majority of infections in people: A, B, C, W135, X, and Y
(12). Incidence rates of _N. meningitidis_ meningitis are generally highest in
children less than five years of age and in adolescents. _N. meningitidis_ can
also cause a severe bacteremia, called meningococcemia. The worldwide
distribution of serogroups of _N. meningitidis_ is variable. In the Americas,
Europe, and Australia, serogroups B and C are the most common, while serogroup
A causes the majority of disease in Africa and Asia (7). Sometimes serogroups
can emerge, increasing in importance in a specific country or region, like
serogroup C in China (20) or serogroup Y in North America (15, 17, 23).

Worldwide, the incidence of meningitis due to _N. meningitidis_ is highest in
a region of sub-Saharan African known as the "meningitis belt" (Figure 1).
This hyper-endemic region extends from Senegal to Ethiopia, and is
characterized by seasonal epidemics during the dry season (incidence rate:
10-100 cases per 100,000 population), punctuated by explosive epidemics in
8-12 year cycles (incidence rates can be greater than 1,000 cases per 100,000
population). Across the meningitis belt, at least 350 million people are at
risk for meningitis during these annual epidemics. Meningitis epidemics are
generally caused by serogroup A, although outbreaks have also been caused by
serogroups C, W135, and X (1-3, 7, 13, 21, 28). Outbreaks of different
serogroups may overlap, therefore, laboratory confirmation is important both
to recognize and monitor the progression of outbreaks (5-7).

parts of Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and
Cameroon.](/meningitis/lab-manual/images/map-africa.jpg)

## _Haemophilus influenzae_

_H. influenzae_ , like _N. meningitidis_ , may be either unencapsulated or
encapsulated with a polysaccharide capsule. The makeup of this polysaccharide
capsule allows encapsulated _H. influenzae_ isolates to be classified into six
serotypes (a, b, c, d, e, and f) with the most common cause of invasive
disease being _H. influenzae_ type b (Hib). Though _H. influenzae_ meningitis
is rare in adolescents and adults, rates of meningitis due to Hib are highest
in children less than five years of age, with an estimated incidence rate of
31 cases per 100,000 (22). In young children, the case-fatality rate for
meningitis due to _H. influenzae_ is generally higher than that for meningitis
due to _N. meningitidis_. In addition to meningitis, _H. influenzae_ is also
an important cause of pneumonia as well as epiglottitis. While the worldwide
burden of disease caused by _H. influenzae_ is not completely understood, lab
networks supporting surveillance systems such as Paediatric Bacterial
Meningitis (PBM) and Invasive Bacterial Diseases (IBD) contribute standardized
disease burden data.

## _Streptococcus pneumoniae_

_S. pneumoniae_ , like _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ , is an
encapsulated bacterium. The diversity of capsular types is large, with more
than 93 serotypes recognized based on the composition of the capsular
polysaccharide. Many _S. pneumoniae_ serotypes are capable of causing invasive
disease, including meningitis, bloodstream infections, and pneumonia; however,
most disease worldwide is caused by a small number of common serotypes (8).
The relative contribution of each serotype to the local burden of disease
varies globally, with serotypes 1 and 5 more prominent in developing
countries. _S. pneumoniae_ and Hib disease may vary seasonally, and while they
do not cause epidemics like _N. meningitidis_ , large outbreaks do occur
rarely (4, 12) _._ Meningitis due to _S. pneumoniae_ occurs most commonly in
the very young and the very old, with an estimated incidence rate of 17 cases
per 100,000 population in children less than five years of age (14). The case
fatality rate for meningitis due to _S. pneumoniae_ in children less than five
years of age exceeds 73% in some parts of the world.

## Prevention and control

The risk of secondary cases of meningococcal disease among close contacts of
someone with meningococcal disease (i.e., household members, day-care center
contacts, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions) is
high. In non-epidemic settings, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is effective in
preventing secondary cases among close contacts by eliminating nasopharyngeal
carriage if administered rapidly after the index case is identified. Such
intervention may not be feasible in many countries. Mass chemoprophylaxis to
prevent/control epidemics is not recommended. Secondary cases are also seen
for Hib meningitis, particularly in unvaccinated children less than 4 years of
age who are exposed to someone with Hib disease. Oral rifampin is recommended
to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage and prevent disease in these children.
Secondary meningitis cases are very rare among those exposed to a patient with
pneumococcal disease.

Laboratory surveillance data are critical to tracking the spread of less
susceptible strains and to providing guidance in the empirical selection of
antimicrobial agents. For all three bacterial meningitis pathogens,
antimicrobial resistance has been identified, affecting the treatment of
patients and chemoprophylaxis of close contacts. _N. meningitidis_ isolates
resistant to sulfonamides are common in many countries. Isolates resistant to
rifampicin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, ceftriaxone, and
ciprofloxacin have also been identified (27). One report from the United
States described 2 isolates which were rifampin resistant (16). Resistance to
beta-lactam antimicrobials is common in _H. influenzae_ isolates; the majority
of which produce beta-lactamase. _S. pneumoniae_ isolates have been reported
with resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline, and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The increasing proportion of pneumococci
resistant to penicillin and the development of resistance to ceftriaxone has
huge implications for treatment and makes prevention through vaccination that
much more important. The introduction of vaccine in the United States has
resulted in a decreasing proportion of invasive isolates that are antibiotic-
resistant, thus vaccine may have a role in controlling the spread of
antibiotic resistance (10).

Vaccines are the cornerstone of prevention and control of bacterial
meningitis. Vaccines for _N. meningitidis_ made up of capsular polysaccharide
have been available and used since the 1970s. These include a bivalent vaccine
(serogroups A and C), a trivalent vaccine (A, C, Y), and a quadrivalent
vaccine (A, C, W135, and Y). Timely mass-vaccination campaigns using
polysaccharide vaccines can effectively interrupt the course of meningitis
epidemics, but they are less effective in young children, do not provide long
duration of protection, do not have sustained impact on nasopharyngeal
carriage, and therefore do not interrupt person to person transmission. For
this reason, they do not result in "herd immunity", which is the extension of
protection to unvaccinated people in the community.

In 2010, a new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed, pre-
qualified by WHO, and introduced in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger (11).
Conjugate vaccines generally result in higher levels of protection, longer
duration of protection, protection of children less than 2 years of age, and
may interrupt nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in herd
immunity. When implemented in national preventive vaccination programs across
the meningitis belt, it is hoped that the vaccine will prevent the occurrence
of serogroup A epidemics. Traditional public health and bacteriologic
surveillance, as well as molecular epidemiology, will play a crucial role in
evaluating both the short- and long-term impact of these vaccination programs.
For example, the need for vaccines to other serogroups, the potential re-
emergence of serogroup A due to waning vaccine-induced immunity, or the
emergence of new serogroups will only become evident through ongoing, high-
quality surveillance.

Polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines for Hib are available for young
children. In most industrialized countries, these vaccines have dramatically
decreased the burden of Hib meningitis and virtually eliminated it as a public
health problem through direct effects and induction of herd immunity without
significant strain replacement. More recently, many developing countries have
introduced, or plan to introduce, Hib vaccines through various global
initiatives, such as the Hib Initiative and the GAVI Alliance, whose goals are
to accelerate introduction of Hib vaccines in low and middle income countries.

A 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is available for _S. pneumoniae_. Like
other polysaccharide vaccines, it is not effective in children younger than
two years of age; the group with the highest risk of _S. pneumoniae_
meningitis. Newer polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines have been
introduced in many industrialized countries, leading to dramatic declines in
pneumococcal meningitis in infants and young children and in adults through
induction of herd immunity (9). Currently, 7-valent, 10-valent, and 13-valent
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been developed and have received WHO
prequalification. In some settings, serotypes not covered by the 7-valent
conjugate vaccine have increased somewhat following 7-valent conjugate vaccine
introduction (25). As with Hib vaccine, global initiatives such as PneumoADIP
and the GAVI Alliance have helped to accelerate introduction of these vaccines
in low and middle income countries. As of the end of 2010, 42 countries were
using a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for routine infant immunization,
including 3 low-income countries, and as many as 15 more low-income countries
are slated to introduce vaccine in 2011 (26).

## Role of the laboratory

Microbiologists play a critical role in gathering data both for clinical and
public health decision making. Efficient and accurate microbiologic diagnosis
of bacterial meningitis guides the choice of antibiotics and other treatment
options for the patient. Collectively, serogroup or serotype results from
isolates of bacterial meningitis in an effected population guide response
efforts and determine the appropriate vaccine to be used. Similarly,
microbiologic surveillance is critical to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy
through the identification of local resistance profiles. Thus, the role of the
microbiology laboratory is essential to preventing morbidity and mortality
from bacterial meningitis.

Infection with _N. meningitidis_ may be acquired through working with
bacterial isolates in the microbiology laboratory if appropriate protective
procedures are not followed (19). Microbiologists who routinely work with
these isolates are at increased risk for infection. This risk highlights the
importance of consistent adherence to biosafety procedures. In addition,
vaccination against meningococcal disease is recommended for microbiologists
who routinely work with _N. meningitidis_ , and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis
should be used if lapses in biosafety procedures result in exposure to the
organism.
