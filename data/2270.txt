## Overview

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is associated with the
aging process. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease causing the deterioration
of the cartilage within a joint.

For most people, the cause of osteoarthritis is unknown, but metabolic,
genetic, chemical, and mechanical factors play a role in its development.
Symptoms of osteoarthritis include loss of flexibility, limited movement, and
pain and swelling within the joint. The condition results from injury to the
cartilage, which normally absorbs stress and covers the bones, so they can
move smoothly.

The cartilage of the affected joint is roughened and becomes worn down. As the
disease progresses, the cartilage becomes completely worn down and the bone
rubs on bone. Bony spurs usually develop around the margins of the joint.

Part of the pain results from these bone spurs, which can restrict the joint's
movement as well.
