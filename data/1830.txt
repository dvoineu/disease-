**Hepatitis A** is a vaccine-preventable, communicable disease of the liver
caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is usually transmitted person-to-
person through the fecal-oral route or consumption of contaminated food or
water. Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic
infection. Most adults with hepatitis A have symptoms, including fatigue, low
appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice, that usually resolve within 2
months of infection; most children less than 6 years of age do not have
symptoms or have an unrecognized infection. Antibodies produced in response to
hepatitis A infection last for life and protect against reinfection. The best
way to prevent hepatitis A infection is to get vaccinated.
