## How are MedlinePlus and MEDLINE/PubMed connected?

MedlinePlus and MEDLINE/PubMed are resources from the National Library of
Medicine, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Although these
resources provide different kinds of information, they are interconnected.

Health topic pages on MedlinePlus contain links to topic-specific searches of
PubMed. These searches, which are created by medical librarians, can help you
find references and abstracts for the latest articles in the professional
biomedical literature.

A service called LinkOut provides links from PubMed to a wide range of
additional information and resources, including pages on MedlinePlus that are
related to particular journal citations.
