![Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2011 prevalence data showing
percentage of adult population by state or territory that reported ever being
told by a physician or health professional that they had chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease \(COPD\), chronic bronchitis, or
emphysema](/copd/images/COPD-prevalence-by-state.jpg)

COPD fact sheets are available. Each fact sheet also includes a figure showing
health and health care characteristics by COPD status. Data are from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

In 2011, some states also collected additional information from BRFSS
respondents with COPD about diagnostic procedures, daily medication use,
doctor visits, hospital or emergency room visits, and how shortness of breath
affects quality of life. In many states, the addition of these questions was
supported by an interagency collaboration between the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute and CDC.
