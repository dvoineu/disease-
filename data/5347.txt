Most of the time, it is fine to travel while pregnant. As long as you are
comfortable and safe, you should be able to travel. It is still a good idea to
talk to your provider if you are planning a trip.

When you travel, you should:

    * Eat as you normally do.
    * Drink plenty of fluids.
    * Wear comfortable shoes and clothing that isn't tight.
    * Take crackers and juice with you to avoid nausea.
    * Bring a copy of your prenatal care records with you.
    * Get up and walk every hour. It will help your circulation and keep swelling down. Being inactive for long periods of time and being pregnant both increase your risk for blood clots in your legs and lungs. To lower your risk, drink plenty of fluids and move around often. 

Get medical care right away if you have:

    * Chest pain
    * Leg or calf pain or swelling, especially in just one leg
    * Shortness of breath 

DO NOT take over-the-counter medicines or any non-prescribed medicines without
talking to your provider. This includes medicine for motion sickness or bowel
problems.
