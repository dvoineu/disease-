## Summary

Constipation means that a person has three or fewer bowel movements in a week.
The stool can be hard and dry. Sometimes it is painful to pass. At one time or
another, almost everyone gets constipated. In most cases, it lasts a short
time and is not serious.

There are many things you can do to prevent constipation. They include

    * Eating more fruits, vegetables and grains, which are high in fiber
    * Drinking plenty of water and other liquids
    * Getting enough exercise
    * Taking time to have a bowel movement when you need to
    * Using laxatives only if your doctor says you should
    * Asking your doctor if medicines you take may cause constipation

It's not important that you have a bowel movement every day. If your bowel
habits change, however, check with your doctor.
