States can play an important role in treatments for children with ADHD. They
can monitor how health resources are utilized, implement ADHD treatment
policies, and shape access to behavioral health services. CDC promotes the use
of effective treatments for children with ADHD, and a vital part of this
effort is providing states with resources to guide decision-making.
