## Summary

Impaired driving is dangerous. It's the cause of more than half of all car
crashes. It means operating a motor vehicle while you are affected by

    * Alcohol
    * Legal or illegal drugs
    * Sleepiness
    * Distractions, such as using a cell phone or texting
    * Having a medical condition which affects your driving

For your safety and the safety of others, do not drive while impaired. Have
someone else drive you or take public transportation when you cannot drive. If
you need to take a call or send a text message, pull over.
