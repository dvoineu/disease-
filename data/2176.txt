## Summary

Your peripheral nerves are the ones outside your brain and spinal cord. Like
static on a telephone line, peripheral nerve disorders distort or interrupt
the messages between the brain and the rest of the body.

There are more than 100 kinds of peripheral nerve disorders. They can affect
one nerve or many nerves. Some are the result of other diseases, like diabetic
nerve problems. Others, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, happen after a virus
infection. Still others are from nerve compression, like carpal tunnel
syndrome or thoracic outlet syndrome. In some cases, like complex regional
pain syndrome and brachial plexus injuries, the problem begins after an
injury. Some people are born with peripheral nerve disorders.

Symptoms often start gradually, and then get worse. They include

    * Numbness
    * Pain
    * Burning or tingling
    * Muscle weakness
    * Sensitivity to touch

Treatment aims to treat any underlying problem, reduce pain and control
symptoms.
