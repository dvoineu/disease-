## Summary

A cochlear implant is a small, complex electronic device that can help to
provide a sense of sound. People who are profoundly deaf or severely hard-of-
hearing can get help from them. The implant consists of two parts. One part
sits on the outside of the body, behind the ear. A second part is surgically
placed under the skin.

An implant does not restore normal hearing. It can help a person understand
speech. Children and adults can benefit from them.
