H5N1 Genetic Changes Inventory

### Background

Since highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses were first
identified in humans in 1997, they have evolved rapidly and have formed
multiple distinct genetic clades. During this time HPAI viruses have caused
millions of deaths among birds and over six hundred deaths in humans.

Laboratory studies have implicated convergent evolution of certain molecular
determinants for pathogenicity and host specificity for influenza viruses in
nature; however, our understanding of the precise molecular determinants
required for transmissibility and severe disease in mammals remains
incomplete. It is believed that there are likely to be multiple evolutionary
pathways that would increase mammalian transmissibility of avian influenza
viruses, including HPAI H5N1 viruses.

In light of the expanding host range, geographic spread, and the effect of co-
circulation of heterogeneous viruses on interspecies transmission of H5N1
viruses, it is critical that enhanced approaches to influenza surveillance are
maintained. Early detection of the natural emergence of genetic changes that
may enhance adaptation of HPAI H5N1 viruses for humans and/or other mammals or
may impair antiviral interventions is an essential component of this effort.
The WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza Reference and Research at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, with input from many
influenza subject matter experts from around the world, has developed an
inventory of amino acid mutations in H5N1 viruses that is intended to be used
by the influenza surveillance and research community as a tool to inform the
influenza knowledge base for surveillance and public health preparedness.

### H5N1 Inventory

The H5N1 Inventory supports a molecular-based approach for surveillance and
should be used to identify genetic mutations that determine viral phenotypic
characteristics of importance. The H5N1 Inventory is an inclusive compilation
of amino acid changes and/or motifs identified within each viral protein that
affect one or more biological properties, provided in broad categories.
References to manuscripts in the relevant published literature describing
these relationships are provided; citations are representative of the
published literature and are not intended to be all inclusive. This H5N1
inventory will be updated periodically by the WHO CC for Influenza at the CDC
in collaboration with international partners and will be available online with
a date stamp indicating when the list was updated.

### How to Use the H5N1 Inventory

The H5N1 Inventory should be used by those conducting surveillance in humans
and animals as well as research on influenza H5N1 viruses as a reference for
the identification of specific mutations in naturally occurring H5N1 viruses
that may signal adaptation to mammalian species or alter susceptibility to
existing antivirals. Surveillance and research teams that identify viruses
with mutations of concern should alert a relevant WHO Collaborating Center or
an H5N1 reference laboratory and submit the virus for further characterization
and risk assessment. Contact information for these laboratories can be found
on the World Health Organization (WHO) websiteExternal and the OIE
websiteExternal. Please ensure that your national veterinary services are
informed when influenza viruses are detected in animals. All H5N1 avian
influenza viruses in poultry and all HPAI viruses in birds are notifiable to
OIE; please consult
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htmExternal
for further information about the definition of notifiable avian influenza.

### How the H5N1 Inventory Was Created

The H5N1 Inventory is based on published and publically available information
identified in two ways: i) a review of the literature by influenza subject
matter experts and ii) a bioinformatics text mining process using key words to
search the existing PubMed H5N1 literature to identify relevant published
materials. The following criteria were used for inclusion in theH5N1
Inventory: i) studies in mammalian cell culture, human specimens or tissues;
studies in laboratory animals (mice, ferrets, guinea pigs); ii) mutations or
motifs that were introduced into HPAI H5N1 viruses by reverse genetics or
arose through repeated passage in the above mammalian systems or were
identified through genetic sequence comparison of wild type viruses with
different phenotypes; iii) studies on the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) which
introduced mutations into recombinant proteins, recombinant viruses or pseudo
viruses bearing an H5 HA; iv) mutations that affect the following properties:
receptor binding (increased binding to α2,6 sialic acid as measured by in
vitro assays); altered binding profiles or tropism for human airway tissues;
replication efficiency (plaque morphology, cell culture or tissue viral
titers, temperature sensitivity); virulence and transmissibility in animal
models; altered polymerase complex activity in in vitro assays; altered host
response including cell signaling pathways that may alter host antiviral
response; altered susceptibility of N1 subtype viruses (H5N1, former seasonal
H1N1 and H1N1pdm) to licensed neuraminidase (NA) and M2 inhibitors in
functional assays detected in field isolates or clinical case reports; and
animals or cultured cells treated with drugs. H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004)
amino acid numbering for the mature proteins has been used throughout.
