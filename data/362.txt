## Summary

Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight,
which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat,
and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than
what's considered healthy for his or her height.

Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance
between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that
might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-
fat foods, and not being physically active.

Obesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and
some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight
can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10
to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.
