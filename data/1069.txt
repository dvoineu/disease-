_CDC 's Community Approaches to Reducing Sexually Transmitted Diseases (CARS)
initiative to enable funded recipients to extend the reach of STD prevention
services._

Using community engagement methods and partnerships to build local STD
prevention and control capacity, the purpose of the CARS project is to support
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of innovative, interdisciplinary
interventions to:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Identify societal issues (e.g., access to quality health care) that contribute to disparities and develop interventions to address those societal issues;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * promote personal health; and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * advance community wellness.

CARS projects accomplish their goals through community advisory boards,
collaborative partnerships that leverage provider and community resources and
expertise. CARS awardees identify social determinants of health, implement
interventions to reduce STDs, and improve health equity. These interventions
include enhancing STD and personal health services for adolescent minorities
and young adults, including teens, young minority men who have sex with men
(MSM), and LGBT youth. All strategies and activities address both individual
and structural factors to promote community wellness that will facilitate
better public health outcomes (e.g., STD screening coverage of chlamydia,
gonorrhea, and syphilis and vaccination for hepatitis A and B, and human
papillomavirus).
