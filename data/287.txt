## Summary

A burn is damage to your body's tissues caused by heat, chemicals,
electricity, sunlight, or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam,
building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of
burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke.

There are three types of burns:

  * First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin 
  * Second-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneath
  * Third-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneath

Burns can cause swelling, blistering, scarring and, in serious cases, shock,
and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your
skin's protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the
burn, how deep it is, and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams
can prevent or treat infections. For more serious burns, treatment may be
needed to clean the wound, replace the skin, and make sure the patient has
enough fluids and nutrition.
