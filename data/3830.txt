MMWR Report: Screening for Alcohol Use and Brief Counseling of Adults

## Why is Alcohol SBI Important?

##### Excessive Alcohol Use* is Common

**Binge Drinking** †--More than 37 million American adults binge drink.1

**Heavy Drinking* --** In 2013, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System survey, about 6 percent of the adult population reported
heavy drinking.2

**Pregnant Women*** --During 2015-2017, 1 in 9 (11.5%) pregnant women aged
18-44 years in the United States reported drinking alcohol in the past 30
days. Among pregnant women who reported consuming alcohol, one-third engaged
in binge drinking. _3_

**Youth under 21 years of age*** **--** In 2017, 60.4 percent of high school
students had at least one drink of alcohol, on at least one day during their
life (i.e. ever drank alcohol). _4_

##### Excessive Alcohol Use Leads to Widespread Harm

**Alcohol & Pregnancy**--Drinking any alcohol during pregnancy can cause a
range of physical, behavioral, and learning problems, called fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASDs).5 Additionally, drinking during pregnancy is a risk
factor for other poor pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage and stillbirth.6

**Health & Social Harm**--Excessive alcohol use contributes to a wide range of
negative health and social consequences, including motor vehicle crashes and
intimate partner violence; over time, it can result in serious medical
conditions, such as high blood pressure, digestive problems, liver disease,
and various cancers.

**Costly & Fatal**--In 2010, excessive alcohol use cost the United States
about $249 billion, _7_ accounting for an estimated 88,000 deaths per year
from 2006 to 2010.1

##### Effective Clinical Interventions are Available

**Alcohol SBI Works** --More than 30 years of research has shown that alcohol
SBI is effective at reducing excessive alcohol use. Based on this evidence,
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, _8_ as well as many other
organizations, have recommended that alcohol SBI be implemented for all
adults, in primary healthcare settings.

In 2012, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended the use of
alcohol electronic SBIexternal icon (eSBI). _9_

### About CDC's Alcohol SBI Activities

**CDC 's alcohol SBI initiative** includes efforts to support alcohol SBI
implementation in medical and other settings, improve tracking of alcohol SBI
implementation, and identify and partner with healthcare providers, health
systems, and health plans to develop and implement system-level strategies
that foster alcohol SBI implementation.
