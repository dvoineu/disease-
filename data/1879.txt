## Summary

Tendons are flexible bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. They help
your muscles move your bones. Tendinitis is the severe swelling of a tendon.

Tendinitis usually happens after repeated injury to an area such as the wrist
or ankle. It causes pain and soreness around a joint. Some common forms of
tendinitis are named after the sports that increase their risk. They include
tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, pitcher's shoulder, swimmer's shoulder, and
jumper's knee.

Doctors diagnose tendinitis with your medical history, a physical exam, and
imaging tests. The first step in treatment is to reduce pain and swelling.
Rest, wrapping or elevating the affected area, and medicines can help. Ice is
helpful for recent, severe injuries. Other treatments include ultrasound,
physical therapy, steroid injections, and surgery.
