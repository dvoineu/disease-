#  Arsenic

## Summary

Arsenic is a natural element found in soil and minerals. Arsenic compounds are
used to preserve wood, as pesticides, and in some industries. Arsenic can get
into air, water, and the ground from wind-blown dust. It may also get into
water from runoff.

You may be exposed to arsenic by

    * Taking in small amounts in food, drinking water, or air 
    * Breathing sawdust or burning smoke from arsenic-treated wood 
    * Living in an area with high levels of arsenic in rock
    * Working in a job where arsenic is made or used

Exposure to arsenic can cause many health problems. Being exposed to low
levels for a long time can change the color of your skin. It can cause corns
and small warts. Exposure to high levels of arsenic can cause death.
