## Summary

The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra
water. It includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Urinary
tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the
body.

You may have a UTI if you notice

  * Pain or burning when you urinate
  * Fever, tiredness, or shakiness
  * An urge to urinate often
  * Pressure in your lower belly 
  * Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddish
  * Pain in your back or side below the ribs

People of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get
UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes, need a tube to
drain your bladder, or have a spinal cord injury.

If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor
can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test. Treatment is with antibiotics.
