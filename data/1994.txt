## Summary

People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common
ones include

    * Circulation problems from atherosclerosis or diabetes. They may cause you to need an amputation.
    * Traumatic injuries, including from traffic accidents and military combat
    * Cancer
    * Birth defects

If you are missing an arm or leg, an artificial limb can sometimes replace it.
The device, which is called a prosthesis, can help you to perform daily
activities such as walking, eating, or dressing. Some artificial limbs let you
function nearly as well as before.
