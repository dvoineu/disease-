The risk of acquiring _Giardia_ infection from your pet is small. However,
there are some steps you can take to lower your risk.

_Giardia intestinalis (_ aka: _Giardia duodenalis, Giardia lamblia)_ is a
common, microscopic (intestinal) parasite that commonly affects humans, dogs,
and cats 1,2.

Common signs and symptoms of _Giardia_ infection (in both humans and pets) are
diarrhea, gas, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. However, it is
possible to be infected and have no signs or symptoms of illness 1,3,4.

Please visit our other web pages for a more detailed description of _Giardia_
, including its life cycle, prevention tips, and treatment information for
humans.

Can I get Giardia infection from my pet?

The risk of humans acquiring _Giardia_ infection from dogs or cats is small
4-7. The exact type of _Giardia_ that infects humans is usually not the same
type that infects dogs and cats 5-7.

**Note:** If you own other household or exotic pets, please contact your
veterinarian. Seek further information, as some rodents and other species can
harbor human strains of _Giardia._

How is _Giardia_ spread?

Anything that comes into contact with feces (poop) from infected humans or
animals can become contaminated with the _Giardia_ parasite. People and
animals become infected when they swallow the parasite. It is not possible to
become infected through contact with blood.

How do I protect myself if my dog or cat has a _Giardia_ infection?

The risk of acquiring _Giardia_ infection from your dog or cat is small.
However, there are some steps you can take to minimize your exposure to
_Giardia_ if you have dogs or cats:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Wear gloves when gardening to reduce the risk of coming into contact with infected feces (poop) or soil.

How do I reduce the amount of _Giardia_ in my yard or outdoor environment?

_Giardia_ is hard to completely eliminate from the environment, but there are
things you can do to help decrease the risk of pet reinfection and of human
infection. Please remember that despite your best efforts to clean the
environment, _Giardia_ can persist in outdoor spaces and pet reinfection is
possible 4.

How do I prevent my dog or cat from getting re-infected, or sickening my other
pets, during treatment?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * If you have other dogs or cats, make sure you tell your veterinarian even if they are not showing signs of diarrhea. Other pets may also be put on medicine depending on the situation. Even animals showing no signs of _Giardia_ infection could be infected and shedding _Giardia_ into the environment 4.
