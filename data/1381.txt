****Expanding or refining your search****

Using the tips below will help to improve your search results.

Case sensitivity | Searches are not case sensitive. Use either upper or lower
case.  
---|---  
Refining your search | Refine or narrow your search by adding more words to
the search terms you have already entered. For example "flu in children" could
be modified to "flu in adults and children"  
Phrase search | Phrase searches are helpful when you are searching on specific
terms. To use phrase search add parentheses around the term. For example,
"childhood vaccines schedule"  
Word exclusion | If your search term has more than one meaning, you can focus
your search by adding a minus sign ("-") in front of words related to the
meaning you want to avoid. For example you can enter in "Flu -children" to
view search results for flu but does not include children. Make sure that you
have a space between the term and the term with the minus sign.  
Stemming | Stemming your search will search for not only your requested term
but terms that are similar to that term. To use stemming add and "*" to the
end of your search term.
