## Summary

Tubal ligation (getting your "tubes tied") is a type of surgery. It prevents a
woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control, and is
effective right away.

The surgery cuts, ties, or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path
between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to
fertilize it, and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a
hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes.
Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal
activities within a few days.

Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery, and
does not always work.
