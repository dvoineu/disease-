### Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was landmark legislation in the United States,
which outlawed racial segregation in schools, public places, and employment.
The act was designed to help African Americans. However, the bill was amended
prior to passage to protect women, and included whites for the first time. It
also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is the agency
responsible for enforcing Title VII.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on
race, color, sex, religion or national origin. It also prohibits reprisal or
retaliation for participating in the EEO process or for opposing any unlawful
employment practice covered by Title VII. The law also requires that employers
reasonably accommodate applicants' and employees' sincerely held religious
practices, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of
the employer's business.

discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation
or lawsuit.

### Equal Pay Act of 1963

This law protects men and women who perform substantially equal work in the
same establishment from sex-based wage discrimination. Specifically, it
prohibits employers from paying employees of one sex less wages than those of
the opposite sex who perform equal work. Equal work means that the jobs being
compared required equal skills, effort and responsibilities, and are performed
under similar working conditions.

### Title I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990

This Act was signed into law on July 26, 1990 by President George H. W. Bush,
the ADA provides a wide range of civil rights protection for individuals with
disabilities. Titles I and V prohibits employment discrimination against
qualified individuals with disabilities in private businesses and in state and
local governments (covering both mental and physical impairments that limit
major life activities), but who are otherwise qualified for employment.

The ADA prohibits discrimination in all employment practices, including job
application procedures, hiring, firing, training, compensation, advancement,
and any other terms, conditions or privileges of employment. The ADA does not
require preferential treatment of individuals with disabilities, as employers
are free to select the most qualified applicant for the position, but it does
prohibit discrimination based solely on a candidate's real or perceived
disability.

### Civil Rights Act of 1991

This Act is a United States statute that was passed in response to a series of
United States Supreme Court decisions which limited the rights of employees
who had sued their employers for discrimination. The Act represented the first
effort since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to modify some of the
basic procedural and substantive rights provided by federal law in employment
discrimination cases. It provided for the right to trial by jury on
discrimination claims and introduced the possibility of emotional distress
damages, while limiting the amount that a jury could award.

The 1991 Act combined elements from two different civil rights acts of the
past: the Civil Rights Ac of 1866, better known by the number assigned to it
in the codification of federal laws as "Section 1981", and the employment-
related provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, generally referred to as
"Title VII". The two statutes, passed nearly a century apart, approached the
issue of employment discrimination very differently: Section 1981 prohibited
only discrimination based on race or color, while Title VII also prohibited
discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, and national origin. Section
1981, which had lain dormant and unenforced for a century after its passage,
allowed plaintiffs to seek compensatory damages and trial by jury; Title VII,
passed in the 1960s when it was assumed that Southern juries could not render
a fair verdict, allowed only trial by the court and provided for only
traditional equitable remedies: backpay, reinstatement and injunctions against
future acts of discrimination. By the time the 1991 Act was passed both
allowed for an award of attorney's fees.

### The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)

_**Effective - November 21, 2009.**_  
This law makes it illegal to discriminate against employees or applicants
because of genetic information. Genetic information includes information about
an individual's genetic tests and the genetic tests of an individual's family
members, as well as information about any disease, disorder or condition of an
individual's family members (i.e. an individual's family medical history). The
law also makes it illegal to retaliate against a person because the person
complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or
participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.

### Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act
of 2002

Section 301 of the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and
Retaliation Act of 2002 (the No Fear Act), requires each federal agency to
post summary statistical data pertaining to complaints of employment
discrimination filed against it by employees, former employees and applicants
for employment under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. The specific data to be posted is
described in section 301(b) of the Act and 29 CFR 1614.704. The required
summary statistical data for EEO complaints filed against the CDC is available
below.

In addition, section 302 of the No Fear Act requires CDC to post government-
wide, summary statistical data pertaining to hearings requested under 29
C.F.R. Part 1614 and appeals filed with EEOC. The specific data to be posted
is described in section 302(a) of the Act and 29 CFR 1614.706. That data is
also available below. The posting of EEO data on agency public web sites is
intended to assist Congress, Federal agencies and the public to assess whether
and the extent to which agencies are living up to their equal employment
opportunity responsibilities.
