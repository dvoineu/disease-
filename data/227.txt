## Summary

Some people have naturally straight teeth that fit together. But if you have
problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth, you may need orthodontic
care. Orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of
the teeth and jaw.

Orthodontic care involves the use of devices, such as braces, to

  * Straighten teeth
  * Correct problems with bite
  * Close gaps between teeth
  * Align lips and teeth properly 

Most people who receive orthodontic care are kids, but adults get braces, too.
In young children, orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can
help permanent teeth to come in properly. Straight permanent teeth can help
prevent tooth problems later on.
