## Summary

Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a parasite. It
spreads from person to person during sex. Many people do not have any
symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually happen within 5 to 28 days
after being infected.

It can cause vaginitis in women. Symptoms include

  * Yellow-green or gray discharge from the vagina
  * Discomfort during sex
  * Vaginal odor
  * Painful urination
  * Itching burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva

Most men do not have symptoms. If they do, they may have

  * Itching or irritation inside the penis
  * Burning after urination or ejaculation
  * Discharge from the penis

Trichomoniasis can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually
transmitted diseases. Pregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to
give birth too early, and their babies are more likely have a low birth
weight.

Lab tests can tell if you have the infection. Treatment is with antibiotics.
If you are infected, you and your partner must be treated.

Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the
risk of catching or spreading trichomoniasis. The most reliable way to avoid
infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.
