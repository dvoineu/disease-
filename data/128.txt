## **What is COPD?**

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, refers to a group of diseases
that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. It includes
emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD makes breathing difficult for the 16
million Americans who have this disease. Millions more people suffer from
COPD, but have not been diagnosed and are not being treated. Although there is
no cure for COPD, it can be treated.
