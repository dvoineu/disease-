## Summary

If you have Tourette syndrome, you make unusual movements or sounds, called
tics. You have little or no control over them. Common tics are throat-clearing
and blinking. You may repeat words, spin, or, rarely, blurt out swear words.

Tourette syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system. It often occurs with
other problems, such as

    * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD)
    * Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
    * Anxiety
    * Depression

The cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown. It is more common in boys than
girls. The tics usually start in childhood and may be worst in the early
teens. Many people eventually outgrow them.

No treatment is needed unless the tics interfere with everyday life.
Excitement or worry can make tics worse. Calm, focused activities may make
them better. Medicines and talk therapy may also help.
