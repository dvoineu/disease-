This map shows the percentage of adults between 50 and 75 years old in each
state who said they were up-to-date on colorectal cancer screening in 2016.

**The percentage of adults in the United States who are up-to-date with
colorectal cancer screening is going up in most states.**

Of the types of cancer that affect both men and women, colorectal (colon)
cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States. Screening tests can help prevent colorectal cancer, but many people
have not been screened. The United States Preventive Services Task Force
recommendsexternal icon that all adults who are 50 to 75 years old be screened
for colorectal cancer.

This study compared how many people were screened for colorectal cancer as
recommended in different states in 2012 and 2016.

## How the Study Worked

CDC scientists used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). The BRFSS is a random telephone survey that asks people across the
United States questions about their health, behaviors, and health care.

## What the Study Found

The percentage of adults in the United States who are 50 to 75 years old who
said they were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Went up nationwide from about 66% in 2012 to 67% in 2016.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Ranged from about 59% in New Mexico to 76% in Maine in 2016.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Went up by 1% or more between 2012 and 2016 in 37 states, with the biggest gains in Arkansas (9%) and Hawaii (8%).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Went down between 2012 and 2016 in six states (Georgia, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware).

## What This Means

Nationwide, the percentage of adults who were up-to-date with colorectal
cancer screening went up by nearly 2% between 2012 and 2016, meaning that 5
million more people were screened. But about one-third of adults have not been
screened as recommended.

People may not get screened for colorectal cancer because--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * They don't have a doctor they see regularly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * They don't know they should get screened.

## Call to Action

Public health agencies can educate people about the need for colorectal cancer
screening, and help them get screened. For example, CDC's Colorectal Cancer
Control Program funds 23 states, 6 universities, and a tribe to work with
health clinics to increase colorectal cancer screening.

Screening tests can help prevent colorectal cancer or find it early, when
treatment works best. There are several recommended screening tests. If you're
50 years old or older, get screened. If you're younger than 50, but think you
may have an increased risk of getting colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor
about getting screened.
