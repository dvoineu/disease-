#  Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

Also called: Cutis elastica, EDS

## Summary

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that weaken
connective tissues. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin, bones,
blood vessels, and other organs.

EDS usually affects your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Symptoms include

    * Loose joints 
    * Fragile, small blood vessels 
    * Abnormal scar formation and wound healing 
    * Soft, velvety, stretchy skin that bruises easily 

There are several types of EDS. They can range from mild to life-threatening.
About 1 in 5,000 people has EDS. There is no cure. Treatment involves managing
symptoms, often with medicines and physical therapy. It also includes learning
how to protect your joints and prevent injuries.
