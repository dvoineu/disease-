## Summary

Hypoglycemia means low blood glucose, or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose
to have enough energy. After you eat, your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat
more sugar than your body needs, your muscles, and liver store the extra. When
your blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone tells your liver to release
glucose.

In most people, this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't, you have hypoglycemia,
and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include

  * Hunger
  * Shakiness
  * Dizziness
  * Confusion
  * Difficulty speaking
  * Feeling anxious or weak

In people with diabetes, hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes
medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it
happens often, your health care provider may need to change your treatment
plan.

You can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes. Causes include
certain medicines or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, and tumors.
Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why
you have low blood sugar.
