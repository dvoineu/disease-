## Summary

Your salivary glands make saliva - sometimes called spit - and empty it into
your mouth through openings called ducts. Saliva makes your food moist, which
helps you chew and swallow. It helps you digest your food. It also cleans your
mouth and contains antibodies that can kill germs.

Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. It is rare. It may
not cause any symptoms, or you could notice

    * A lump in your ear, cheek, jaw, lip, or inside the mouth
    * Fluid draining from your ear
    * Trouble swallowing or opening the mouth widely
    * Numbness, weakness, or pain in your face

Doctors diagnose salivary gland cancer using a physical exam, imaging tests,
and a biopsy. Treatment can include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or
chemotherapy.
