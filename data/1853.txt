Quitting smoking is one of the most important things individuals can do to
protect their health. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable
disease, disability, and death in the United States, and the changing
landscape of tobacco use demands innovation to expand and improve efforts to
help people quit.

To bring attention to the critical role of cessation as part of a
comprehensive tobacco prevention and control approach, OSH has declared 2019
its _Year of Cessation_.
