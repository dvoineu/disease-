## Environmental Health

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community you live in, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
negatively affected.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting state and
city public health programs, educating communities, and advancing scientific
knowledge. We help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a
healthy environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness
caused by environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might
be exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing health care costs. We strive to
maximize the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

## Environmental Health Laboratory

**CDC 's Environmental Health Laboratory provides unique laboratory science
that improves the detection, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases
resulting from exposure to environmental chemicals and selected other diseases
that require advanced laboratory measurement for accurate diagnosis.**
