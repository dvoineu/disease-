## Summary

Your pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. The
pituitary is the "master control gland" \- it makes hormones that affect
growth and the functions of other glands in the body.

With pituitary disorders, you often have too much or too little of one of your
hormones. Injuries can cause pituitary disorders, but the most common cause is
a pituitary tumor.
