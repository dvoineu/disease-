## Summary

Cold weather can affect your body in different ways. You can get frostbite,
which is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. Your body can also
lose heat faster than you can produce it. That can cause hypothermia, or
abnormally low body temperature. It can make you sleepy, confused, and clumsy.
Because it happens gradually and affects your thinking, you may not realize
you need help. That makes it especially dangerous. A body temperature below
95Â° F is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated promptly.

Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You
can also get it from being cold and wet, or under cold water for too long.
Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping
in a cold room.
