## Summary

Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.
For blood to clot, your body needs cells called platelets and proteins known
as clotting factors. If you have a bleeding disorder, you either do not have
enough platelets or clotting factors or they don't work the way they should.

Bleeding disorders can be the result of other diseases, such as severe liver
disease or a lack of vitamin K. They can also be inherited. Hemophilia is an
inherited bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders can also be a side effect of
medicines such as blood thinners.

Various blood tests can check for a bleeding disorder. You will also have a
physical exam and history. Treatments depend on the cause. They may include
medicines and transfusions of blood, platelets, or clotting factor.
