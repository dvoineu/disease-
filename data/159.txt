#  Chemical Emergencies

## Summary

When a hazardous chemical has been released, it may harm people's health.
Chemical releases can be unintentional, as in the case of an industrial
accident. They could also be planned, as in the case of a terrorist attack
with a chemical weapon.

Some hazardous chemicals have been developed by military organizations for use
in warfare. Examples are nerve agents such as sarin and VX. Many hazardous
chemicals are used in industry - for example, chlorine, ammonia, and benzene.
Some can be made from everyday items such as household cleaners.

Although there are no guarantees of safety during a chemical emergency, you
can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being
prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a
disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to
cope.
