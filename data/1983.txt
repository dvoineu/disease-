## Summary

When will my baby take his first step or say her first word? During their
first year, babies start to develop skills they will use for the rest of their
lives. The normal growth of babies can be broken down into the following
areas:

    * Gross motor - controlling the head, sitting, crawling, maybe even starting to walk
    * Fine motor - holding a spoon, picking up a piece of cereal between thumb and finger
    * Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching and smelling
    * Language - starting to make sounds, learning some words, understanding what people say 
    * Social - the ability to play with family members and other children

Babies do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is
considered "normal." Your baby may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind
in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your baby's
health care provider.
