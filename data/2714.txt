Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection.

## Causes

LGV is a long-term (chronic) infection of the lymphatic system. It is caused
by any of three different types (serovars) of the bacteria _Chlamydia
trachomatis_. The bacteria are spread by sexual contact. The infection is not
caused by the same bacteria that cause genital chlamydia.

LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America.

LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is being HIV-
positive.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of LGV can begin a few days to a month after coming in contact with
the bacteria. Symptoms include:

    * Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin
    * Painful bowel movements (tenesmus)
    * Small painless sore on the male genitals or in the female genital tract
    * Swelling and redness of the skin in the groin area
    * Swelling of the labia (in women)
    * Swollen groin lymph nodes on one or both sides; it may also affect lymph nodes around the rectum in people who have anal intercourse
    * Blood or pus from the rectum (blood in the stools)

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you. You will be asked about your
medical and sexual history. Tell your provider if you had sexual contact with
someone you think has had symptoms of LGV.

A physical exam may show:

    * An oozing, abnormal connection (fistula) in the rectal area
    * A sore on the genitals
    * Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin
    * Swelling of the vulva or labia in women
    * Swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymphadenopathy) 

Tests may include:

    * Biopsy of the lymph node
    * Blood test for the bacteria that causes LGV
    * Laboratory test to detect chlamydia 

## Treatment

LGV is treated with antibiotics,Â including doxycycline and erythromycin.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

With treatment, the outlook is good and complete recovery can be expected.

## Possible Complications

Health problems that may result from LGV infection include:

    * Abnormal connections between the rectum and vagina (fistula)
    * Brain inflammation (encephalitis \- very rare)
    * Infections in the joints, eyes, heart, or liver
    * Long-term inflammation and swelling of the genitals
    * Scarring and narrowing of the rectum

Complications can occur many years after you are first infected.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if:

    * You have been in contact with someone who may haveÂ a sexually transmitted infection, including LGV
    * You develop symptoms of LGV

## Prevention

Not having any sexual activity is the only way to prevent a sexually
transmitted infection. Safer sex behaviors may reduce the risk.

The proper use of condoms, either the male or female type, greatly decreases
the risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection. You need to wear the
condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity.

## Alternative Names

LGV; Lymphogranuloma inguinale; Lymphopathia venereum
