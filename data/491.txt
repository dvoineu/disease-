## Summary

If you have a swallowing disorder, you may have difficulty or pain when
swallowing. Some people cannot swallow at all. Others may have trouble
swallowing liquids, foods, or saliva. This makes it hard to eat. Often, it can
be difficult to take in enough calories and fluids to nourish your body.

Anyone can have a swallowing disorder, but it is more common in older adults.
It often happens because of other conditions, including

    * Nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and cerebral palsy
    * Problems with your esophagus, including GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
    * Stroke
    * Head or spinal cord  injury
    * Cancer of the head, neck, or esophagus

Medicines can help some people, while others may need surgery. Swallowing
treatment with a speech-language pathologist can help. You may find it helpful
to change your diet or hold your head or neck in a certain way when you eat.
In very serious cases, people may need feeding tubes.
