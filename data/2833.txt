Polycythemia can occur when there are too many red blood cells (RBCs) in an
infant's blood.

## Causes

The percentage of RBCs in the infant's blood is called the "hematocrit." When
this is greater than 65%, polycythemia is present.

Polycythemia can result from conditions that develop before birth. These may
include:

    * Delay in clamping the umbilical cord
    * Diabetes in the baby's birth mother
    * Inherited diseases and genetic problems
    * Too little oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia)
    * Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other) 

The extra RBCs can slow or block the flow of blood in the smallest blood
vessels. This is called hyperviscosity. This may lead to tissue death from
lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the
kidneys, lungs, and brain.

## Symptoms

Symptoms may include:

    * Extreme sleepiness
    * Feeding problems
    * Seizures

## Exams and Tests

There may be signs of breathing problems, kidney failure, low blood sugar, or
newborn jaundice.

If the baby has symptoms of hyperviscosity, a blood test to count the number
of RBCs will be done. This test is called a hematocrit.

Other tests may include:

    * Blood gases to check oxygen level in the blood
    * Blood sugar (glucose) to check for low blood sugar
    * Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a substance that forms when protein breaks down
    * Creatinine
    * Urinalysis
    * Bilirubin 

## Treatment

The baby will be monitored for complications of hyperviscosity. Fluids may be
given through the vein. A partial volume exchange transfusion is sometimes
still done in some cases. However, there is little evidence that this is
effective. It is most important to treat the underlying cause of the
polycythemia.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook is good for infants with mild hyperviscosity. Good results are
also possible in infants who receive treatment for severe hyperviscosity. The
outlook will depend largely on the reason for the condition.

Some children may have mild developmental changes. Parents should contact
their health care provider if they think their child shows signs of delayed
development.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Death of intestinal tissue (necrotizing enterocolitis)
    * Decreased fine motor control
    * Kidney failure
    * Seizures
    * Strokes

## Alternative Names

Neonatal polycythemia; Hyperviscosity - newborn
