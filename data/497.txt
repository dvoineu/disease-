## Summary

Vasectomy is a type of surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a
woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.

A vasectomy works by cutting the tubes that carry the sperm out of the
testicles. The surgery usually takes no more than 30 minutes. Most men go home
the same day. In most cases, recovery takes less than a week. Having a
vasectomy does not affect your sex life.

It takes about three months before it is effective. Your doctor will test your
semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it.

Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed, but not always. Having a vasectomy does
not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS. Men who
have had a vasectomy should still practice safe sex to avoid STDs.
