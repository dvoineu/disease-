## Summary

In the U.S., the government's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve
any drug before it can be sold. This is true whether it's a prescription or an
over-the-counter drug. The FDA evaluates the safety of a drug by looking at

  * Side effects
  * How it's manufactured
  * Results of animal testing and clinical trials

The FDA also monitors a drug's safety after approval.

For you, drug safety means buying online from only legitimate pharmacies and
taking your medicines correctly.
