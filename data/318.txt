## Summary

Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles,
arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are many different pain medicines,
and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to
certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different
response to a pain reliever.

Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are
two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen
(Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.

If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something
stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The
most powerful pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but they
can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction.
Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.

There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just
one part of a pain treatment plan.
