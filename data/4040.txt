Numerator definition | _Numerator_ : Number of children aged 0-17 years with
current asthma with not-well-controlled/very-poorly-controlled asthma (versus
well controlled asthma)Survey questions for individual components of asthma
control (Source: Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS)):

_1\. Daytime symptoms:_  
_" During the past 30 days, on how many days did [child's name] have any
symptoms of asthma?"_

_2\. Nighttime awakenings:_  
_" During the past 30 days, on how many days did symptoms of asthma make it
difficult for [him/her] to stay asleep?"_

_3\. Interference with normal activity:_  
_" During just the past 30 days, would you say [child's name] limited
[his/her] usual activities due to asthma not at all, a little, a moderate
amount, or a lot?"_ Note: the recall period for this question changed in the
ACBS from "12 months" to "30 days" in 2012.

1Identify those medications that are inhaled SABA. This determination needs
annual update, since new inhaled medications may be become available. INH_MEDS
series is a list of medications which the ACBS interviewer uses to identify up
to 8 medications reported by the respondent. This list should be checked in
the ACBS child questionnaire each year for updates. In 2012, it included the
following SABA medications: albuterol (Ventolin, Proair HFA, Proventil),
bitolterol (Tornalate), Combivent, levalbuterol (Xopenex), metaproterenol
(Alupent), pirbuterol (Maxair), salbutamol (albuterol), and terbutaline
(Brethaire).

Category of asthma control was based on the most impaired level across all
four components (symptoms, nighttime awakenings, interference with activity,
and Short-acting beta agonist use). Categorizing levels of control therefore
requires assessing all 4 components for each individual child (see Technical
Appendix):

have ever been diagnosed with asthma. Estimates from this survey are typically
reported as at-risk rates (rates of events among persons who currently have
asthma). However, population-based rates may also convey useful information
about the burden of asthma, but does not take into account differences in
asthma prevalence between demographic groups.

Background | Monitoring asthma control helps determine the effectiveness of
current treatment in limiting frequency and intensity of symptoms and
functional limitations. Asthma control is measured by determining the most
severe levels of impairment (frequency of daytime symptoms, nighttime
awakenings, interference with normal activity, SABA use, and lung function)
and risk (frequency of use of oral steroids). Level of asthma control is a
function of underlying severity, responsiveness to treatment and the adequacy
of asthma management(2).  
Significance to disparities | Uncontrolled asthma is associated with an
increased risk of adverse asthma outcomes, significantly decreased quality of
life and increased health care use.(2,3) Non-Hispanic black children are more
likely that non-Hispanic white children to have very poorly controlled
asthma(3).  
Data considerations | The measure available from national survey questionnaire
items is a compilation of 4 components and captures a subset of 2007 NAEPP
guideline impairment criteria. The lung function impairment and risk criteria
are not captured in the survey-based measurement(2).  
The component of control considering use of short-acting beta agonists is
based only on inhaler use and does not include use of syrups, pills or
nebulizer. Therefore, prevalence of poor asthma control may be underestimated
for younger children who may be more likely to use nebulizers.

Background | Among adults, those with self-reported current asthma were
significantly more likely to report having fair or poor health compared to
those who formerly or never had asthma. These differences persisted after
adjustment for sociodemographic factors(1). Similarly, among adolescents,
those with symptomatic asthma had a higher percentage reporting fair or poor
health compared to adolescents with asthma without symptoms, and those without
asthma(2).  
Significance to disparities | Those with symptomatic asthma are more likely to
have lower quality of life, which is reflected in self-reported health
status(2). To the extent that symptoms and poor asthma control are higher
among minority and poor children, this group may more likely to have overall
impacts of asthma on self-reported health status.  
Data considerations | Self- or proxy-reported perceived health status can be
affected by numerous considerations other than actual health status (e.g., by
the health or mental status of the proxy reporter)  
Data resources |  
Related data standards | Health status may be related to frequency and
severity asthma symptoms:

_* This outcome is primarily of interest among persons with asthma
--comparisons between groups should account for differences in asthma
prevalence, and thus be made using at-risk rates._  
This indicator can also be used to estimate asthma control based on NAEPP
criteria, but adapted for population-based surveys (1):  
Percent of children aged 0-17 years with current asthma who had daytime
symptoms of asthma that meet the EPR-3 criteria for Not Well- Controlled/Very
Poorly Controlled asthma:  
Age 0-4: 3 or more days per week or multiple times on ≤2 days per week  
Age 5-11: 3 or more days per week or multiple times on ≤2 days per week  
Age 12-17: 3 or more days per week or throughout the day

Background | Daytime asthma symptoms, which can include wheezing, shortness of
breath, chest tightness and coughing, are one of the key indicators of asthma
control, along with nighttime awakenings, activity limitations and lung
function. According to the NAEPP guidelines for asthma diagnosis and
management, asthma is considered well controlled only if daytime symptoms
occur less than or equal to 2 days per week(1).  
Significance to disparities | Population-based asthma attack prevalence is
higher for black children than white children; however, when asthma prevalence
is taken into account (i.e., at-risk rates) asthma attack rates are the same
for white children compared to black children. Nonetheless, black children are
still more likely than white children to experience severe outcomes (e.g.,
asthma hospitalizations)(2).  
Data considerations | Reporting of symptoms in the past 30 days is subject to
recall bias. In addition, estimates of daytime symptom frequency for children
are based on report of parent/guardian and so may be under- or over-reported.

Related data standards | Daytime symptoms are one criteria used to determine
asthma control:

_* This outcome is primarily of interest among persons with asthma
--comparisons between groups should account for differences in asthma
prevalence, and thus be made using at-risk rates._  
This indicator can also be used to estimate asthma control based on National
Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) criteria, but adapted for
population-based surveys (1):  
Percent of children aged 0-17 years with current asthma who had nighttime
symptoms of asthma that meet the EPR-3 criteria for Not Well- Controlled/Very
Poorly Controlled asthma:  
Age 0-4: more than 1 time per month  
Age 5-11: 2 or more times per month  
Age 12-17: 1 or more times per week

Background | Nighttime awakenings are one of the key indicators of asthma
control, along with daytime symptoms, activity limitations and lung function.
According to the NAEPP guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, asthma
is considered well controlled only if nighttime awakenings occur less than 2
times per month for children age 0-11 and less than 3 times per month for
persons 12 and older(1). Nighttime awakenings due to asthma have been shown to
impact school attendance, academic performance and parents' work
attendance(2).  
Significance to disparities | Population-based asthma attack prevalence is
higher for black children than white children; however, when asthma prevalence
is taken into account (i.e., at-risk rates) asthma attack rates are the same
for white children compared to black children. Nevertheless, black children
are still more likely than white children to experience severe outcomes (e.g.,
asthma hospitalizations)(3).  
Data considerations | Reporting of symptoms in the past 30 days is subject to
recall bias. In addition, estimates of the frequency of nighttime awakenings
for children are based on report of parent/guardian and so may be under- or
over-reported.

prevalence, and thus be made using at-risk rates._  
This indicator can also be used to estimate asthma control based on National
Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) criteria, but adapted for
population-based surveys (1):

Background | Interference with normal activity is one of measure of asthma
control, along with daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings and lung function.
According to the NAEPP guidelines, asthma is considered well controlled only
if there is no interference with normal activity(1).

From CDC Chronic Disease Indicator: Experiencing activity limitations because
of poor physical or mental health interferes with social functioning, is
associated with health behavior, and is an indicator of population
productivity(2).  
  
Significance to disparities |  
Data considerations | Reporting of activity limitations in the past 30 days
may be subject to recall bias. In addition, estimates of the degree of
activity limitations for children are based on report of parent/guardian and
so may be under- or over- reported.

1 Identify those medications that are inhaled SABA. This determination needs
annual update, since new inhaled medications may be become available. INH_MEDS
series is a list of medications which the interviewer uses to identify up to 8
medications reported by the respondent. This list should be checked in the
ACBS child questionnaire each year for updates. In 2012, it included the
following SABA medications: albuterol (Ventolin, Proair HFA, Proventil),
bitolterol (Tornalate), Combivent, levalbuterol (Xopenex), metaproterenol
(Alupent), pirbuterol (Maxair), salbutamol (albuterol), and terbutaline
(Brethaire).

Background | SABAs are used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm and to
provide quick relief of acute asthma symptoms, but do not provide long-term
control of asthma. SABAs are bronchodilators and work by relaxing airway
muscles. According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
guidelines, use of SABAs more than 2 days a week is an indicator of inadequate
asthma control and the need to start or increase long-term controller
medications(1).  
Significance to disparities | Minority children are less likely than white
children to be prescribed or take recommended treatments to control their
asthma, and are less likely to attend outpatient appointments(2).  
Data considerations | Reporting of medication use in the past 30 days is
subject to recall bias. This indicator only includes SABA medications taken by
inhaler since the frequency of SABAs taken in some other form (including
nebulizer) is not captured on the ACBS. Therefore, control assessed by SABA
use may be an underestimate SABA use among younger children who are more
likely to use nebulizers.
