## Summary

Your back is made of bones, muscles, and other tissues extending from your
neck to your pelvis. Back injuries can result from sports injuries, work
around the house or in the garden, or a sudden jolt such as a car accident.
The lower back is the most common site of back injuries and back pain. Common
back injuries include

  * Sprains and strains
  * Herniated disks
  * Fractured (broken) vertebrae

These injuries can cause pain and limit your movement. Treatments vary but
might include medicines, icing, bed rest, physical therapy, or surgery. You
might be able to prevent some back injuries by maintaining a healthy weight,
lifting objects with your legs, and using lower-back support when you sit.
