## Summary

Marfan syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue. Connective
tissues are proteins that support skin, bones, blood vessels, and other
organs. One of these proteins is fibrillin. A problem with the fibrillin gene
causes Marfan syndrome.

Marfan syndrome can be mild to severe, and the symptoms can vary. People with
Marfan syndrome are often very tall, thin, and loose jointed. Most people with
Marfan syndrome have heart and blood vessel problems, such as a weakness in
the aorta or heart valves that leak. They may also have problems with their
bones, eyes, skin, nervous system, and lungs.

There is no specific test for Marfan syndrome. Your doctor may use your
medical history, family history, and a physical exam to diagnose it. Marfan
syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications.
Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies.
