Youth Violence is the intentional use of physical force or power to threaten
or harm others by young people ages 10-24. Examples include bullying,
fighting, threats with weapons, and gang-related violence. Youth violence is
an adverse childhood experience (ACE). It is linked to other forms of violence
including teen dating violence, suicide, and adult intimate partner violence.
