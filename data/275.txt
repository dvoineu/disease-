## Summary

A bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your
digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and
anus. Another name for stool is feces. It is made of what is left after your
digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and
fluids from what you eat and drink.

Sometimes a bowel movement isn't normal. Diarrhea happens when stool passes
through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes
through the large intestine too slowly. Bowel incontinence is a problem
controlling your bowel movements. Other abnormalities with bowel movements may
be a sign of a digestive problem.
