## Summary

Hemorrhoids are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower rectum. They
are either inside the anus or under the skin around the anus. They often
result from straining to have a bowel movement. Other factors include
pregnancy, aging and chronic constipation or diarrhea.

Hemorrhoids are very common in both men and women. About half of all people
have hemorrhoids by age 50. The most common symptom of hemorrhoids inside the
anus is bright red blood covering the stool, on toilet paper or in the toilet
bowl. Symptoms usually go away within a few days.

If you have rectal bleeding you should see a doctor. You need to make sure
bleeding is not from a more serious condition such as colorectal or anal
cancer. Treatment may include warm baths and a cream or other medicine. If you
have large hemorrhoids, you may need surgery and other treatments.
