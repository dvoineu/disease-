## Summary

Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing cancers. They usually start in the
lining of the digestive tract or in the lungs. They grow slowly and don't
produce symptoms in the early stages. As a result, the average age of people
diagnosed with digestive or lung carcinoids is about 60.

In later stages the tumors sometimes produce hormones that can cause carcinoid
syndrome. The syndrome causes flushing of the face and upper chest, diarrhea,
and trouble breathing.

Surgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors. If they haven't spread to
other parts of the body, surgery can cure the cancer.
