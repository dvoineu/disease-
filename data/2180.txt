## Summary

Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a
contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy, and
the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.

Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their
employers. In most cases, the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance
through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with
health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at
reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.

People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health
insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands
health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.
