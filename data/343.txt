## Summary

Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar or glucose. Glucose comes from the foods
you eat. Insulin is a hormone that moves glucose into your cells to give them
energy. Hyperglycemia happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or
can't use it the right way.

People with diabetes can get hyperglycemia from not eating the right foods or
not taking medicines correctly. Other problems that can raise blood sugar
include infections, certain medicines, hormone imbalances, or severe
illnesses.
