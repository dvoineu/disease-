## Summary

Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions
inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity.

Before the test, you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may
get it as an injection. Sometimes you swallow it or inhale it. Then you lie
still on a table while the camera makes images. Most scans take 20 to 45
minutes.

Nuclear scans can help doctors diagnose many conditions, including cancers,
injuries, and infections. They can also show how organs like your heart and
lungs are working.
