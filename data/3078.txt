# Strategic National Stockpile

Main Content

![Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic](/about/sns/PublishingImages/SNS-
banner2.jpg)  

The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local
supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products
stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care
contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the
immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately
available.
