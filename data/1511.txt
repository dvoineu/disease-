A ventricular septal defect (pronounced ven*tric*u*lar sep*tal de*fect) (VSD)
is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum)
that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. This wall
also is called the ventricular septum.

### What is a Ventricular Septal Defect

A ventricular septal defect happens during pregnancy if the wall that forms
between the two ventricles does not fully develop, leaving a hole. A
ventricular septal defect is one type of congenital heart defect. Congenital
means present at birth.

In a baby without a congenital heart defect, the right side of the heart pumps
oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs, and the left side of the heart
pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.

In babies with a ventricular septal defect, blood often flows from the left
ventricle through the ventricular septal defect to the right ventricle and
into the lungs. This extra blood being pumped into the lungs forces the heart
and lungs to work harder. Over time, if not repaired, this defect can increase
the risk for other complications, including heart failure, high blood pressure
in the lungs (called pulmonary hypertension), irregular heart rhythms (called
arrhythmia), or stroke.

An infant with a ventricular septal defect can have one or more holes in
different places of the septum. There are several names for these holes. Some
common locations and names are (see figure):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. **Conoventricular Ventricular Septal Defect  
**In general, this is a hole where portions of the ventricular septum should
meet just below the _pulmonary_ and _aortic valves_.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. **Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect  
**This is a hole in the upper section of the ventricular septum.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. **Inlet Ventricular Septal Defect  
**This is a hole in the septum near to where the blood enters the ventricles
through the tricuspid and mitral valves. This type of ventricular septal
defect also might be part of another heart defect called an atrioventricular
septal defect (AVSD).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. **Muscular Ventricular Septal Defect  
**This is a hole in the lower, muscular part of the ventricular septum and is
the most common type of ventricular septal defect.

### Occurrence

In a study in Atlanta, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimated that 42 of every 10,000 babies born had a ventricular septal
defect.1 This means about 16,800 babies are born each year in the United
States with a ventricular septal defect. In other words, about 1 in every 240
babies born in the United States each year are born with a ventricular septal
defect.

### Causes and Risk Factors

The causes of heart defects (such as a ventricular septal defect) among most
babies are unknown. Some babies have heart defects because of changes in their
_genes_ or _chromosomes_. Heart defects also are thought to be caused by a
combination of genes and other risk factors, such as the things the mother
comes in contact with in the environment or what the mother eats or drinks or
the medicines the mother uses.

### Diagnosis

A ventricular septal defect usually is diagnosed after a baby is born.

The size of the ventricular septal defect will influence what symptoms, if
any, are present, and whether a doctor hears a heart murmur during a physical
examination. Signs of a ventricular septal defect might be present at birth or
might not appear until well after birth. If the hole is small, it usually will
close on its own and the baby might not show any signs of the defect. However,
if the hole is large, the baby might have symptoms, including:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Shortness of breath,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Fast or heavy breathing,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Sweating,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Tiredness while feeding, or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Poor weight gain.

During a physical examination the doctor might hear a distinct whooshing
sound, called a heart murmur. If the doctor hears a heart murmur or other
signs are present, the doctor can request one or more tests to confirm the
diagnosis. The most common test is an _echocardiogram_, which is an
_ultrasound_ of the heart that can show problems with the structure of the
heart, show how large the hole is, and show how much blood is flowing through
the hole.

### Treatments

Treatments for a ventricular septal defect depend on the size of the hole and
the problems it might cause. Many ventricular septal defects are small and
close on their own; if the hole is small and not causing any symptoms, the
doctor will check the infant regularly to ensure there are no signs of heart
failure and that the hole closes on its own. If the hole does not close on its
own or if it is large, further actions might need to be taken.

Depending on the size of the hole, symptoms, and general health of the child,
the doctor might recommend either _cardiac catheterization_ or _open-heart
surgery_ to close the hole and restore normal blood flow. After surgery, the
doctor will set up regular follow-up visits to make sure that the ventricular
septal defect remains closed. Most children who have a ventricular septal
defect that closes (either on its own or with surgery) live healthy lives.

##### Medicines

Some children will need medicines to help strengthen the heart muscle, lower
their blood pressure, and help the body get rid of extra fluid.

##### Nutrition

Some babies with a ventricular septal defect become tired while feeding and do
not eat enough to gain weight. To make sure babies have a healthy weight gain,
a special high-calorie formula might be prescribed. Some babies become
extremely tired while feeding and might need to be fed through a _feeding
tube_.
