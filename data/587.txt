## Summary

The uterus, or womb, is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.
The first sign of a problem with the uterus may be bleeding between periods or
after sex. Causes can include hormones, thyroid problems, fibroids, polyps,
cancer, infection, or pregnancy.

Treatment depends on the cause. Sometimes birth control pills treat hormonal
imbalances. If a thyroid problem is the cause, treating it may also stop the
bleeding. If you have cancer or hyperplasia, an overgrowth of normal cells in
the uterus, you may need surgery.

With two other uterine problems, tissue that normally lines the uterus grows
where it is not supposed to. In endometriosis, it grows outside the uterus. In
adenomyosis, it grows in the uterus's outside walls. Pain medicine may help.
Other treatments include hormones and surgery.
