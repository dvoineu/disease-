## Summary

Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food
you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in
your digestive system break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your
body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the
energy in your body tissues, such as your liver, muscles, and body fat.

A metabolic disorder occurs when abnormal chemical reactions in your body
disrupt this process. When this happens, you might have too much of some
substances or too little of other ones that you need to stay healthy. There
are different groups of disorders. Some affect the breakdown of amino acids,
carbohydrates, or lipids. Another group, mitochondrial diseases, affects the
parts of the cells that produce the energy.

You can develop a metabolic disorder when some organs, such as your liver or
pancreas, become diseased or do not function normally. Diabetes is an example.
