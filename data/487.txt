## Summary

Your small intestine is the longest part of your digestive system - about
twenty feet long! It connects your stomach to your large intestine (or colon)
and folds many times to fit inside your abdomen. Your small intestine does
most of the digesting of the foods you eat. It has three areas called the
duodenum, the ileum, and the jejunum.

Problems with the small intestine can include:

    * Bleeding
    * Celiac disease
    * Crohn's disease
    * Infections
    * Intestinal cancer
    * Intestinal obstruction
    * Irritable bowel syndrome
    * Ulcers, such as peptic ulcer

Treatment of disorders of the small intestine depends on the cause.
