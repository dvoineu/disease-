## Summary

Pressure sores are areas of damaged skin caused by staying in one position for
too long. They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin, such as
your ankles, back, elbows, heels and hips. You are at risk if you are
bedridden, use a wheelchair, or are unable to change your position. Pressure
sores can cause serious infections, some of which are life-threatening. They
can be a problem for people in nursing homes.

You can prevent the sores by

  * Keeping skin clean and dry
  * Changing position every two hours
  * Using pillows and products that relieve pressure

Pressure sores have a variety of treatments. Advanced sores are slow to heal,
so early treatment is best.
