_The following guidance is current for the 2019-2020 influenza season. Please
seeRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -
United States, 2019-20 __  for the latest information regarding recommended
influenza vaccines. Please see __Antiviral Drugs: Information for Health Care
Professionals_ _for the current summary of recommendations for clinical
practice regarding the use of influenza antiviral medications._

_This guidance supersedes previous CDC guidance for both seasonal influenza
and the Interim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza
in Healthcare Settings, which was written to apply uniquely to the special
circumstances of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as they existed in October 2009. As
stated in that document, CDC planned to update the guidance as new information
became available. In particular, one major change from the spring and fall of
2009 is the widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine for the
2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Components of this vaccine have been included in
the 2010-2011 trivalent seasonal vaccine. Second, the overall risk of
hospitalization and death among people infected with this strain was uncertain
in spring and fall of 2009, but is now known to be substantially lower than
pre-pandemic assumptions. In addition, more information has been recently
published or presented indicating that face mask use and hand hygiene reduce
the risk of influenza infection in health care and household settings. The
current circumstances and new information justify an update of the
recommendations._

_This updated guidance continues to emphasize the importance of a
comprehensive influenza prevention strategy that can be applied across the
entire spectrum of healthcare settings. CDC will continue to evaluate new
information as it becomes available and will update or expand this guidance as
needed. Additional information oninfluenza prevention, treatment, and control
can be found on Seasonal Influenza (Flu) web site._

### Definition of Healthcare Settings

For the purposes of this guidance, healthcare settings include, but are not
limited to, acute-care hospitals; long-term care facilities, such as nursing
homes and skilled nursing facilities; physicians' offices; urgent-care
centers, outpatient clinics; and home healthcare. This guidance is not
intended to apply to other settings whose primary purpose is not healthcare,
such as schools or worksites, because many of the aspects of the populations
and feasible countermeasures will differ substantially across settings.
However, elements of this guidance may be applicable to specific sites within
non-healthcare settings where care is routinely delivered (e.g. a medical
clinic embedded within a workplace or school).

### Definition of Healthcare Personnel

For the purposes of this guidance, the 2008 Department of Health and Human
Services definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP)external icon will be used.
Specifically, HCP refers to all persons, paid and unpaid, working in
healthcare settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or to
infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies
and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. HCP
include, but are not limited to, physicians, nurses, nursing assistants,
therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental
personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and
trainees, contractual personnel, home healthcare personnel, and persons not
directly involved in patient care (e.g., clerical, dietary, house-keeping,
laundry, security, maintenance, billing, chaplains, and volunteers) but
potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from
HCP and patients. This guidance is not intended to apply to persons outside of
healthcare settings for reasons discussed in the previous section.

### Introduction

Influenza is primarily a community-based infection that is transmitted in
households and community settings. Each year, 5% to 20% of U.S. residents
acquire an influenza virus infection, and many will seek medical care in
ambulatory healthcare settings (e.g., pediatricians' offices, urgent-care
clinics). In addition, more than 200,000 persons, on average, are hospitalized
each year for influenza-related complications. Healthcare-associated influenza
infections can occur in any healthcare setting and are most common when
influenza is also circulating in the community. Therefore, the influenza
prevention measures outlined in this guidance should be implemented in all
healthcare settings. Supplemental measures may need to be implemented during
influenza season if outbreaks of healthcare-associated influenza occur within
certain facilities, such as long-term care facilities and hospitals [refs:
Infection Control Measures for Preventing and Controlling Influenza
Transmission in Long-Term Care Facilities].

### Influenza Modes of Transmission

Traditionally, influenza viruses have been thought to spread from person to
person primarily through large-particle respiratory droplet transmission
(e.g., when an infected person coughs or sneezes near a susceptible person).
Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source
and recipient persons, because droplets generally travel only short distances
(approximately 6 feet or less) through the air. Indirect contact transmission
via hand transfer of influenza virus from virus-contaminated surfaces or
objects to mucosal surfaces of the face (e.g., nose, mouth) may also occur.
Airborne transmission via small particle aerosols in the vicinity of the
infectious individual may also occur; however, the relative contribution of
the different modes of influenza transmission is unclear. Airborne
transmission over longer distances, such as from one patient room to another
has not been documented and is thought not to occur. All respiratory
secretions and bodily fluids, including diarrheal stools, of patients with
influenza are considered to be potentially infectious; however, the risk may
vary by strain. Detection of influenza virus in blood or stool in influenza
infected patients is very uncommon.

### Fundamental Elements to Prevent Influenza Transmission

Preventing transmission of influenza virus and other infectious agents within
healthcare settings requires a multi-faceted approach. Spread of influenza
virus can occur among patients, HCP, and visitors; in addition, HCP may
acquire influenza from persons in their household or community. The core
prevention strategies include:

Successful implementation of many, if not all, of these strategies is
dependent on the presence of clear administrative policies and organizational
leadership that promote and facilitate adherence to these recommendations
among the various people within the healthcare setting, including patients,
visitors, and HCP. These administrative measures are included within each
recommendation where appropriate. Furthermore, this guidance should be
implemented in the context of a comprehensive infection prevention program to
prevent transmission of all infectious agents among patients and HCP.

### Recommendations

**1\. Promote and administer seasonal influenza vaccine**

Annual vaccination is the most important measure to prevent seasonal influenza
infection. Achieving high influenza vaccination rates of HCP and patients is a
critical step in preventing healthcare transmission of influenza from HCP to
patients and from patients to HCP. According to current national guidelines,
unless contraindicated, vaccinate all people aged 6 months and older,
including HCP, patients and residents of long-term care facilities [refs:
Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines and Seasonal Influenza
Vaccination Resources for Health Professionals].

Systematic strategies employed by some institutions to improve HCP vaccination
rates have included providing incentives, providing vaccine at no cost to HCP,
improving access (e.g., offering vaccination at work and during work hours),
requiring personnel to sign declination forms to acknowledge that they have
been educated about the benefits and risks of vaccination, and mandating
influenza vaccination for all HCP without contraindication. Many of these
approaches have been shown to increase vaccination rates; tracking influenza
vaccination coverage among HCP can be an important component of a systematic
approach to protecting patients and HCP. Regardless of the strategy used,
strong organizational leadership and an infrastructure for clear and timely
communication and education, and for program implementation, have been common
elements in successful programs. More information on different HCP vaccination
strategies can be found in the Appendix: Influenza Vaccination Strategies.

**2\. Take Steps to Minimize Potential Exposures**

A range of administrative policies and practices can be used to minimize
influenza exposures before arrival, upon arrival, and throughout the duration
of the visit to the healthcare setting. Measures include screening and triage
of symptomatic patients and implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough
etiquette. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are measures designed to
minimize potential exposures of all respiratory pathogens, including influenza
virus, in healthcare settings and should be adhered to by everyone - patients,
visitors, and HCP - upon entry and continued for the entire duration of stay
in healthcare settings.

Furthermore, once infected, these patients can have prolonged viral shedding despite antiviral treatment and expose other patients to influenza virus infection. Prolonged shedding also increases the chance of developing and spreading antiviral-resistant influenza strains; clusters of influenza antiviral resistance cases have been found among severely immunocompromised persons exposed to a common source or healthcare setting.

Thus, it can be very difficult to distinguish influenza from many other causes, especially early in a person's illness. HCP with fever alone should follow workplace policy for HCP with fever until a more specific cause of fever is identified or until fever resolves.

HCP who develop acute respiratory symptoms without fever may still have
influenza infection and should be:

If symptoms such as cough and sneezing are still present, HCP should wear a facemask during patient care activities. The importance of performing frequent hand hygiene (especially before and after each patient contact) should be reinforced.

HCP should self-assess for symptoms of febrile respiratory illness. In most cases, decisions about work restrictions and assignments for personnel with respiratory illness should be guided by clinical signs and symptoms rather than by laboratory testing for influenza because laboratory testing may result in delays in diagnosis, false negative test results, or both.

**4\. Adhere to Standard Precautions**

**During the care of any patient, all HCP in every healthcare setting should
adhere to standard precautions, which are the foundation for preventing
transmission of infectious agents in all healthcare settings.** Standard
precautions assume that every person is potentially infected or colonized with
a pathogen that could be transmitted in the healthcare setting. Elements of
standard precautions that apply to patients with respiratory infections,
including those caused by the influenza virus, are summarized below. All
aspects of standard precautions (e.g., injection safety) are not emphasized in
this document but can be found in the CDC Healthcare Infection Control
Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guideline titled _Guideline for
Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in
Healthcare Settings, Guidelines for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia
and Guidelines for Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings Published 2002 pdf

Hand hygiene in healthcare settings can be performed by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rubs. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water, not alcohol-based hand rubs.

In some cases, facilities may choose to apply droplet precautions for longer periods based on clinical judgment, such as in the case of young children or severely immunocompromised patients, who may shed influenza virus for longer periods of time.

When a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting [i.e., grouping patients infected with the same infectious agents together to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with susceptible patients], keeping the patient with an existing roommate).

**6\. Use Caution when Performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures**

Some procedures performed on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza
infection may be more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious
respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. These
procedures potentially put HCP at an increased risk for influenza exposure.
Although there are limited data available on influenza transmission related to
such aerosols, many authorities [refs: WHOexternal icon, recommend that
additional precautions be used when such procedures are performed. These
include some procedures that are usually planned ahead of time, such as
bronchoscopy, sputum induction, elective intubation and extubation, and
autopsies; and some procedures that often occur in unplanned, emergent
settings and can be life-saving, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
emergent intubation and open suctioning of airways. Ideally, a combination of
measures should be used to reduce exposures from these aerosol-generating
procedures when performed on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.
However, it is appropriate to take feasibility into account, especially in
challenging emergent situations, where timeliness in performing a procedure
can be critical to achieving a good patient outcome. Precautions for aerosol-
generating procedures include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Only performing these procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza if they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Limiting the number of HCP present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support. As is the case for all HCP, ensure that HCP whose duties require them to perform or be present during these procedures are offered influenza vaccination.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Conducting the procedures in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) when feasible. This will not be feasible for unplanned, emergent procedures, unless the patient is already in an AIIR. Such rooms are designed to reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent their escape into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. They are single patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Room doors should be kept closed except when entering or leaving the room, and entry and exit should be minimized during and shortly after the procedure. Facilities should monitor and document the proper negative-pressure function of these rooms.

Some of these units can connect to local exhaust ventilation systems (e.g., hoods, booths, tents) or have inlet designs that allow close placement to the patient to assist with source control; however, these units do not eliminate the need for respiratory protection for individuals entering the room because they may not entrain all of the room air. Information on air flow/air entrainment performance should be evaluated for such devices.

**7\. Manage Visitor Access and Movement Within the Facility**

Limit visitors for patients in isolation for influenza to persons who are
necessary for the patient's emotional well-being and care. Visitors who have
been in contact with the patient before and during hospitalization are a
possible source of influenza for other patients, visitors, and staff.

For persons with acute respiratory symptoms, facilities should develop visitor
restriction policies that consider location of patient being visited (e.g.,
oncology units) and circumstances, such as end-of-life situations, where
exemptions to the restriction may be considered at the discretion of the
facility. Regardless of restriction policy, all visitors should follow
precautions listed in the respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette section.

Visits to patients in isolation for influenza should be scheduled and
controlled to allow for:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Screening visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the hospital.

**8\. Monitor Influenza Activity**

Healthcare settings should establish mechanisms and policies by which HCP are
promptly alerted about increased influenza activity in the community or if an
outbreak occurs within the facility and when collection of clinical specimens
for viral culture may help to inform public health efforts. Close
communication and collaboration with local and state health authorities is
recommended. Policies should include designations of specific persons within
the healthcare facility who are responsible for communication with public
health officials and dissemination of information to HCP.

**9\. Implement Environmental Infection Control**

Detailed information on environmental cleaning in healthcare settings can be
found in CDC's Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care
Facilities and Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of
Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings [section IV.F. Care of the
environment.

Standard cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water
to preclean surfaces prior to applying disinfectants to frequently touched
surfaces or objects for indicated contact times) are adequate for influenza
virus environmental control in all settings within the healthcare facility,
including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are
performed. Management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste
should also be performed in accordance with standard procedures. There are no
data suggesting these items are associated with influenza virus transmission
when these items are properly managed. Laundry and food service utensils
should first be cleaned, then sanitized as appropriate. Some medical waste may
be designated as regulated or biohazardous waste and require special handling
and disposal methods approved by the State authorities.

**10\. Implement Engineering Controls**

Consider designing and installing engineering controls to reduce or eliminate
exposures by shielding HCP and other patients from infected individuals.
Examples of engineering controls include installing physical barriers such as
partitions in triage areas or curtains that are drawn between patients in
shared areas. Engineering controls may also be important to reduce exposures
related to specific procedures such as using closed suctioning systems for
airways suction in intubated patients. Another important engineering control
is ensuring that appropriate air-handling systems are installed and maintained
in healthcare facilities.

**11\. Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel**

Healthcare administrators should ensure that all HCP receive job- or task-
specific education and training on preventing transmission of infectious
agents, including influenza, associated with healthcare during orientation to
the healthcare setting. This information should be updated periodically during
ongoing education and training programs. Competency should be documented
initially and repeatedly, as appropriate, for the specific staff positions. A
system should be in place to ensure that HCP employed by outside employers
meet these education and training requirements through programs offered by the
outside employer or by participation in the healthcare facility's program.

**12\. Administer Antiviral Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Patients and
Healthcare Personnel when Appropriate**

Refer to the CDC web site for the most current recommendations on the use of
antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. Both HCP and patients
should be reminded that persons treated with influenza antiviral medications
continue to shed influenza virus while on treatment. Thus, hand hygiene,
respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices should continue while on
treatment.

**13\. Considerations for Healthcare Personnel at Higher Risk for
Complications of Influenza**

HCP at higher risk for complications from influenza infection include pregnant
women and women up to 2 weeks postpartum, persons 65 years old and older, and
persons with chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes,
diseases that suppress the immune system, certain other chronic medical
conditions, and morbid obesity. Vaccination and early treatment with antiviral
medications are very important for HCP at higher risk for influenza
complications because they can decrease the risk of hospitalizations and
deaths. HCP at higher risk for complications should check with their
healthcare provider if they become ill so that they can receive early
treatment.

Some HCP may identify themselves as being at higher risk of complications, and
express concerns about their risks. These concerns should be discussed and the
importance of careful adherence to these guidelines should be emphasized. Work
accommodations to avoid potentially high-risk exposure scenarios, such as
performing or assisting with aerosol-generating procedures on patients with
suspected or confirmed influenza, may be considered in some settings,
particularly for HCP with more severe or unstable underlying disease.1

Facemasks may be labeled as surgical, laser, isolation, dental or medical procedure masks. They may come with or without a face shield. If worn properly, a facemask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria) from reaching your mouth and nose. Facemasks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others. While a facemask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a facemask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes or certain medical procedures.
