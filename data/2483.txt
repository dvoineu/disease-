with Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus in the United States

This guidance pertains to avian influenza A(H7N9), a virus associated with
severe disease in humans, primarily in China.

This document provides **updated** interim guidance for state and local health
departments conducting investigations of human infections with avian influenza
A(H7N9) viruses. The following definitions are for the purpose of
investigations of confirmed and probable cases, and cases of avian influenza
A(H7N9) virus infection under investigation. CDC is requesting notification of
all **confirmed** and **probable** cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus
infection within 24 hours of identification. State health departments are
encouraged to investigate all persons who meet testing recommendations for
avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in the United States, to determine
their case status.

### Case Definitions

**Confirmed Case:** Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in a patient that
is confirmed by CDC's Influenza Laboratory or a CDC certified public health
laboratory using methods agreed upon by CDC and CSTE. Confirmation of avian
influenza A(H7N9) virus infections may be made by public health laboratories
following CDC-approved protocols for detection of avian influenza A(H7N9)
virus, or by laboratories using an FDA-authorized test specific for detection
of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

**Probable Case** : Illness compatible with influenza in a patient meeting any
of the exposure criteria below and for whom laboratory diagnostic testing is
positive for influenza A, negative for H1, negative for H1pdm09, and negative
for H3 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and therefore unable to be subtyped.

**Case Under Investigation** : Illness compatible with influenza in a patient
meeting any of the exposure criteria below and for whom confirmatory
laboratory test results are not known or pending.

Close contact may be regarded as coming within about 6 feet (2 meters) of a confirmed or suspected case while the case was ill (beginning 1 day prior to illness onset and continuing until resolution of illness). This includes healthcare personnel providing care for a confirmed case, family members of a confirmed case, persons who lived with or stayed overnight with a confirmed or suspected case, and others who have had similar close physical contact.2

1 As of January 10, 2014, China was the only country where avian influenza
A(H7N9) viruses were known to be circulating in animals (poultry) or where
human cases have become infected. For more information, including updates on
countries affected, please see the CDC Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus
information page.

2 Limited data are available for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in which
limited non-sustained person-to-person transmission could not be excluded in
some family clusters; limited non-sustained person-to-person transmission of
highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been reported in several
countries following close, prolonged unprotected contact with a severely ill
H5N1 patient, including in household and hospital settings.

3 Suspected cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection include probable
cases, cases under investigation, and other patients for whom available
clinical and epidemiologic information support a diagnosis of infection with
avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

**Avian influenza A viruses with the potential to cause severe human disease
currently include the following virusesdetected in wild and domestic birds in
the United States beginning in December 2014:**
