# Calorie count - Alcoholic beverages

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Alcoholic drinks, like many other drinks, contain calories that can add up
quickly. Going out for a couple of drinks can add 500 calories, or more, to
your daily intake. Most alcoholic drinks have little to no nutritional value.
If you are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you will want
to watch how much you drink. Cocktails mixed with soda, juice, cream, or ice
cream can have especially high calorie counts. If you find you are having
trouble cutting back on alcohol, talk with your health care provider.

Here is a list of some popular alcoholic beverages, their serving sizes, and
the number of calories in each.
