## Summary

Hospice care is end-of-life care. A team of health care professionals and
volunteers provides it. They give medical, psychological, and spiritual
support. The goal of the care is to help people who are dying have peace,
comfort, and dignity. The caregivers try to control pain and other symptoms so
a person can remain as alert and comfortable as possible. Hospice programs
also provide services to support a patient's family.

Usually, a hospice patient is expected to live 6 months or less. Hospice care
can take place

    * At home
    * At a hospice center
    * In a hospital
    * In a skilled nursing facility
