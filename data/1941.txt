_Black_ or _African American_ is defined by the Office of Management and
Budget as "a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of
Africa."1 There were over 40 million African Americans in the United States in
2016--approximately 13% of the U.S. population.2

Although African Americans usually smoke fewer cigarettes and start smoking
cigarettes at an older age, they are more likely to die from smoking-related
diseases than Whites.3,4,5,6,7,8

* "Current Use" is defined as self-reported consumption of cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco in the past month.  
† Data taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2018, and refer
to African American adults aged 18 years and older.

and are not presented.

### Health Effects

#### Tobacco use is a major contributor to the three leading causes of death
among African Americans--heart disease, cancer, and stroke.3,4,5

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death among African Americans.4 The risk of developing diabetes is 30-40% higher for cigarette smokers than nonsmokers.10

secondhand smoke than any other racial or ethnic group.12

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among the African American
population.

Critical Examination of Factors Related to the Smoking Trajectory among
African American Youth and Young Adultsexternal icon

![Nicotine & Tobacco Research](/tobacco/disparities/african-
americans/images/ntr-cover.jpg)

CDC's Office on Smoking and Health sponsored a special supplement to the
journal of _Nicotine & Tobacco Research_ titled Critical Examination of
Factors Related to the Smoking Trajectory among African American Youth and
Young Adults. The supplement focuses on disparities in tobacco use and
tobacco-related health outcomes between African Americans and Whites. Research
studies in the supplement highlight that African Americans have
disproportionately higher rates of several smoking-related diseases even
though African Americans start smoking later in life and smoke fewer
cigarettes per day than Whites. Interventions to prevent smoking initiation
and facilitate quitting among African Americans can help reduce disparities in
this population. In addition, addressing other broader, systemic issues such
as access to health care, screening and diagnostic services, and quality of
care may help reduce disparities in morbidity and mortality from tobacco-
attributable disease.
