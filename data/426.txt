## Summary

A stroke can cause lasting brain damage. People who survive a stroke need to
relearn skills they lost because of the damage. Rehabilitation can help them
relearn those skills.

The effects of a stroke depend on which area of the brain was damaged. The
types of disabilities a stroke can cause include

    * Paralysis or problems controlling movement
    * Pain and other problems with the senses
    * Problems using or understanding language
    * Problems with thinking and memory
    * Emotional disturbances

Stroke rehabilitation involves many kinds of health professionals. The goal is
to help stroke survivors become as independent as possible and to have the
best possible quality of life.
