## Summary

A heart transplant removes a damaged or diseased heart and replaces it with a
healthy one. The healthy heart comes from a donor who has died. It is the last
resort for people with heart failure when all other treatments have failed.
The heart failure might have been caused by coronary heart disease, damaged
heart valves or heart muscles, congenital heart defects, or viral infections
of the heart.

Although heart transplant surgery is a life-saving measure, it has many risks.
Careful monitoring, treatment, and regular medical care can prevent or help
manage some of these risks.

After the surgery, most heart transplant patients can return to their normal
levels of activity. However, fewer than 30 percent return to work for many
different reasons.
