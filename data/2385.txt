Overview

This site provides information on the independent peer review of documents
defined by NIOSH as influential in terms of their potential impact on public
policy or the private sector. NIOSH makes this information available to
demonstrate its efforts to utilize only the most transparent and independent
peer review, appropriate research methods, and the highest level of data
quality. In addition, this information demonstrates NIOSH compliance with the
specific requirements of the Information Quality Act (2000), 44 U.S.C.
§3516external icon, and of peer review standards developed by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). OMB requirements,
described in the Peer Review Bulletinpdf iconexternal icon, include making
publicly available specific information on the peer review of influential
documents disseminated by the federal government. OMB has defined two special
categories of influential information, Influential Scientific Information
(ISI) and Highly Influential Scientific Assessments (HISAs).

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is making selected
documents available for public review.

> Generally, an individual is on notice that any information submitted to the
> NIOSH Docket is considered public information.

As of December 18, 2019, the following NIOSH HISAs and ISI are under
development or published in final form:
