# Hansen's Disease (Leprosy)

Minus

Related Pages

Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy) is an infection caused by slow-
growing bacteria called  _Mycobacterium leprae_. It can affect the nerves,
skin, eyes, and lining of the nose (nasal mucosa). With early diagnosis and
treatment, the disease can be cured. People with Hansen's disease can continue
to work and lead an active life during and after treatment.

Leprosy was once feared as a highly contagious and devastating disease, but
now we know it doesn't spread easily and treatment is very effective. However,
if left untreated, the nerve damage can result in crippling of hands and feet,
paralysis, and blindness.
