Modeling epidemics and economics of disease provides useful information on how
to prevent the greatest amount of disease with existing resources. CDC is
supporting modeling activities to inform and, ultimately, improve the
effectiveness of public health programs and activities through the NCHHSTP
Epidemiologic and Economic Modeling Agreements (NEEMA).

During the first 5-year cooperative agreement (NEEMA 1.0; 2014-2019), multi-
disciplinary teams from NCHHSTP divisions collaborated with CDC-funded
partners: Emory University Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention
(CAMP), Harvard University Prevention Policy Modeling Lab, and the University
of California at San Francisco Consortium to Assess Prevention Economics
(CAPE). Nearly 60 manuscripts and 5 web-based tools as well as over 70
abstracts and presentations resulted from NEEMA 1.0.

In 2019, CDC funded a new 5-year cooperative agreement, NEEMA 2.0, that will
build on the work from NEEMA 1.0 in collaboration with the CDC-funded
partners, University at Albany Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention
and Stanford University Prevention Policy Modeling Lab.

NEEMA supports a wide range of modeling activities including those that
assess:
