# Cluster headache

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

A cluster headache is a rare type of headache. It is one-sided head pain that
may involve tearing of the eyes, a droopy eyelid, and a stuffy nose. Attacks
last from 15 minutes to 3 hours, occur daily or almost daily for weeks or
months. The attacks are separated by pain-free periods that last at least 1
month or longer.

Cluster headaches may be confused with other common types of headaches such as
migraines, sinus headache, and tension headache.

## Causes

Doctors do not know exactly what causes cluster headaches. They seem to be
related to the body's sudden release of histamine (chemical in the body
released during an allergic response) or serotonin (chemical made by nerve
cells) in the area of a nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve. A
problem in a small area at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus may
be involved.

More men than women are affected. The headaches can occur at any age, but are
most common in the 20s through middle age. They tend to run in families.

Cluster headaches may be triggered by:

      * Alcohol and cigarette smoking
      * High altitudes (trekking and air travel)
      * Bright light (including sunlight)
      * Exertion (physical activity)
      * Heat (hot weather or hot baths)
      * Foods high in nitrites (bacon and preserved meats)
      * Certain medicines
      * Cocaine 

## Symptoms

A cluster headache begins as a severe, sudden headache. The headache commonly
strikes 2 to 3 hours after you fall asleep. But it can also occur when you are
awake. The headache tends to happen daily at the same time of day. Attacks can
last for months. They can alternate with periods without headaches (episodic)
or they can go on for a year or more without stopping (chronic).

Cluster headache pain is usually:

      * Burning, sharp, stabbing, or steady
      * Felt on one side of the face from neck to temple, often involving the eye
      * At its worst within 5 to 10 minutes, with the strongest pain lasting 30 minutes to 2 hours

When the eye and nose on the same side as the head pain are affected, symptoms
can include:

      * Swelling under or around the eye (may affect both eyes)
      * Excessive tearing
      * Red eye
      * Droopy eyelid
      * Runny nose or stuffy nose on the same side as the head pain
      * Red, flushed face, with extreme sweating 

## Exams and Tests

Your health care provider can diagnose this type of headache by performing a
physical exam and asking about your symptoms and medical history.

If a physical exam is done during an attack, the exam will usually reveal
Horner syndrome (one-sided eyelid drooping or a small pupil). These symptoms
will not be present at other times. No other nervous system (neurologic)
changes will be seen.

Tests, such as an MRI of the head, may be needed to rule out other causes of
the headaches.

## Treatment

Treatment for cluster headaches involves:

      * Medicines to treat the pain when it happens
      * Medicines to prevent the headaches

TREATING CLUSTER HEADACHES WHEN THEY OCCUR

Your provider may recommend the following treatments for when the headaches
occur:

      * Triptan medicines, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex).
      * Anti-inflammatory (steroid) medicines such as prednisone. Starting with a high dose, then slowly decreasing it over 2 to 3 weeks.
      * Breathing in 100% (pure) oxygen.
      * Injections of dihydroergotamine (DHE), which can stop cluster attacks within 5 minutes (Warning: this drug can be dangerous if taken with sumatriptan).

You may need more than one of these treatments to control your headache. Your
provider may have you try several medicines before deciding which works best
for you.

Pain medicines and narcotics do not usually relieve cluster headache pain,
because they take too long to work.

Surgical treatment may be recommended for you when all other treatments have
failed. One such treatment is a neurostimulator. This device delivers tiny
electrical signals to certain nerves such as the occipital nerve in the scalp.
Your provider can tell you more about surgery.

PREVENTING CLUSTER HEADACHES

Avoid smoking, alcohol use, certain foods, and other things that trigger your
headaches. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When
you get a headache, write down the following:

      * Day and time the pain began
      * What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours
      * How much you slept
      * What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started
      * How long the headache lasted and what made it stop

Review your diary with your provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your
headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan.
Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them.

The headaches may go away on their own or you may need treatment to prevent
them. The following medicines may also be used to treat or prevent headache
symptoms:

      * Allergy medicines
      * Antidepressants
      * Blood pressure medicines
      * Seizure medicine

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Cluster headaches are not life threatening. They usually do not cause
permanent changes to the brain. But they are long-term (chronic), and often
painful enough to interfere with work and life.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 if:

      * You are experiencing "the worst headache of your life."
      * You have speech, vision, or movement problems or loss of balance, especially if you have not had these symptoms with a headache before.
      * A headache starts suddenly.

Schedule an appointment or call your provider if:

      * Your headache pattern or pain changes.
      * Treatments that once worked no longer help.
      * You have side effects from your medicine.
      * You are pregnant or could become pregnant. Some medicines should not be taken during pregnancy.
      * You need to take pain medicines more than 3 days a week.
      * Your headaches are more severe when lying down.

## Prevention

If you smoke, now is a good time to stop. Alcohol use and any foods that
trigger a cluster headache may need to be avoided. Medicines may prevent
cluster headaches in some cases.

## Alternative Names

Histamine headache; Headache - histamine; Migrainous neuralgia; Headache -
cluster; Horton's headache; Vascular headache - cluster; Episodic cluster
