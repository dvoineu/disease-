## Summary

Critical care helps people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses. It
might treat problems such as complications from surgery, accidents,
infections, and severe breathing problems. It involves close, constant
attention by a team of specially-trained health care providers. Critical care
usually takes place in an intensive care unit (ICU) or trauma center.

Monitors, intravenous (IV) tubes, feeding tubes, catheters, breathing
machines, and other equipment are common in critical care units. They can keep
a person alive, but can also increase the risk of infection.

Many patients in critical care recover, but some die. Having advance
directives in place is important. They help health care providers and family
members make end-of-life decisions if you are not able to make them.
