###  Overview

The purpose of the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) is to provide enhanced
behavioral, demographic, and clinical information on gonorrhea cases reported
to state and local health departments, to provide information on patients
presenting for care in STD and family planning clinical settings, and to
explore evolving health information technologies to improve STD surveillance
nationwide.  This information will allow CDC, as well as state and local
health departments, to better understand the epidemiology of STDs and to
inform national and local STD prevention efforts.

SSuN is a collaboration of competitively-selected state, county, and city
health departments that are provided funding to address STD surveillance
problems of national, state, and local interest. The network was established
in 2005 and is currently in Cycle 3 of funding under a cooperative agreement
for activities ongoing through 2018 (CDC-RFA-PS13-1306).  There are two major
components of SSuN, each addressing different issues in STD surveillance and
prevention.

**Part A**  of SSuN Cycle 3 provides support for selected health departments
to implement a range of population-level and facility-based activities
constituting the core functions of the network. Data from these two activities
are stripped of all specific identifying information and sent to CDC using
standardized formats and industry-standard confidentiality and security
measures.

Funded health departments doing population-level activities select a random
sample of reported gonorrhea cases and obtain additional information from
providers about the clinical presentation of these cases.  They also interview
patients to obtain additional demographic and behavioral information such as
age, race and Hispanic ethnicity, gender of recent sex partners, symptoms, and
treatment received.

Funded health departments also conduct facility-based sentinel surveillance in
specialty STD clinics and in facilities providing reproductive health
services. For these clinical settings, information on patient visits are
obtained, including STD tests performed at the visit, diagnoses received, and
demographic and some behavioral characteristics of the patient. Sentinel
surveillance is designed to provide evidence of trends in patients seeking
care, trends in provider testing practice, and changes in the number and
proportion of patients diagnosed with STDs.

**Part B**  Cycle 3 of this announcement funds four health departments to
implement robust and sustainable local collaborations with healthcare partners
in their jurisdiction to obtain electronic health data necessary for
monitoring STD prevention, measure clinical services delivered to patients,
and assess STD-related health outcomes across a wide range of provider
settings and data sources. Activities funded under **Part B** are considered
projects of "inherent national significance" because of their potential
applicability to STD programs nationwide.

Through this combination of collaborative activities, SSuN provides uniform,
comprehensive information on a representative sample of STD cases and provides
health departments with STD-related healthcare trend information not currently
available from any other source.  The following sections provide additional
information about the specific data collected, participating jurisdictions,
recent publications, and contact information of SSuN project officers.
