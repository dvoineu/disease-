## Summary

Breast cancer affects one in eight women during their lives. No one knows why
some women get breast cancer, but there are many risk factors. Risks that you
cannot change include

  * Age - the risk rises as you get older
  * Genes - two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested for the genes.
  * Personal factors - beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55

Other risks include obesity, using hormone replacement therapy (also called
menopausal hormone therapy), taking birth control pills, drinking alcohol, not
having children or having your first child after age 35, and having dense
breasts.

Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in size
or shape of the breast, and discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exams and
mammography can help find breast cancer early, when it is most treatable. One
possible treatment is surgery. It could be a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. Other
treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and
targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack
cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.

Men can have breast cancer, too, but it is rare.
