### What is malaria?

Malaria is a disease spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually appear
within in 7-30 days but can take up to one year to develop. Symptoms include
high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. Without treatment, malaria
can cause severe illness and even death.

### Who is at risk?

Malaria occurs in Africa, Central and South America, parts of the Caribbean,
Asia, Eastern Europe, and the South Pacific (See maps: Eastern Hemisphere and
Western Hemisphere). People spending time outdoors, including sleeping
outside, are at higher risk for malaria. Every year about 1700 cases of
malaria and 5 deaths occur among international travelers from the United
States. Read stories of  people who have had malaria.

### What can travelers do to prevent malaria?

![Anopheles mosquito](/travel/images/anopheles-mosquito.jpg)

Travelers can protect themselves from malaria by taking prescription medicine
and preventing mosquito bites.

#### Take prescription medicine if recommended for your destination:

                                                            * Talk to your doctor about which medicine is best for you.
                                                            * There are prescription medicines you can take to prevent malaria.
                                                            * Take this medicine **_before_** , **_during_** , and **_after_** your trip.

#### Prevent mosquito bites:

                                                            * Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats.
                                                            * Use an appropriate insect repellent as directed.
                                                            * Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. Use products with the following active ingredients: 
                                                              * **DEET** (Products containing DEET include Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, and Ultrathon)

                                                              * **Oil of lemon eucalyptus** **(OLE)** or **PMD** (Products containing OLE include Repel and Off! Botanicals)

                                                            * Always follow product directions and reapply as directed: 

![man spraying insect repellent on his arm](/travel/images/bugspray.jpg)

                                                              * If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.
                                                              * Follow package directions when applying repellent on children. Avoid applying repellent to their hands, eyes, and mouth.
                                                            * Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself: 
                                                              * Treated clothing remains protective after multiple washings. See the product information to find out how long the protection will last.

                                                              * Do **not** use permethrin directly on skin.
                                                            * Stay and sleep in screened or air conditioned rooms.
                                                            * Use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors.

#### If you are bitten by mosquitoes:

                                                            * Avoid scratching mosquito bites.
                                                            * Apply hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion to reduce itching.

#### If you feel sick and think you may have malaria:

                                                            * Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel seriously ill, especially if you have a fever up to 1 year after travel. 
                                                              * Tell them about your travel.
                                                              * For more information about medical care abroad, see Getting Health Care Abroad and a list of International Joint Commission-accredited facilities.
