# Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer

Minus

Related Pages

The latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer finds that for
all cancer sites combined, **cancer death rates continued to drop** in men,
women, adolescents and young adults, and children in the United States from
2001 to 2017. While there was some progress toward reaching the Healthy People
2020 targets for lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer in women, and
colorectal cancer, more work needs to be done to address disparities in cancer
screening and some risk behaviors.

The annual report is produced by CDC, the National Cancer Institute, the
American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries.

## Key Findings

Healthy People 2020 Targets

Targets were not met overall for cigarette smoking, recent smoking cessation,
excessive alcohol use, or obesity.
