Spotted fever group rickettsioses (spotted fevers) are a group of diseases
caused by closely related bacteria. These bacteria are spread to people
through the bite of infected mites and ticks. The most serious and commonly
reported spotted fever group rickettsiosis in the United States is Rocky
Mountain spotted fever (RMSF).

Other causes of spotted fever group rickettsioses (spotted fevers) in the
United States include:

Spotted fevers can range from mild to life-threatening. Most people who get
sick with a spotted fever other than RMSF will have an eschar (dark scab at
the site of tick or mite bite), fever, headache, and rash. Doxycycline is the
treatment of choice for all spotted fever infections.
