## Summary

If you get very sick or badly hurt and need help right away, you should use
emergency medical services. These services use specially trained people and
specially equipped facilities.

You may need care in the hospital emergency room (ER). Doctors and nurses
there treat emergencies, such as heart attacks and injuries. For some
emergencies, you need help where you are. Emergency medical technicians, or
EMTs, do specific rescue jobs. They answer emergency calls and give basic
medical care. Some EMTs are paramedics - they have training to do medical
procedures on site. They usually take you to the ER for more care.

If you or someone you know needs emergency care, go to your hospital's
emergency room. If you think the problem is life-threatening, call 911.
