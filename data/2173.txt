#  Gangrene

## Summary

Gangrene is the death of tissues in your body. It happens when a part of your
body loses its blood supply. Gangrene can happen on the surface of the body,
such as on the skin, or inside the body, in muscles or organs. Causes include

    * Serious injuries
    * Problems with blood circulation, such as atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease
    * Diabetes

Skin symptoms may include a blue or black color, pain, numbness, and sores
that produce a foul-smelling discharge. If the gangrene is internal, you may
run a fever and feel unwell, and the area may be swollen and painful.

Gangrene is a serious condition. It needs immediate attention. Treatment
includes surgery, antibiotics, and oxygen therapy. In severe cases an
amputation may be necessary.
