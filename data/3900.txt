The Road  
Ahead

Outbreaks around the world have been detected and stopped more rapidly than
ever before through CDC's investment in global health security.

Reductions in response time are seen in partner countries like Liberia. Since
2015, CDC has collaborated with Liberia's Ministry of Health to put in place a
network of sub-national emergency operation centers and staff trained through
CDC's Public Health Emergencies Management (PHEM) Fellowship. During a public
health event, this infrastructure can be stood up to coordinate a public
health response. CDC has also worked with the ministry of health to improve
specimen transport systems and laboratory diagnostic capacities, allowing for
suspected cases to be confirmed sooner than was possible before.

These dedicated efforts were put to the test during a 2017 outbreak of an
unconfirmed pathogen. The ministry of health mounted an emergency response in
less than 24 hours - a striking improvement compared to the more than 90 days
it took to respond when Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was detected in the country
in 2014. The pathogen was accurately identified as meningitis and the ministry
of health contained the outbreak to just 31 cases and avoided the catastrophic
consequences of further transmission. The improvement in emergency response
time demonstrates the progress that Liberia has made as a result of CDC-
supported efforts.

## Additional Examples of Rapid Response Through CDC's Investment:

Uganda

 **EVD Preparedness Pays Off**

Ugandans knew they had to get ready for the worst when neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) reported a new EVD outbreak on August 1, 2018.
Uganda's Ministry of Health (MOH) activated the Public Health Emergency
Operations Centre (PHEOC) and began preparedness activities. CDC-supported
global health security investments and efforts in Uganda have dramatically
helped the country reduce the time it takes to detect and respond to
outbreaks. CDC has been supporting the MOH and its implementing partner, the
Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), to map routes traveled between DRC and
Uganda, and points of interest within Uganda visited by Congolese, including
healthcare facilities like Kagando Hospital. Additionally, in April 2019, the
MOH, CDC, and other partners held a nationwide EVD outbreak simulation
exercise. When the first case of EVD associated with the recent DRC outbreak
was detected in Uganda in June 2019, the MOH was able to stand up a response
that held the number of confirmed cases to three - all of which were imported
from DRC had not resulted from circulation within Uganda.

Burkina Faso

 **Event-based Surveillance in Burkina Faso**

In 2017, CDC launched an event-based surveillance (EBS) program in Burkina
Faso that supported three district health teams, 210 assistant nurses and
chief nurses, and 935 community health workers. The EBS system was put to the
test when more than 200 donkeys died of unexplained illness across the country
between late 2018 and early 2019. Through effective field investigations, a
team of key partners - including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Animal and Fisheries Resources and CDC - determined two different causes for
the unexplained illnesses. One cause was strangles, an infectious respiratory
disease of donkeys, horses, and mules, and the other was anthrax, a serious
bacterial disease that can cause death in humans. Burkina Faso's rapid
response introduced control measures that prevented the loss of more livestock
and the spread of disease from animal to human.
