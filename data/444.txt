## Summary

Have you ever had the "stomach flu?" What you probably had was gastroenteritis
- not a type of flu at all. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining
of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites. Viral
gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the U.S. The cause is
often a norovirus infection. It spreads through contaminated food or water or
by contact with an infected person. The best prevention is frequent hand
washing.

Symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting,
headache, fever, and chills. Most people recover with no treatment.

The most common problem with gastroenteritis is dehydration. This happens if
you do not drink enough fluids to replace what you lose through vomiting and
diarrhea. Dehydration is most common in babies, young children, older adults,
and people with weak immune systems.
