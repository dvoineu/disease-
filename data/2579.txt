The eDOT Study Team

![The eDOT Study Team](/tb/worldtbday/2018/images/eDOT-studyTeam.jpg)

The New York City (NYC) Health Department, Columbia University, and CDC are
collaborating to conduct the eDOT Study; a randomized controlled trial
comparing traditional in-person directly observed therapy (DOT) with
electronic forms of DOT (eDOT) for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The eDOT
Study's Front Line Team works in tandem with the staff in four public health
TB clinics. Study team members work alongside TB clinic staff to provide eDOT,
collect information from patients participating in the study, record data in
the study database, and complete numerous tasks associated with day-to-day
study operations. Through their interactions with study participants, members
of the team have also assisted clinic staff in their efforts to direct
patients to appropriate services and enhance patients' overall experience in
the clinic. The team's collaborative relationship with clinic staff has
resulted in a successful integration of the study in the clinics' standard
operating practice so it is least disruptive to the clinic flow and patient
care.

Since the study began enrolling patients in July 2017, information related to
more than 4,500 individual doses of medication have been recorded. This
documentation includes information regarding the proportion of medication
doses directly observed by DOT versus eDOT; how frequently issues arise that
impede DOT and eDOT; patient adherence to DOT schedules; and patient
preferences. Over the course of the study, information related to more than
25,000 doses of medication will be documented. Through the study, the team has
expanded the use of eDOT in the NYC TB clinics and increased the proportion of
patients on eDOT. Moreover, team members have collected information on the
cost of DOT to both the TB program and the patient. This will identify
financial barriers to DOT in an effort to identify practical solutions.

The information collected through this study will contribute to the knowledge
base surrounding digital health interventions and help to inform future
policies and procedures related to eDOT. Further, the eDOT study team's
experience in expanding the use of eDOT in a program setting can be shared
with other TB programs seeking to implement or expand eDOT. Data collection
tools, scripts, and questionnaires developed/edited by the eDOT study team may
also serve as guides for other programs using eDOT or other digital health
interventions. Finally, this group serves as a model for how a study team can
successfully collaborate with existing clinic staff to benefit the TB program,
its patients, and the study.

The eDOT Study Front Line Team includes:

Liz Stapf

![](/tb/worldtbday/2018/images/LizStapf.jpg)

Some people fly under the radar doing amazing work for years. They quietly
fill a need that others have not realized. They are champions and change
agents. Liz Stapf is not only a TB survivor, but also a TB champion and change
agent. In 2011, Liz started a Facebook page simply called, _TB Support Group -
Advice, Sharing, and Info about Tuberculosis. _ Without any fanfare, while on
TB treatment, she nurtured a safe online space where she conversed with those
affected by TB about this long and often lonely journey. Since 2011, she has
supported hundreds of people in the United States and around the world through
their TB experience. Her goals were "To create a safe and supportive place;
offer advice from others' experience and my own; to be a friend and listening
ear; bring others together to support and connect with one another; and be
honest and open about the ups and downs of treatment and post-treatment
recovery. "Liz also shares her insights as a TB Photovoice BoardExternal
member. Liz is an advocate at the national level fighting for TB resources.

In 2017, Liz started a new private support group on Facebook called _TB
Support- Private Community_ and after 5 months, there are over 200 members.
The advantage of this private group is that it creates a safe community for
people to ask questions and talk about their diagnosis with others without
having to worry about stigma from their friends or communities. Many of the
posts receive over 30 responses from people with valuable advice or simply
offering understanding. Both Facebook pages have a variety of TB experiences
represented. These varied experiences lead to an amazing wealth of knowledge
and support. In Liz's words, "TB is a serious public health problem, it is
fought and controlled. But equally, TB is a private health problem, a problem
that is suffered at home, often alone, in the mind as well as in the body, a
problem which makes support and community necessary in our fight to make TB
and the isolation it brings with it a thing of the past."

Liz encourages health care providers to be open with their patients regarding
topics that are frequently discussed on these online resources, such as
questions related to side effects; what to expect during and after treatment;
and the topic of depression and stigma. Many people write to say, "No one told
me it was going to be this hard," or "I feel better so WHY should I continue
my meds?" Resources and discussion about these issues are critical and health
care providers play an important role in opening this dialogue. Liz believes
addressing some of these big hurdles during treatment and offering support can
boost treatment enrollment and efficacy. Many people are looking for
understanding and compassion, which is why Liz emphasizes, "even though it is
difficult you are not alone!"

Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing
significant damage to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH)
infrastructure, including laboratory buildings and equipment, rendering them
largely inoperable. Consequently, PRDOH was unable to detect and diagnose
tuberculosis (TB) among Puerto Rico's 3.5 million people. A collaboration with
the PRDOH (Public Health Laboratory and TB Control Program); CDC Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination Laboratory Branch; CDC Emergency Operations Center
Laboratory Team; and the Association of Public Health Laboratories resulted in
the implementation of a temporary transport system for Puerto Rico's TB
specimens from Puerto Rico to CDC.

CDC is the triage site for shipment of Puerto Rico's specimens to Georgia,
Florida, and Virginia public health laboratories (PHL) to support diagnostic
and confirmatory testing. Between October 2017 and early February 2018, PRDOH
has received, packaged, and shipped 231 TB specimens to CDC for referral to
the three state PHLs who then tested and reported results. Georgia, Florida,
and Virginia PHL support for Puerto Rico's TB testing needs after Hurricane
Maria allowed PRDOH to reestablish clinical testing and surveillance of TB
while awaiting the rebuilding and reinstatement of laboratory services. With
results from these PHL, PRDOH continued to diagnose and treat TB cases,
investigate TB cases, identify additional suspect cases, and monitor patients
currently on treatment. Without the collaboration of the PHLs and the PRDOH,
TB testing to inform patient care and public health interventions would not
have occurred.

Establishing relationships internally and externally among organizations with
similar missions is key when preparing for potential emergencies in which
clinical testing and surveillance could be compromised. Discussing and
developing a Continuity of Operations Plan to collaborate among one another
for diagnostic and referral testing is important for public health
laboratories and TB Control Programs. This successful collaboration highlights
the strong relationships among U.S. public health laboratories and the support
available for one another during challenging times.

Harris County Public Health Tuberculosis Elimination Program

![Harris County Public Health team
](/tb/worldtbday/2018/images/HarrisCountyPublicHealth.jpg)

In 2016, Texas ranked fourth in the nation for tuberculosis (TB) disease
burden, with 1,250 cases of active TB disease (4.5 per 100,000 population).
Harris County, Texas jurisdiction (not including City of Houston) had a TB
case rate of 4.4 per 100,000 population, over 65% higher than the national
rate (2.9 per 100,000 population). Harris County Public Health (HCPH)
implemented Video Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT), an innovative asynchronous
smart phone-based approach that allows patients to record TB medication doses
remotely, in addition to ongoing traditional Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
for TB treatment, where a health care worker monitors doses in person

On August 26, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Harris County. With the
forewarning of Harvey, the Champions from the Tuberculosis Elimination Program
continued to use VDOT in accordance to the guidelines and preparation plans
set forth by HCPH. During the hurricane, VDOT enabled patients to continue TB
treatment by submitting videos.

During Hurricane Harvey, a total of 108 patients were receiving TB treatment
in Harris County. Of those, 61 (57%) were on VDOT and 47 (43%) were on DOT.
VDOT patients were advised to continue treatment by submitting their videos to
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) compliant
platform, which were reviewed daily by TB staff. The 47 DOT patients were
advised to self-medicate, which does not count towards their treatment
completion.

As a result, 59 out of 61 (97%) of VDOT patients were able to continue their
TB treatment remotely with no interruptions. Two VDOT patients with
interruptions resumed treatment after 2 and 12 days, respectively. Due to
disruption in DOT services, the 47 DOT patients had their treatment prolonged
an average of 16 days.

Despite the disruption in health care system and delivery due to Harvey, VDOT
was proven beneficial for the continuation of TB treatment in a disaster. VDOT
use during Hurricane Harvey has generated traction in public awareness for TB
through recognition in Politico Magazine and CDC's MMWR Notes from the Field.
VDOT has improved TB treatment in Harris County by reducing the sigma of TB
and providing autonomy, flexibility, and confidentiality to patients at a
lower cost, while maintaining high treatment adherence rates. Given the
benefits VDOT has for ancillary TB treatment, VDOT has the capacity to improve
TB patient treatment and access to care across the nation.

Dr. Juzar Ali, Medical Director of the Louisiana State University Health
Sciences Center (LSUHSC)-Wetmore Foundation Program for Mycobacterial
Diseases, in New Orleans along with his team, (Nicole Lapinel, MD; Margarita
Silio, MD; Maureen Vincent CLSS; Chris Brown; and Malcolm Light) have
collaborated with the local hospital and community systems to ensure
streamlined care of adult and pediatric TB patients. These programmatic
improvements have led to better coordination of care of TB patients to and
from hospitals, emergency rooms, primary care clinics and homeless shelters.
They have also started a Video Direct Observed therapy (VDOT) pilot program
for patients with latent TB infection. Further, they have reached out to
primary care clinics and established a working relationship with the community
outreach team of Tulane and LSU medical students volunteering in the homeless
shelters. These efforts have created a process of referral, follow up of TB
patients at the community level, and helped establish a model of a Wetmore TB
Medical Home for these patients.

These efforts have increased awareness of TB management, assisted with TB
testing, and triage processes for their clients. It has streamlined
operational and referral workflow and reduced redundancy and cost of care. The
VDOT program, in its pilot phase, has reduced the inconvenience to the
clients, improved staff work productivity time, and decreased the use of
system resources and personnel. The clinic operations as described above have
identified challenges patients face in resource-challenged systems and in
settings where TB elimination may be difficult because of rapid staff turnover
and frequent mobility of patients. The TB Medical Home concept also
underscores the importance of family in treatment completion, and ensures a
multidisciplinary support and case management.

This project underscores the importance of "connecting the dots" of TB care
with primary and community care, in addition to ensuring treatment completion.
This helps in closing the healthcare delivery loop for individual clients and
patients in TB elimination and establishes access pathways with primary care
and specialty care if needed. It streamlines care coordination between
clinical, academia, community, and public health systems. Improved overall
patient care, enhanced patient engagement, experience, reduction in
redundancy, and cost of care are some of the potential overall benefits of
constructing a TB Medical Home concept in addition to the ability to focus on
aggressive comprehensive treatment, testing contacts, and follow through of TB
patients with other co-morbid conditions.

Breathe Easy South Texas (BEST)

EliminationProgram.jpg)

Breathe Easy South Texas (BEST) represents a partnership between the Texas
Department of State Health Services (DSHS), the San Antonio Metropolitan
Health District (SAMHD), UT Health at San Antonio, UT Tyler, and the Heartland
National TB Center. Together, these key partners are working to grow a network
of urban and suburban/rural clinics/organizations that will incorporate the
identification and treatment of latent TB infection in populations at
increased risk for latent TB infection into their practices. The uniqueness of
this project includes both a rural as well as an urban component. The rural
component deals mainly with smaller medical clinics in the surrounding outside
of Bexar County and San Antonio.

With funding from the Texas Medicaid 1115 Waiver, the Breathe Easy South Texas
(BEST) program was created and implemented to increase detection, treatment,
and treatment adherence rates, and to encourage the use of more advanced
testing techniques and treatment regimens. The BEST executive leadership team
is actively striving for a TB-free South Texas. The BEST Project is making an
impact in the South Texas Region with a dual approach to TB elimination:

Increasing efforts focused on targeted testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infections, particularly increased-risk populations including non-U.S.-born, diabetics, immunocompromised individuals, and persons experiencing homelessness or living in congregate settings.

Since the BEST Project began in 2014, TB cases have decreased by 22.5%. The
BEST project not only met its goal of identifying and testing 3,500 high-risk
unduplicated individuals per year for the initial 3 years (10,500 total), it
exceeded. To date, the BEST project has screened over 14,000 people for TB.
Our positivity rate is 8.53% with over 526 individuals testing positive. The
positivity rate is indicative of the tremendous success we have had targeting
populations at an increased risk for TB.

One of the biggest challenges has been to move those testing positive for TB
infection into the treatment stage. This requires the individual to obtain a
chest X-ray and come to the clinic for clinical assessment by physicians and
nurses. The BEST project currently has over 170 people starting treatment for
latent TB infection, with over 142 people completing treatment, for a minimum
completion rate of 83.5%. This rate will continue to increase to over 90% as
these individuals complete their 12-week regimen of medications. BEST's focus
on populations with an increased risk of TB has uncovered significant numbers
of patients with latent TB infection in need of treatment that otherwise may
not have been detected. The BEST Project will continue to expand activities in
an effort to continue eliminate TB locally and regionally.

Preston Witt is the Chief Services Officer for Harmony House. Preston oversees
services at Langston House, a joint-ventured facility between the City of
Houston TB program and Harmony House Inc. Langston House houses infectious or
displaced TB patients during their infectious period. It is one of the few
facilities of its kind operating within the United States.

Preston Witt has maintained a tremendous relationship with the City of Houston
TB Program for well over 10 years. During this time, the Houston Health
Department TB program has relied on Preston to resolve a host of TB patient-
related issues including; picking up infectious patients at the hospital and
transporting them to Langston House; assuring patients attend their medical
appointments; and when necessary convincing those infectious patients who want
to leave Langston House to stay. Any one of these accomplishments is
remarkable and he does them all on a regular basis. In addition, Preston has
been invited to CDC over the years to share his expertise with the homeless
community. He maintains leadership roles with various Houston-based homeless
coalitions.

The treatment completion rate of homeless patients admitted to Langston House
is a remarkable 85%. Much of the credit belongs to Preston and his ability to
connect with TB patients. Preston convinces the infectious TB patients to stay
rather than returning to a shelter where they could possibly spread TB to
others. There have been just two shelter-related contact investigations in
Houston since Langston House was opened 9 years ago. For his commitment and
dedication to TB, Preston Witt as a U.S. TB Elimination Champion.

pediatric TB expert Dr. Loeffler is the health department's go-to physician
for questions ranging from minor abnormalities on screening chest x-rays to
the management of medically and socially complex active TB disease patients,
including a patient with multidrug resistant TB (MDR TB). Dr. Loeffler
coordinated care for this patient across multiple entities and was a strong
patient advocate, spending many hours with the patient and the family
providing encouragement and support. She has also provided directly observed

outstanding care she provides to children with TB has minimized the spread of
TB in the community and saved lives. She is a trusted resource for physicians
and county health departments; helping to increase their confidence in
managing TB. Dr. Loeffler's person and family centered approach to care is a
vital part of local and statewide efforts to prevent and cure this disease. TB
elimination is possible when health care providers, the public health system
and other community partners team up to support individuals and families
affected by TB. Dr. Loeffler's passion for TB elimination and dedication to
her patients is a constant reminder of the importance of this work. Dr.
Loeffler excels at clinical consultation and patient advocacy for children who
often have few resources. As a clinical consultant, Dr. Loeffler provides an
ongoing, stable presence, which can be relied upon. This is essential in times
of rapid staff turnover and decreasing TB expertise in the community. As a
patient advocate, Dr. Loeffler refuses to give up and will always fight to
assist her patients with whatever is needed to help them successful complete
