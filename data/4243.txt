# Celiac disease - sprue

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Celiac disease is a condition caused by damage to the lining of the small
intestine. This damage comes from a reaction to eating gluten. This is a
substance that is found in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. It is also
found in food made from these ingredients.

The damaged intestine is not able to absorb nutrients from food.

## Causes

The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines
have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the
intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients.

When people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system
reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to
properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number
of symptoms and other health problems.

The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.

People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of
developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans. Women are
affected more often than men.

People with celiac disease are more likely to have:

    * Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome
    * Addison disease
    * Down syndrome
    * Intestinal cancer
    * Intestinal lymphoma
    * Lactose intolerance
    * Thyroid disease
    * Type 1 diabetes

## Symptoms

The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This
can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a
second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools.

Gastrointestinal symptoms include:

    * Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion
    * Constipation
    * Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged)
    * Diarrhea, either constant or off and on
    * Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment)
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed
    * Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight) 

Other problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb
key nutrients include:

    * Easy bruising
    * Depression or anxiety
    * Fatigue
    * Growth delay in children
    * Hair loss
    * Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)
    * Missed menstrual periods
    * Mouth ulcers
    * Muscle cramps and joint pain
    * Nosebleeds
    * Seizures
    * Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
    * Unexplained short height 

Children with celiac disease may have:

    * Defects in the tooth enamel and changes in tooth color
    * Delayed puberty
    * Muscle wasting
    * Diarrhea, constipation, fatty or foul-smelling stools, nausea, or vomiting
    * Irritable and fussy behavior
    * Poor weight gain
    * Slowed growth and shorter than normal height for their age 

## Exams and Tests

The following tests may be performed:

    * Bone density
    * Cholesterol (may be low)
    * Complete blood count (CBC \- test for anemia)
    * Comprehensive metabolic panel
    * Folate level (serum)
    * Iron level (serum)
    * Ferritin level
    * Prothrombin time
    * Vitamin B12 level (serum)
    * Vitamin D level 

Blood tests can detect antibodies, called antitissue transglutaminase
antibodies (tTGA) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) which may help detect
the condition. The health care provider will order these antibody tests if
celiac disease is suspected.

If the tests are positive, upper endoscopy is often performed to sample a
piece of tissue (biopsy) from the first part of the small intestine
(duodenum). The biopsy may show a flattening or loss of the villi in the parts
of the intestine affected in the duodenum.

Genetic testing of the blood can also be done to help detect who may be at
risk for celiac disease. Those who test negative for the common genetic
variant are unlikely to have celiac disease.

A follow-up biopsy or blood test may be ordered several months after the
diagnosis and treatment. These tests assess how well treatment is working.
Normal results mean that you have responded to treatment. This confirms the
diagnosis. However, this does not mean that the disease has been cured.

## Treatment

Celiac disease cannot be cured. Your symptoms will go away and the villi in
the intestines will heal if you follow a lifelong gluten-free diet. Do not eat
foods, drink beverages, or take medicines that contain wheat, barley, rye, and
possibly oats.

You must read food and drug labels carefully to look ingredients that may
include these grains. It may be hard to stick to a gluten-free diet because
wheat and barley grains are common in the American diet. Over time, most
people are able to adapt and get better. You should NOT begin the gluten-free
diet before you are diagnosed. Starting the diet will affect testing for the
disease.

In most cases, following a well-balanced, gluten-free diet is the only
treatment you need to stay well. Your health care provider may need to
prescribe vitamin and mineral supplements.

Sometimes, short-term use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be
needed if sprue does not respond to treatment.

When you are diagnosed, get help from a registered dietitian who specializes
in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet. A support group may also help you
cope with the disease and diet.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Following a gluten-free diet heals the damage to the intestines and prevents
further damage. This healing most often occurs within 3 to 6 months in
children. Recovery may take 2 to 3 years in adults.

Rarely, long-term damage will be done to the lining of the intestines before
the diagnosis is made.

Some problems caused by celiac disease may not improve, such as a short height
and damage to the teeth.

## Possible Complications

You must carefully continue to follow the gluten-free diet. When untreated,
the disease can cause fatal complications.

Delaying diagnosis or not following the diet puts you at risk for related
conditions such as:

    * Autoimmune disorders
    * Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fractures)
    * Certain types of intestinal cancer
    * Low blood count (anemia)
    * Infertility or repeated miscarriage
    * Liver disease

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you have symptoms of celiac disease.

## Prevention

Because the exact cause is not known, there is no way to prevent the
development of celiac disease. However, you should try to be aware of the risk
factors such as family history. This may increase your chances of early
diagnosis and treatment.

## Alternative Names

Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy
