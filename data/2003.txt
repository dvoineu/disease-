## Summary

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks
nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons
transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles -
the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. At first, this causes
mild muscle problems. Some people notice

    * Trouble walking or running 
    * Trouble writing 
    * Speech problems

Eventually, you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest
fail, you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help, but most people with
ALS die from respiratory failure.

The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it.
No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families, but usually it strikes
at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and, sometimes,
prolong survival.
