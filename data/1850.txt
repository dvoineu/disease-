## Summary

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of
your adrenal glands. Although they are usually benign, pheochromocytomas often
cause the adrenal gland to make too many hormones. This can lead to high blood
pressure and cause symptoms such as

    * Headaches
    * Sweating
    * Pounding of the heart
    * Being shaky
    * Being extremely pale

Sometimes pheochromocytoma is part of another condition called multiple
endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN). People with MEN often have other cancers
and other problems involving hormones.

Doctors use lab tests and imaging tests to diagnose it. Surgery is the most
common treatment. Other options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack
specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.
