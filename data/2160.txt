## Summary

When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the
bloodstream. The cells in your body need oxygen to work and grow. During a
normal day, you breathe nearly 25,000 times. People with lung disease have
difficulty breathing. Millions of people in the U.S. have lung disease. If all
types of lung disease are lumped together, it is the number three killer in
the United States.

The term lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs, such as
asthma, COPD, infections like influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis, lung
cancer, and many other breathing problems. Some lung diseases can lead to
respiratory failure.
