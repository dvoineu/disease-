## Summary

Mycobacteria are a type of germ. There are many different kinds. The most
common one causes tuberculosis. Another one causes leprosy. Still others cause
infections that are called atypical mycobacterial infections. They aren't
"typical" because they don't cause tuberculosis. But they can still harm
people, especially people with other problems that affect their immunity, such
as AIDS.

Sometimes you can have these infections with no symptoms at all. At other
times, they can cause lung symptoms similar to tuberculosis:

    * Cough
    * Weight loss
    * Coughing up blood or mucus
    * Weakness or fatigue
    * Fever and chills
    * Night sweats
    * Lack of appetite and weight loss

Medicines can treat these infections, but often more than one is needed to
cure the infection.
