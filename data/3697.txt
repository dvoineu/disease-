Rumination disorder is a condition in which a person keeps bringing up food
from the stomach into the mouth (regurgitation) and rechewing the food.

## Causes

Rumination disorder most often starts after age 3 months, following a period
of normal digestion. It occurs in infants and is rare in children and
teenagers. The cause is often unknown. Certain problems, such as lack of
stimulation of the infant, neglect, and high-stress family situations, have
been linked with the disorder.

Rumination disorder may also occur in adults.

## Symptoms

Symptoms include:

    * Repeatedly bringing up (regurgitating) food
    * Repeatedly rechewing food 

Symptoms must go on for at least 1 month to fit the definition of rumination
disorder.

People do not appear to be upset, retching, or disgusted when they bring up
food. It may appear to cause pleasure.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider must first rule out physical causes, such as hiatal
hernia, pyloric stenosis, and gastrointestinal system abnormalities that are
present from birth (congenital). These conditions can be mistaken for
rumination disorder.

Rumination disorder can cause malnutrition. The following lab tests can
measure how severe the malnutrition is and determine what nutrients need to be
increased:

    * Blood test for anemia
    * Endocrine hormone functions
    * Serum electrolytes

## Treatment

Rumination disorder is treated with behavioral techniques. One treatment
associates bad consequences with rumination and good consequences with more
appropriate behavior (mild aversive training).

Other techniques include improving the environment (if there is abuse or
neglect) and counseling the parents.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

In some cases, rumination disorder will disappear on its own, and the child
will go back to eating normally without treatment. In other cases, treatment
is needed.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Failure to thrive
    * Lowered resistance to disease
    * Malnutrition 

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if your baby appears to be repeatedly spitting up,
vomiting, or rechewing food.

## Prevention

There is no known prevention. However, normal stimulation and healthy parent-
child relationships may help reduce the odds of rumination disorder.
