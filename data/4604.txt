**Many adults may be at increased risk for pneumococcal disease and not know
it. Two vaccines provide protection against this serious and sometimes deadly
disease. Talk to your clinician to make sure you are up to date on these and
other recommended vaccines.**

Each year in the United States, pneumococcal disease kills thousands of
adults. Thousands more end up in the hospital because of pneumococcal disease.
It can cause severe infections of the lungs (pneumonia), bloodstream
(bacteremia), and lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Vaccines
are the best way to prevent pneumococcal disease.

Two vaccines help prevent pneumococcal disease:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine)

PCV13 protects against 13 strains of pneumococcal bacteria and PPSV23 protects
against 23 strains of pneumococcal bacteria. Both vaccines provide protection
against illnesses like meningitis and bacteremia. PCV13 also provides
protection against pneumonia.

### Pneumococcal Vaccines Are Safe

These vaccines are safe, but side effects can occur. Most side effects are
mild, such as arm swelling or soreness, and do not affect daily activities.

### You Shouldn't Get Both Pneumococcal Vaccines at the Same Time

CDC recommends against getting PCV13 and PPSV23 at the same time. If you need
both vaccines, get PCV13 first, followed by a shot of PPSV23 at another visit.
Talk with your healthcare professional to find out when you should come back
for the second vaccine.

### You Can Get Influenza and Either Pneumococcal Vaccine at the Same Time

You can get either pneumococcal vaccine (but not both) when you get the
influenza (flu) vaccine. While you don't need a pneumococcal vaccine every
year, it is important to get a flu vaccine each flu season. Having the flu
increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease.

### There Are Several Ways to Cover the Cost of Pneumococcal Vaccines

Most private health insurance policies cover pneumococcal vaccines. Check with
your insurance provider for details on whether there is any cost to you and
for a list of in-network vaccine providers. Medicare Part B also covers 100%
of the cost for both pneumococcal vaccines (when administered at least 1 year
apart).

Pneumococcal Disease Can Be Deadly for Older Adults

Most pneumococcal infections are mild. However, some can be deadly, especially
for adults 65 years or older:

### Many Healthcare Facilities Offer Pneumococcal Vaccines

Pneumococcal vaccines may be available at private doctor offices, public or
community health clinics, or pharmacies. Check with your doctor or pharmacist
to see if they offer pneumococcal vaccines. Use the Adult Vaccine
Finderexternal icon to help find places that provide pneumococcal vaccines
near you.

### Pneumococcal Disease Can Cause Both Mild and Serious Infections

Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
bacteria, also known as pneumococcus. Pneumococcal bacteria can cause many
types of illnesses that range from mild to very severe. When pneumococcal
bacteria spread from the nose and throat to ears or sinuses, it generally
causes mild infections. When the bacteria spread into other parts of the body,
it can lead to severe health problems (pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis).

These illnesses can be deadly, especially for:

Pneumococcal disease can lead to disabilities like deafness, brain damage, or
loss of arms or legs.

### Pneumococcal Disease Is Contagious

Pneumococcal bacteria spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing,
and close contact. People can carry the bacteria in their nose and throat
without being sick and spread the bacteria to others.
