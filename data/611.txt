## Summary

Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They
also can help find problems early, when your chances for treatment and cure
are better. Which exams and screenings you need depends on your age, health
and family history, and lifestyle choices such as what you eat, how active you
are, and whether you smoke.

To make the most of your next check-up, here are some things to do before you
go:

    * Review your family medical history
    * Find out if you are due for any general screenings or vaccinations
    * Write down a list of issues and questions to take with you
