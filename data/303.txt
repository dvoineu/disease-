## Summary

Health care can be costly. If you have health insurance, it usually pays at
least part of your medical costs. If you don't have insurance or need help
with costs that aren't covered, financial assistance might be available.
Certain government programs and nonprofit organizations can help. You can also
discuss concerns about paying your medical bills with your health care
provider, social worker or the business office of your clinic or hospital.
