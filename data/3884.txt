The Road  
Ahead

Complex problems such as under-preparedness require complex, multisector
solutions and CDC can amplify the impact of its public health programming
through partnership. In addition to government-to-government collaboration
with ministries of health, ministries of agriculture, and other relevant
ministries, CDC works with partner organizations to build and improve the
capacity to prevent, detect and respond to disease outbreaks. CDC leverages
partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, multilateral organizations,
the private sector, and other stakeholders to support this mission with host
governments and communities.

_" It takes strong partnerships bringing together the best science and
solutions across different sectors and technical areas to achieve meaningful
progress in global health security. Together with CDC, we are committed to
advancing global health security, in the United States and around the world."_

_-- _  _Loyce Pace, GHC President and Executive Director; Jamie Nishi, GHTC
Director; and Heather Ignatius, PATH Director of US & Global Advocacy -- Co-
Chairs of the Friends of CDC Global_

## Partnering with the World Health Organization

To improve global health security, CDC works with the World Health
Organization (WHO) to develop standardized assessment tools and guidance for
action planning to bring countries into alignment with the International
Health Regulations (IHR 2005). CDC contributed to the development of the Joint
External Evaluations (JEEs), a tool used to assess countries' health security
strengths and weaknesses, and CDC experts have participated in over 60% of the
JEEs conducted thus far[1]. From 2016 to early 2020, 112 JEEs have been
completed, representing over half of the United Nations member states that
committed to achieving the goals of the IHR 2005[2]. CDC also supports the
development of National Action Plans for Health Security (NAPHS), which
identify resources and define the actions needed to address the gaps
identified by the JEE. This allows countries to select high-priority actions,
arrange donor and/or domestic financing, and begin implementation immediately.

![CDC works closely with countries to identify priority actions from their
NAPHS that could be undertaken immediately to improve their JEE
scores.](/globalhealth/security/ghsa5year/images/JEE-page.jpg)

With these tools, countries can maintain high-level government attention on
health security, attract additional resources, and target existing resources
towards priority needs. CDC works closely with countries to identify priority
actions from their NAPHS that could be undertaken immediately to improve their
JEE scores. Through this process, Sierra Leone was able to lower the
programmatic costs of achieving their health security priorities and align
domestic resources to continue to build upon and sustain their achievements.
Uganda also utilized their NAPHS to identify workforce development as a health
security priority and secured 1.4 million U.S. dollars from private and non-
profit sectors to build the country's public health workforce capacity[3].

![The consortium is a formal member of the GHSA Steering Group and is made up
of a collective of non-governmental organizations dedicated to promoting
adherence to IHR 2005 and achieving the goals set out by the GHSA
framework.](/globalhealth/security/ghsa5year/images/dghp-field-
updates-2018-fall-P-22-large.jpg)

## Partnering with Non-Governmental Organizations

Through its GHSA work, CDC is collaborating with the Global Health Security
Agenda Consortium (GHSAC). The consortiumexternal icon is a formal member of
the GHSA Steering Group and is made up of a collective of non-governmental
organizations dedicated to promoting adherence to IHR 2005 and achieving the
goals set out by the GHSA framework. With a diverse array of members, GHSAC
works with GHSA member states and other countries to ensure multisectoral
engagement and provide technical expertise across all areas related to global
health security. CDC works closely with RTI International, a GHSAC member, to
support the Ministry of Health in Guinea in their efforts to bolster health
security. Through this partnership, CDC and RTI International have assisted
the ministry of health in rolling out an electronic information system for
surveillance and training health professionals in enhanced disease screening
and triage protocols[4],[5].

## Partnering with the Private Sector

CDC recognizes that the private sector can provide valuable resources and
multisector opportunities to improve health security. The Global Health
Security Agenda Private Sector Roundtable (PSRT) is a coalition of companies
dedicated to health security that provides a singular voice for the private
sector as a member of the international GHSA initiative. CDC has worked with
the PSRT throughout the first five years of GHSA to identify opportunities for
the private sector to support global health security goals in partner
countries. For example, CDC worked in partnership with the PSRT and Uganda's
Ministry of Health to update the country's NAPHS. This is part of a larger
cooperative effort between the Government of Uganda and PSRT to address
specific health security needs as identified by the JEE through workforce
trainings, employee secondments, and remote technical support.
