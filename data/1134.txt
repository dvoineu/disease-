Guidance for School-Based HIV/STD Prevention Recipients of PS18-1807

![document cover image for the PS18-1807 PROGRAM GUIDANCE: Guidance for
School-Based HIV/STD Prevention \(Component 2\) Recipients of
PS18-1807](/healthyyouth/images/partner/1807_program_guidance_cover.png)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded Program 1807
to improve the health and well-being of our nation's youth by working with
education and health agencies and other organizations to reduce HIV, STDs,
unintended teen pregnancy, and related risk behaviors among middle school and
high school students. To support this work, CDC developed PS18-1807 Program
Guidance. This guidance is based on scientific literature and expert input
about what is most likely to be effective in reducing risk for HIV infection
and other STDs among adolescents, including 3 strategies: sexual health
education (SHE), sexual health services (SHS), and safe and supportive
environments (SSE).
