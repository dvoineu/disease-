### Safe Water Saves Lives- How We Can Combat Cholera

Posted on March 13, 2020 by Andrea Martinsen

 _![](https://blogs.cdc.gov/global/files/2020/03/Zim_tapstand_2019_1185.jpg)_

_CDC public health engineer Andrea Martinsen works on the Global WASH team
within the Division of Global Health Protection (DGHP), where she responds to
international disasters, disease outbreaks, and humanitarian crises that
threatened the supply and provision of safe drinking water._

* * *

In September 2018, an outbreak of cholera was declared when 25 patients were
first admitted to the Beatrice Road Infectious Disease Hospital in Harare,
Zimbawbe. Cholera is a highly infectious disease, which can be spread through
food or by drinking water contaminated with feces from an infected person.
Like many other waterborne diseases, cholera is best prevented by properly
treating and chlorinating water, adopting healthy hygiene behaviors such as
handwashing, and safely disposing of fecal matter.

I, along with two other colleagues from DGHP, traveled to Harare to address
the major water challenges contributing to this outbreak as one component of
the CDC cholera response team. The City of Harareâs municipal water system
faced many challenges, including aging infrastructure, insufficient water
supply, and inconsistent free residual chlorine (FRC) levels.Â Most
importantly, free residual chlorine levels were too low, meaning the water
wasnât chlorinated to the recommended levels and not safe to drink.

First, CDC, along with the City of Harare Environmental Health Department and
UNICEF, began a municipal tap surveillance system to document water quality.
As a part of the system, several water taps around the city were sampled to
document water availability, free residual chlorine levels, pH, and turbidity,
or the amount of dirt or other small particles in the water. Booster
chlorination was priotized in highly-affected areas as a result.

Second, with funding provided by DGHPâs inter-agency agreement with the U.S.
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, we conducted an evaluation of in-line
chlorinators at hand pumps. As a result of the insufficient quanity of water
from the municipal water system, many people in Harare were using other water
sources, such as boreholes with hand pumps. These wells are not regulated and
may contain water contaminated with cholera or other pathogens, if not drilled
correctly.Â The installation of in-line chlorinators provides chlorination at
the point of collection of water, ensuring it is treated and safe to drink. It
also protects from secondary contamination within the household. However, when
we set out to evaluate the chlorinators in June of 2019, only 33% of water
points sampled had detectable free residual chlorine levels. Additionally,
only 14% of these points with detectable FRC had levels greater than 0.5 mg/L,
the level recommended by the World Health Organization during a cholera
outbreak. This means the majority of Harareâs citizens were drinking unsafe
water. Increasing the amount of water points with detectable and safe levels
of FRC was critical to controlling the outbreak.

To improve chlorination of drinking water during a cholera outbreak,
monitoring at all levels, whether it is the municipal water system or at the
point of water collection at hand pumps, is critical to ensure that we meet
WHO recommended levels and guarantee safety of all people.

Through strengthening capacity and responding to waterborne disease outbreaks,
we at CDC work in partnership to ensure everyone has access to clean and safe
water. Whether you call it _mvura, amanzi_ , or _agua_ âwater is essential
to a safe and healthy life.
