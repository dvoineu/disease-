## Summary

The thymus is a small organ in your upper chest, under your breastbone. Before
birth and during childhood, the thymus helps the body make a type of white
blood cell. These cells help protect you from infections.

Cancer of the thymus is rare. You are more likely to get it if you have other
diseases such as myasthenia gravis, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes
there are no symptoms. Other times, thymus cancer can cause

    * A cough that doesn't go away 
    * Chest pain
    * Trouble breathing

Doctors use a physical exam, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thymus
cancer. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. Other
options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.
