Instructions

The template health alert below can be adapted and used by a health department
to notify local public health practitioners, clinicians, public health
laboratories, and public information officers about an increase in congenital
syphilis in their jurisdiction. It is customizable - you should use data from
your jurisdiction to make it relevant to your community. You can customize
this article further by including local screening recommendations and a point
of contact for reporting confirmed, probable or suspected congenital syphilis
cases.

Penicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and treating fetal infection. Pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy must be desensitized and treated with penicillin.

Infected infants can be asymptomatic at birth, but can develop serious symptoms in the neonatal period or later in life.

## Background



Congenital syphilis rates in the US started to increase in 2012 and continued
to rise with an increase of almost 44% from 2016 to 2017. **[ _NOTE: The
jurisdiction can insert local epidemiology data here._ ]**

##### Symptoms

_Treponema pallidum_ causes syphilis and can present in several stages.  The
chancre of primary syphilis is painless and may not be noted by infected
persons as it resolves even without treatment.  Most patients who seek care do
so with secondary syphilis whose symptoms include a rash that may involve the
palms and soles, condyloma lata, and lymphadenopathy.  Left untreated,
syphilis can cause cardiac system abnormalities and neurological symptoms in
later stages.

A pregnant woman can transmit syphilis to her child during any stage of
syphilis and any trimester of pregnancy. However, the risk of transmission is
highest if the mother has been infected recently. Syphilis infection during
pregnancy increases adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth and
stillbirth.  Up to 40% of babies born to mothers with untreated syphilis (if
infected within four years prior to delivery) will be stillborn or die in
infancy.  Congenital syphilis can lead to newborn and childhood illness
including hydrops fetalis; hepatosplenomegaly; rashes; fevers; failure to
thrive; deformity of the face, teeth, and bones; blindness; and deafness.



## Recommendations:



##### Screening

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * All pregnant women residing in **_[jurisdiction_ ]** should be screened for syphilis **[ _NOTE: Insert any specific local screening recommendations._ ]**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Women who experience a stillbirth after 20 weeks of pregnancy should be tested for syphilis.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Infants should not be discharged from the hospital unless the mother has been tested for syphilis at least once during pregnancy and preferably again at delivery.

##### Diagnosis and Treatment

Syphilis during pregnancy

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Two tests are required to diagnose syphilis, a non-treponemal assay (i.e., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR]) and a confirmatory treponemal test (i.e., fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed [FTA-ABS] tests, the _pallidum_ passive particle agglutination [TP-PA] assay, etc). False positive non-treponemal tests are seen in pregnancy so confirmatory testing with a treponemal test is necessary to diagnose syphilis.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Adequate treatment of syphilis in pregnant women as soon as possible during pregnancy dramatically decreases the rate of congenital syphilis. Syphilis known to be acquired within the prior 12 months (primary, secondary, early non-primary non-secondary) should be treated with **4 million units of IM Benzathine penicillin G.   **Syphilis acquired >12 months prior (late syphilis) or of unknown duration should be treated with **Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals.** If doses are further apart than 7 days or missed, the treatment schedule must restart from the beginning.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Patients with penicillin allergies should be desensitized and treated with penicillin as it is the only known effective antimicrobial for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and treating fetal infection.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Partners should (at a minimum) be presumptively treated **(2.4 million units of IM Benzathine penicillin G)** to prevent reinfection during pregnancy. Ideally, they should be evaluated for syphilis by a provider and staged and treated appropriately.

All neonates born to women who have a reactive nontreponemal and treponemal
tests should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal serologic test
(RPR or VDRL) and be examined thoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis
(see details in CDC treatment guidelines
https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/congenital.htm).
