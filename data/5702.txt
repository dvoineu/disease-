Leukoplakia are patches on the tongue, in the mouth, or on the inside of the
cheek.

## Causes

Leukoplakia affects the mucous membranes of the mouth. The exact cause is not
known. It may be due to irritation such as:

      * Rough teeth
      * Rough places on dentures, fillings, and crowns
      * Smoking or other tobacco use (smoker's keratosis), especially pipes
      * Holding chewing tobacco or snuff in the mouth for a long period of time
      * Drinking a lot of alcohol 

The disorder is more common in older adults.

A type of leukoplakia of the mouth, called oral hairy leukoplakia, is caused
by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is seen mostly in people with HIV/AIDS. It may
be one of the first signs of HIV infection. Oral hairy leukoplakia can also
appear in other people whose immune system is not working well, such as after
a bone marrow transplant.

## Symptoms

Patches in the mouth usually develop on the tongue (sides of the tongue with
oral hairy leukoplakia) and on the insides of the cheeks.

Leukoplakia patches are:

      * Most often white or gray
      * Uneven in shape
      * Fuzzy (oral hairy leukoplakia)
      * Slightly raised, with a hard surface
      * Unable to be scraped off
      * Painful when the mouth patches come into contact with acidic or spicy food 

## Exams and Tests

A biopsy of the lesion confirms the diagnosis. Examination of the biopsy may
find changes that indicate oral cancer.

## Treatment

The goal of treatment is to get rid of the leukoplakia patch. Removing the
source of irritation may cause the patch to disappear.

      * Treat dental causes such as rough teeth, irregular denture surface, or fillings as soon as possible.
      * Stop smoking or using other tobacco products.
      * Do not drink alcohol. 

If removing the source of the irritation does not work, your health care
provider may suggest applying medicine to the patch or using surgery to remove
it.

For oral hairy leukoplakia, taking antiviral medicine usually causes the patch
to disappear. Your provider may also suggest applying medicine to the patch.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Leukoplakia is usually harmless. Patches in the mouth often clear up in a few
weeks or months after the source of irritation is removed.

In some cases, the patches may be an early sign of cancer.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your provider if you have any patches that look
like leukoplakia or hairy leukoplakia.

## Prevention

Stop smoking or using other tobacco products. Do not drink alcohol, or limit
the number of drinks you have. Have rough teeth treated and dental appliances
repaired right away.

## Alternative Names

Hairy leukoplakia; Smoker's keratosis
