Chancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact.

## Causes

Chancroid is caused by a bacterium called _Haemophilus ducreyi_.

The infection is found in many parts of the world, such as Africa and
southwest Asia. Very few people are diagnosed in the United States each year
with this infection. Most people in the United States who are diagnosed with
chancroid got the disease outside the country in areas where the infection is
more common.

## Symptoms

Within 1 day to 2 weeks after becoming infected, a person will get a small
bump on the genitals. The bump becomes an ulcer within a day after it first
appears. The ulcer:

    * Ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 2 inches (3 millimeters to 5 centimeters) in diameter
    * Is painful
    * Is soft
    * Has sharply defined borders
    * Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material
    * Has a base that bleeds easily if it is banged or scraped 

About one half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women often have 4 or
more ulcers. The ulcers appear in specific locations.

Common locations in men are:

    * Foreskin
    * Groove behind the head of the penis
    * Shaft of the penis
    * Head of the penis
    * Opening of the penis
    * Scrotum

In women, the most common location for ulcers is the outer lips of the vagina
(labia majora). "Kissing ulcers" may develop. Kissing ulcers are those that
occur on opposite surfaces of the labia.

Other areas, such as the inner vagina lips (labia minora), the area between
the genitals and the anus (perineal area), and the inner thighs may also be
involved. The most common symptoms in women are pain with urination and
intercourse.

The ulcer may look like the sore of primary syphilis (chancre).

About one half of the people who are infected with a chancroid develop
enlarged lymph nodes in the groin.

In one half of people who have swelling of the groin lymph nodes, the nodes
break through the skin and cause draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes
and abscesses are also called buboes.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider diagnoses chancroid by looking at the ulcer(s),
checking for swollen lymph nodes and testing (ruling out) for other sexually-
transmitted diseases. There is no blood test for chancroid.

## Treatment

The infection is treated with antibiotics including ceftriaxone, and
azithromycin. Large lymph node swellings need to be drained, either with a
needle or local surgery.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Chancroid can get better on its own. Some people have months of painful ulcers
and draining. Antibiotic treatment often clears up the lesions quickly with
very little scarring.

## Possible Complications

Complications include urethral fistulas and scars on the foreskin of the penis
in uncircumcised males. People with chancroid should also be checked for other
sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, HIV, and genital herpes.

In people with HIV, chancroid may take much longer to heal.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your provider if:

    * You have symptoms of chancroid
    * You have had sexual contact with a person who you know has a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
    * You have engaged in high-risk sexual practices

## Prevention

Chancroid is spread by sexual contact with an infected person. Avoiding all
forms of sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent a sexually
transmitted disease.

However, safer sex behaviors may reduce your risk. The proper use of condoms,
either the male or female type, greatly decreases the risk of catching a
sexually transmitted disease. You need to wear the condom from the beginning
to the end of each sexual activity.

Soft chancre; Ulcus molle; Sexually transmitted disease - chancroid; STD -
chancroid; Sexually transmitted infection - chancroid; STI - chancroid
