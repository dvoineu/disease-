## Summary

Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because
it will damage their small intestine. If you have celiac disease and eat foods
with gluten, your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine.
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It may also be in other
products like vitamins and supplements, hair and skin products, toothpastes,
and lip balm.

Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the
digestive system, or in other parts of the body. One person might have
diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or
depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some
people have no symptoms.

Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the
disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from
your small intestine. Treatment is a diet free of gluten.
