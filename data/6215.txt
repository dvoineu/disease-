## PPE Guidance

**What is new in the latest update of the PPE guidance?**

CDC updated the Ebola PPE guidance to clarify certain points. The update
provides clarification on the rationale for respiratory protection, the role
of the trained observer, and the technical specifications for the types of
gowns and coveralls that are recommended. The new guidance also suggests
adding a doffing assistant, changing the order of boot cover removal, and
emphasizes the importance of cleaning the floor in the doffing area. You can
find the updated PPE guidance at https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/procedures-
for-ppe.html.

## Type of PPE

**What manufacturer of PPE should we use?**

CDC does not recommend a specific manufacturer of PPE. You should select PPE
from any manufacturer that meets the specifications outlined in the PPE
guidance document https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/procedures-for-ppe.html.

**Should tape be used to secure the gown sleeves to the inner gloves?**

Facilities may elect to use tape to secure gloves to a garment, however
facilities should note that experience in some facilities suggests taping can
increase the risk of contamination by making the doffing process more
difficult and cumbersome. If tape is used, care should be taken during PPE
removal so that the tape does not tear the PPE. Additionally, take care to
ensure the tape does not touch the worker's skin as removal of tape may cause
micro-abrasions. CDC does not promote or discourage the use of tape, but
rather advises facilities that opt to use tape to practice to see what kind of
tape and application approaches (such as folding the tape over at the end to
create a tab to facilitate removal) work best.

**Are thumb hooks (or thumb loops) a mandatory option for the gown or
coverall?**

Thumb hooks can be useful to help secure the cuff of the gown or coverall, but
they are not mandatory.

**Can PPE be altered (e.g., cut a thumb loop into the sleeve, cut off a hood
from coverall)?**

Altering PPE may affect the integrity of the garment so the user should
consult the manufacturer of the PPE to determine if any alterations are
acceptable that will maintain the usability of the PPE.

**How do we know if the gown or coverall that our hospital wants to purchase
is impermeable or fluid- resistant?**

Gown and coverall product information should state the standards to which the
garments conform, including those for impermeability or fluid resistance. To
ensure that the products you have meet the standards, you can also ask the
manufacturers if their product has met test standards for impermeability or
fluid resistance and where that testing was performed. At a minimum, the gown
or coverall must meet the requirements CDC has defined in the PPE guidance at
https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance.html

If you are purchasing surgical gowns, ask the manufacturer if they have
received FDA clearance. Surgical gown manufacturers are required to submit
performance data through the FDA clearance process while this is not required
by isolation gown and coverall manufacturers. Standards testing or FDA
clearance will provide you with assurances that the gown or coverall meets its
rated protection. Third party testing by an ISO 17025 certified laboratory may
provide additional confidence in the testing results. You must also ensure
that the protection rating is appropriate for the intended use. For more
details on the international standards, test methods, and specifications for
garments, see the technical document Considerations for Selecting Protective
Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection Against Microorganism in Blood and
Body Fluids

**Why does CDC recommend that gowns and coveralls be impermeable or fluid-
resistant but does not recommend additional PPE components (e.g., boot covers,
surgical hood, apron) be fluid-resistant or impermeable as well?**

Currently these additional components are not consistently tested for
impermeability or fluid resistance using the same standards applied to gowns
and coveralls. Therefore, it would be difficult for users to ensure the
garments met testing standards.

**Should PPE be used by non-healthcare workers outside the hospital setting?**

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides specific
recommendations for PPE for some non-healthcare workers:
https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3761.pdfpdf iconexternal icon

NIOSH also provides recommendations for PPE for some non-healthcare workers:

**Should PPE be used by the general public?**

At this time, there are no recommendations for the use of PPE by the general
public. CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) have stated that there is
minimal risk of Ebola transmission to the general public. Only healthcare
workers and/or family and friends in close contact with patients with Ebola
are at the highest risk because they may come in contact with the blood or
body fluids of patients.

**Can we use Hazmat suits instead of PPE?**

The phrase "Hazmat suits" is often used to refer to the category of
"coveralls," which are included as an option in the PPE guidance. It is
important to ensure that the coveralls you select for use meets the
specifications outlined in the CDC Guidance on Personal Protective Equipment
To Be Used by Healthcare Workers During Management of Patients with Ebola
Virus Disease in U.S. Hospitals, Including Procedures for Putting On (Donning)
and Removing (Doffing).

It is also important not to focus on the specific type of equipment but its
performance characteristics and suitability for use during the intended work,
including ability of users to safely put on and remove the equipment.
Additional details about the selection of coveralls vs. gowns can be found in
Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for
Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids.

**Are healthcare workers protected from blood, body fluids, and other
potentially infectious materials when they wear any type of fluid-resistant
garment?**

Different types of gowns and coveralls have different standards for resisting
the penetration of body fluids and viruses. It is important to choose the
garment that meets the recommended specifications based on the patient's
clinical status and activities being performed. While a garment may be labeled
as "fluid-resistant" that does not mean it will provide resistance to blood,
body fluids, or viruses. Regardless of specification, protective garments must
be used correctly in order to ensure intended protection.

A more in-depth explanation of the scientific evidence and national and
international standards, test methods, and specifications for impermeable
protective clothing used in healthcare is available in the Considerations for
Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection Against
Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids. Specifications are outlined in the
CDC Guidance on Personal Protective Equipment To Be Used by Healthcare Workers
During Management of Patients with Ebola Virus Disease in U.S. Hospitals,
Including Procedures for Putting On (Donning) and Removing (Doffing).

**When should a healthcare worker use an apron as part of the PPE ensemble?
Should the apron or other PPE be disinfected or changed in the patient room if
it becomes soiled with bodily fluids from the patient?**

CDC recommends that a healthcare worker wear an apron over their gown or
coveralls any time a patient is vomiting or has diarrhea. An apron is
recommended in those circumstances to minimize the soiling of underlying PPE
and provide an easily discarded layer if the apron becomes soiled. An apron
should also be used routinely if the facility is using a coverall that has an
exposed, unprotected zipper in the front.

If there is significant soiling of the PPE, the healthcare worker should leave
the patient care area and take off the PPE in the doffing area under the
observation of a trained observer. Continuing to work in equipment that is
soiled creates additional risks for contamination.

Healthcare workers preparing to remove PPE should ask the trained observer to
visually inspect their PPE. The healthcare worker should then use disinfectant
wipes to remove as much of the soil as possible in order to decrease the risk
of contamination before beginning the doffing process. PPE must be removed
slowly and deliberately in the correct sequence to reduce the possibility of
self-contamination or other exposure to Ebola virus.

**Are there different combinations of PPE recommended depending on the
healthcare location (emergency department or outpatient clinic) and purpose of
entering the patient room (interview only, blood draw only, hands-on care) for
a suspected Ebola patient?**

PPE recommendations are based on the patient's clinical status and activities
being performed.

Recommendations for PPE to be worn when evaluating and caring for a confirmed
patient or person under investigation who is clinically unstable or has
obvious bleeding, vomiting or diarrhea, are provided in CDC's Guidance on
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) To Be Used by Healthcare Workers During
Management of Patients with Confirmed Ebola Virus Disease or Patients Under
Investigation (PUI) for Ebola Virus Disease who are clinically unstable or
have bleeding, vomiting or diarrhea in U.S. Hospitals, Including Procedures
for Putting On (Donning) and Removing (Doffing).

Recommendations for PPE to be worn when evaluating and caring for a person
under investigation who is clinically stable and not exhibiting obvious
bleeding, vomiting or diarrhea are provided in: For US Healthcare Settings:
Donning (Putting On) and Doffing (Taking Off) Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE) Procedures for Evaluating Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola
Virus Disease (EVD) Who Do Not Have Bleeding, Vomiting or Diarrhea _._

Recommendations for PPE to be worn by healthcare personnel acting as trained
observers and doffing assistants are provided in CDC's Guidance on Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) To Be Used by Healthcare Workers During Management
of Patients with Confirmed Ebola Virus Disease or Patients Under Investigation
(PUI) for Ebola Virus Disease who are clinically unstable or have bleeding,
vomiting or diarrhea in U.S. Hospitals, Including Procedures for Putting On
(Donning) and Removing (Doffing).

**Should trained observers use a bleach-wipe on the healthcare worker 's PPE
before it is doffed? Wouldn't there be a substantial risk that the observer
will get contaminated during this procedure?**

The trained observer has the sole responsibility of ensuring that donning and
doffing processes are followed properly and therefore should not assist the
healthcare worker with any part of cleaning or removal of the healthcare
worker's PPE. One exception where a designated doffing assistant or "buddy"
might be helpful is during the doffing of the PAPR, when assistance holding
the belt pack can be useful. Healthcare workers wearing PPE that has become
visibly soiled should disinfect the contaminated PPE surface before beginning
the removal process.

**How are Cal-OSHA standards different than CDC 's PPE guidance?**

The Cal-OSHA standards are consistent with what CDC recommends. Cal-OSHA has
limited the PPE options to PAPRs and coveralls. Other PPE options recommended
by CDC, such as the use of N95 respirators and gowns, have been used to safely
manage patients with Ebola in the United States.

CDC provides a limited number of PPE options for the safe care of patients
with Ebola that are based on the risks of exposure. For example, for
healthcare workers who are providing care for a patient who is under
evaluation for Ebola and does not have bleeding, vomiting or diarrhea, the
risk of exposure is low and there is specific PPE guidance for these
instances. When patients are known to have Ebola or when patients under
evaluation have bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea, the risk of exposure is
higher and the recommended PPE provides appropriate protection for that higher
risk.

**Are coveralls that meet NFPA 1999 (amended April 2015) acceptable to protect
healthcare workers when treating confirmed Ebola patients?**

Yes. NFPA 1999 incorporates the same ASTM F1671 standard for fabric and seam
viral penetration resistance as specified in the updated PPE guidance at
https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/procedures-for-ppe.html. NPFA 1999 also
provides additional categories of performance requirements that are not
addressed in the updated PPE guidance but are discussed in Considerations for
Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against
Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids.

## General

**Can a stethoscope be used with the PPE when caring for a patient with
Ebola?**

No. A traditional stethoscope cannot be used with personal protective
equipment (PPE) because the ears are covered. Alternative methods could be
considered, including wireless technology-enabled stethoscope or portable
Doppler ultrasound.

**Should personal jewelry be removed when using PPE?**

Yes. All personal items, including jewelry, watches, cell phones, pagers, and
pens, must be removed before donning PPE. These personal items may tear or
alter the fit of PPE garments.

**Can prescription eyeglasses be worn under PPE?**

Yes. Eyeglasses may be worn under PPE, but they should not interfere with the
respirator, specifically the seal of the facepiece to the face of the user.
They should be secured with a strap or tie so they do not come off during
doffing. They do not need to be disinfected if they are fully protected by the
PPE and not contaminated during the doffing process. If they are contaminated
during doffing they should be disinfected.

**Are there criteria or standards for PPE training?**

The guidance specifies that all requirements of an OSHA-compliant respiratory
protection program (under 29 CFR 1910.134) are to be met for all healthcare
workers wearing respirators as part of an Ebola-patient-care PPE ensemble,
which includes training on the assigned respirator model being used. All
healthcare workers wearing PPE must be trained on properly donning and doffing
PPE and must demonstrate competency as assessed by their employer. OSHA's
Bloodborne Pathogens standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) includes specific training
requirements. OSHA's PPE standards (29 CFR 1910.132, 1910.133, 1910.134, and
1910.138) also provide information about hazard assessment, selection and use
of appropriate PPE, training and other requirements necessary to protect
workers from chemical hazards. Healthcare workers should also be able to
effectively perform all patient care activities while wearing PPE. Please view
"Training on Correct Use of PPE" in the CDC Ebola PPE guidance at
https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/ppe-training/index.html.

## Shoes

**What type of shoes should be worn under the boot covers when wearing PPE
while caring for a patient with Ebola?**

Shoes should be closed-toe, soft-soled, with a closed back so they do not come
off during doffing, and without holes or perforations. The shoes should also
be made of a material that will not be compromised by the use of
disinfectants.

**What should be done with the shoes worn under the boot covers after PPE
doffing?**

The shoes should be disinfected as part of the doffing sequence. Disinfect
washable shoes by wiping the outer surfaces with an EPA-registered
disinfectant with a label claim for a non-enveloped virus (e.g., norovirus,
rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus). See EPA list of Disinfectants for Use
Against the Ebola Virus at http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list-l-ebola-
virus.htmlexternal icon.

## Respirators

**Should facial hair be removed when using PPE?**

The OSHA Respiratory Protection standard specifically requires employers not
to permit respirators with tight-fitting facepieces to be worn by employees
who have facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece
and the face or that interferes with valve function. See 29 CFR
1910.134(g)(1)(i). Healthcare workers must be fit tested to ensure that facial
hair will not interfere with the safe use of an N95 or other tight-fitting
respirators. Tight-fitting respirators cannot be used by people with facial
hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece and the face;
loose-fitting powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) can be worn by those
with facial hair.

**When should an N95 respirator versus a facemask be used for PPE when caring
for a patient with possible or confirmed Ebola?**

Recommendations depend on the patient's symptoms and clinical status.

Because of the possibility of suddenly needing to perform a potentially
aerosol-generating procedure, an N95, or higher level of particulate
filtration, respirator or a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) should be
worn when evaluating and caring for:

Clinically stable and will not require invasive or aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, suctioning, active resuscitation).

Facemasks are not designed to protect against breathing in very small particle
aerosols that may contain viruses and are not considered to be a respirator.

**What are the advantages and disadvantages of N95 respirators compared to
powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)?**

Airborne transmission of Ebola has not been documented during Ebola outbreaks
in settings such as hospitals or households. Respiratory protection is
recommended to protect healthcare workers in case there is a need for an
aerosol-generating medical procedure in a setting where safely exchanging PPE
is time consuming and logistically complex. Either a fit tested N95 respirator

**Are elastomeric face-piece respirators an acceptable alternative to PAPRs or
N95 respirators?**

The CDC guidance recommends PAPRs and N95 respirators as these are the types
of respiratory protection most commonly used in U.S. hospitals and because
both of these options have been used to safely care for patients with Ebola in
the U.S. Elastomeric face piece respirators could be an option provided: (1)
healthcare workers are fit tested for and trained in their use and are able to
tolerate wearing them for the duration of use, (2) consideration is given to
how they will work with the other recommended elements of Ebola PPE, and (3)
there is a protocol for disinfecting them after use. Elastomeric face piece
respirators, like PAPRs, require appropriate cartridges for the hazard(s)
present, such as a particulate or particulate/chemical combination cartridge.

**Is there a standard process for cleaning and disinfecting PAPRs?**

PAPRs must be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with manufacturer
recommendations; each PAPR has its own specifications. Healthcare employers
should develop a detailed protocol for disinfection to ensure proper
disinfection is completed. Facilities should have a designated location for
trained staff to clean and disinfect PAPRs. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant
with label claims for use against a non-enveloped virus; see EPA list of
Disinfectants for Use against the Ebola Virus at
http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list-l-ebola-virus.htmlexternal icon.

**Does a PAPR filter need to be removed and discarded after each use with
Ebola patient?**

CDC-NIOSH recommends users follow the manufacturer's guidance to determine the
need to replace/dispose of a filter during PAPR decontamination. Several
manufacturers have added specific instructions for cleaning, disinfecting, and
decontamination after use with a known or suspected Ebola patient.

**Where can employers find a list of PAPRs and N95 respirators that are NIOSH-
approved?**

While CDC-NIOSH does not endorse or recommend products, a list of NIOSH-
approved PAPRs meeting the preferred configuration can be found here:
https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/PPEebola.html#respprotection

A listing of N95 respirators can be found here:
https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/default.html

**Is it necessary that a healthcare worker be fit tested for a N95 respirator
since airborne transmission of Ebola is not believed to be a route of
infection? What happens if the respirator does not fit the worker?**

OSHA's Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134, requires fit testing
before wearing an N95 respirator.

While Ebola is not believed to be transmitted directly from patients to others
via an airborne route, certain medical procedures or other events might
mechanically generate aerosols that could be infectious.

Experience in the care of patients hospitalized with Ebola in the United
States indicates that the level of care may change unexpectedly and could
require the performance of an aerosol-generating procedure requiring the use
of a NIOSH-certified fit-tested respirator. Because donning and doffing PPE
for care of patients with Ebola is a time-consuming process there might not be
time for staff to leave the room to don proper PPE for an aerosol-generating
procedure. Hence, CDC recommends that all healthcare workers who enter the
room of a patient with Ebola wear respiratory protection that would protect
them during an aerosol generating procedure. This would include a NIOSH-
approved, fit tested N95 or higher level particulate respirator or a PAPR.

If a respirator fails a fit test, the employer should fit test the employee
using another respirator size or model until a respirator passing the fit test
is found or provide the employee with a loose-fitting PAPR.

## Gloves

**Do alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) treatments affect the integrity of medical
exam nitrile/latex gloves?**

Current CDC guidance for the disinfection of gloved hands during PPE doffing
allows for multiple applications of ABHR on medical exam gloves. Preliminary
results of an unpublished NIOSH research study suggest that these
recommendations should have little to no effect on the integrity of nitrile
and latex gloves for up to 6 applications of ABHR containing 70% ethanol.
However, the researchers also found that a 63% isopropanol-containing ABHR
caused the nitrile and latex gloves tested to become sticky to touch after
three or four applications and caused changes in the tensile properties of the
nitrile gloves. Additional experiments are underway to further evaluate this
phenomenon. Employers are encouraged to have healthcare workers responsible
for managing Ebola patients practice PPE donning and doffing procedures,
including hand hygiene. Switching the type of glove or the type of ABHR
product used is necessary if decreased glove integrity (e.g., they start to
tear or rip) or unusual changes (e.g., they become sticky, shrink, or harden)
that would affect work-related tasks are observed during training and
practice.

**Why does CDC recommend two pairs of gloves for caring for patients with
Ebola?**

Double-gloving provides an outer layer that allows convenient removal of a
heavily soiled glove during direct patient care and during the PPE removal
process. However, any additional layers of gloves (beyond double-gloving) may
make it more difficult to perform patient care duties and can put healthcare
workers at greater risk for injury (e.g., needlesticks), self-contamination
during care or doffing, or other exposures to Ebola. If healthcare facilities
decide to add additional PPE or modify this PPE guidance, they must consider
the risks and benefits of any modification, and train healthcare workers on
correct donning and doffing in the modified procedures.

**Do food-grade vinyl gloves provide adequate protection in dealing with
bloodborne pathogens?**

No. Medical-grade gloves provide a strong barrier to bloodborne pathogens,
such as those found in blood, urine, saliva, and infectious waste from
individuals with Ebola. Food-grade gloves do not meet these requirements,
which are set forth by the Food and Drug Administration.

## Donning/Doffing

**What does CDC recommend to prevent contamination of the floor? Are a variety
of techniques acceptable?**

There are a number of different approaches to prevent the contamination of the
floor. CDC's guidance suggests the following steps: (1) remove the shoe cover,
(2) disinfect the shoes, and (3) step into a clean area wearing disinfected
shoes.

Some facilities have recommended using pads and chemical mats as effective
options and the clarifications in the guidance highlight the potential utility
of these alternatives. The facility should choose an option that works best in
the specific environment. When approaches that require wetting the floor are
incorporated healthcare personnel must not be at risk for slipping during the
doffing process.

**If a caregiver is in a patient room for a long period of time, the caregiver
may need to sit down. This may cause the back side of the gown to be
contaminated. Will this affect doffing? (Or is the back side of the gown
always considered contaminated?)**

The room of a patient who has Ebola is considered contaminated and anything
that enters the room is also considered contaminated. CDC guidance suggests
that the front of the gown is where the risk of contamination is highest, but
the procedures for removing the PPE ensures that the outside of the PPE being
removed, including the back side, does not make contact with clothing, skin or
mucous membranes.

Facilities should be aware that some isolation gowns do not have an overlap of
fabric in the back when tied. Gowns with an overlap of fabric in the back
should be selected to protect clothing from inadvertent soiling as recommended
by CDC.

**What is the protocol for removing the trained observer 's PPE after that
person has helped someone doff? Does someone else have to "suit up" to help
the observer doff?**

Since the trained observer has not provided direct patient care and the
likelihood of having contaminated PPE is low, there is no need to have another
person put on PPE to monitor the removal of the observer's PPE. One option
that healthcare facilities have used is to have the healthcare worker who has
just doffed PPE stand at a distance in a clean area and act as the trained
observer who then observes the original trained observer doff their PPE using
the same protocol.

## Supplies

**How much PPE should our facility consider having on hand?**

To determine the amount of PPE a hospital needs for a multi-disciplinary team
managing a patient with Ebola, facilities should consider various factors
including: the acuity of patient, configuration of the healthcare team/roles
and intended interaction with the patient, the length of shifts, number of
required breaks for staff in PPE, the isolation unit location and support
strategies, the waste management strategy, lab location, lab testing demand,
and hospital protocols for products. Hospital inventory needs must be assessed
on a case-by-case basis and should consider these and any other relevant
factors.

**Hospitals are following CDC guidance for caring for patients with Ebola by
purchasing PPE. Will this increase in demand cause shortages in the
marketplace? Are manufacturers increasing production of PPE to meet healthcare
needs for the Ebola epidemic?**

CDC is aware that many hospitals in the United States have been ordering PPE
to increase preparedness levels for patients with Ebola. Across the United
States, availability for supplies recommended in CDC's Ebola PPE guidance
varies by product type and model, requested quantity, manufacturer,
distributor, and geographic region.

Some manufacturers have reported that they have increased production of PPE
products, and distributors are identifying ways to provide requested
quantities and meet delivery timelines. However, some products may be
available in smaller quantities than requested or with a later delivery date
than requested. HHS and CDC continue to stay in close contact with
manufacturers and distributors of medical equipment and supplies to maintain
situational awareness about availability of PPE and any shortages.

**What should a hospital do if it is notified by a distributor that a product
is unavailable or is experiencing extreme delays in availability?**

HHS and CDC are working with distributors and manufacturers to monitor the
current availability of PPE and understand alternative ways that customers can
find the supplies needed for training and evaluation and/or treatment of
patients with suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. The following options may
assist hospitals in obtaining PPE.

HHS and CDC continue to coordinate with manufacturers, distributors, and
healthcare facilities to monitor the availability of products in the supply
chain and to explore private sector and federal support strategies to address
shortfalls. Federal agencies, including HHS and CDC, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security, and Department of
Defense, are working together to understand overall product needs, current
stock levels, and orders in progress.

**Is CDC planning to use the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to assist with
PPE shortages?**

To increase preparedness, hospitals are encouraged to have PPE on hand in case
a patient with Ebola presents. CDC has increased quantities of PPE in the SNS
to assist U.S. hospital-based clinical teams in caring for patients with Ebola
in the event supplies are not immediately available at the treatment location.
SNS purchases are based on CDC PPE guidance. If other sources of PPE are not
immediately available, state health departments may consider requesting SNS
supplies to assist facilities. SNS PPE supplies are intended to provide a
stop-gap until additional product can be procured or identified for the
facility managing a patient with Ebola patient.

**Will these CDC-SNS orders of PPE further delay orders placed by hospitals?**

CDC is working closely with manufacturers to avoid disruptions to the
commercial supply chain as a result of the SNS purchases. No products are
being held by manufacturers or distributors specifically for SNS orders, and
SNS orders are not being prioritized ahead of orders placed by hospitals.

**How should hospitals allocate PPE for training purposes?**

Training healthcare workers on PPE is contributing to the current high demand
for products. Training with actual material should be limited to the essential
healthcare personnel most likely to care for a patient with Ebola, as
designated by a facility. If hospitals do not have sufficient PPE for
training, they should coordinate with their local and/or state health
departments to determine if other inventories of product are available for
this purpose. It is important to note that some PPE used for training purposes
can be used multiple times by the same worker or re-used by other workers if
cleaned and disinfected.

**Can PPE from the SNS be requested to assist with hospital training?**

PPE in the SNS is being reserved to assist U.S. hospital-based clinical teams
in caring for patients with Ebola in the event that supplies are not
immediately available at the treatment location.

Several groups--including CDC, state and local public health officials, and
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response--are working
collaboratively to help ensure that facilities that need PPE can get supplies.

**What should a facility do if they need more PPE supplies to care for a
patients with Ebola?**

If a facility is treating a confirmed patient with Ebola and needs more PPE
products, the facility should immediately contact its state and/or local
health department. State and local health departments may be able to identify
additional PPE supplies locally to supplement hospital inventory, request
federal assistance to help identify supplies from the commercial supply chain,
or obtain additional PPE from the SNS. State and local health departments
should use the standard, established process for requesting SNS assets. Once a
decision is made for CDC to provide PPE from the SNS, hospitals can expect
delivery in less than 24 hours.
