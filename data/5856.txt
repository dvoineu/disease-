# Nearsightedness

Nearsightedness is when light entering the eye is focused incorrectly. This
makes distant objects appear blurred. Nearsightedness is a type of refractive
error of the eye.

If you are nearsighted, you have trouble seeing things that are far away.

## Causes

People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts)
light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of
the eye.

Nearsightedness occurs when there is a mismatch between the focusing power of
the eye and the length of the eye. Light rays are focused in front of the
retina, rather than directly on it. As a result, what you see is blurry. Most
of the eye's focusing power comes from the cornea.

Nearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family
history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with
nearsightedness are healthy. However, but a small number of people with severe
nearsightedness develop a form of retinal degeneration.

## Symptoms

A nearsighted person sees close-up objects clearly, but objects in the
distance are blurred. Squinting will tend to make far away objects seem
clearer.

Nearsightedness is often first noticed in school-aged children or teenagers.
Children often cannot read the blackboard, but they can easily read a book.

Nearsightedness gets worse during the growth years. People who are nearsighted
need to change glasses or contact lenses often. Nearsightedness most often
stops progressing as a person stops growing in his or her early twenties.

Other symptoms may include:

      * Eyestrain
      * Headaches (uncommon) 

## Exams and Tests

A nearsighted person can easily read the Jaeger eye chart (the chart for near
reading), but has trouble reading the Snellen eye chart (the chart for
distance).

A general eye exam, or standard ophthalmic exam may include:

      * Eye pressure measurement (tonometry)
      * Refraction test, to determine the correct prescription for glasses
      * Retinal examination
      * Slit-lamp exam of the structures at the front of the eyes
      * Test of color vision, to look for possible color blindness
      * Tests of the muscles that move the eyes
      * Visual acuity, both at a distance (Snellen), and close up (Jaeger) 

## Treatment

Wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses can help shift the focus of the light
image directly onto the retina. This will produce a clearer image.

The most common surgery to correct myopia is LASIK. An excimer laser is used
to reshape (flatten) the cornea, shifting the focus.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Early diagnosis of nearsightedness is important. A child can suffer socially
and educationally by not being able to see well at a distance.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

      * Corneal ulcers and infections may occur in people who use contact lenses.
      * Rarely, complications of laser vision correction may occur. These can be serious.
      * People with myopia, in rare cases, develop retinal detachments or retinal degeneration.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if your child shows these signs, which may
indicate a vision problem:

      * Having difficulty reading the blackboard in school or signs on a wall
      * Holding books very close when reading
      * Sitting close to the television 

Call your eye doctor if you or your child is nearsighted and experiences signs
of a possible retinal tear or detachment, including:

      * Flashing lights
      * Floating spots
      * Sudden loss of any part of the field of vision 

## Prevention

It has been generally believed that there is no way to prevent
nearsightedness. Reading and watching television do not cause nearsightedness.
In the past, dilating eye drops were proposed as a treatment to slow the
development of nearsightedness in children, but those early studies were
inconclusive. However, there is recent information that certain dilating
eyedrops used in certain children at just the right time, may decrease the
total amount of nearsightedness that they will develop.

The use of glasses or contact lenses does not affect the normal progression of
myopia -- they simply focus the light so the nearsighted person can see
distant objects clearly. However, it is important to not prescribe glasses or
contact lenses that are too strong. Hard contact lenses will sometimes hide
the progression of nearsightedness, but vision will still get worse "under"
the contact lens.

Myopia; Shortsightedness; Refractive error - nearsightedness
