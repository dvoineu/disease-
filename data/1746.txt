## Health Topics

MedlinePlus publishes three types of health topic XML files daily (Tuesday-
Saturday):

    * MedlinePlus Health Topic XML
    * MedlinePlus Compressed Health Topic XML
    * MedlinePlus Health Topic Group XML

The six most recent files and their corresponding DTDs are linked at the
bottom of this section.

The MedlinePlus health topic XML files contain records for all English and
Spanish health topics. Each health topic record includes data elements
associated with that topic. This associated data includes:

    * basic metadata (health topic title, URL, language, date created, and ID),
    * vocabulary (MeSH, "Also called" terms, and see references),
    * full summary,
    * group membership,
    * related health topics,
    * equivalent English or Spanish topics,
    * related content in other languages,
    * primary NIH institute, and
    * all site records (links) assigned to a health topic page, including their names, URLs, organizations, category assignments, and standard descriptions.

These XML files allow you to download and use virtually all text and links
that appear on MedlinePlus health topic pages. For complete details on all
elements and attributes in the MedlinePlus health topic XML, see the
MedlinePlus XML file description.

The MedlinePlus Compressed Health Topic XML contains the same information as
the MedlinePlus Health Topic XML, but it is posted as a .zip file for easier
downloading.

The MedlinePlus health topic group XML files contain information on all
English and Spanish topic groups.
