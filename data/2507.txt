These outbreaks were caused by North American lineage viruses or North
American reassortant viruses that are different from Asian H5N1 and Asian H7N9
viruses that have caused human infections resulting in serious illness and
death in other parts of the world. Asian H5N1 and Asian H7N9 viruses have
**not** been detected in people or birds in the United States.

North American lineage avian influenza viruses have very rarely infected
people. CDC considers the risk to the general public from North American avian
influenza viruses to be low; however, because other avian influenza viruses
have infected people, it is possible that human infections with these viruses
could occur. Human infections with other avian influenza viruses have occurred
after close and prolonged contact with infected birds or the
excretions/secretions of infected birds (e.g., droppings, oral fluids). Risk
is dependent on exposure. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact
with infected birds or contaminated environments are likely to be at greater
risk of infection.

As a general precaution, people should avoid wild birds and observe them only from a distance; avoid contact with domestic birds (poultry) that appear ill or have died; and avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds.

This is consistent with guidance for exposure to novel influenza viruses with the _potential_ to cause severe disease in humans.
