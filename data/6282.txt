**Eggs are one of nature 's most nutritious and economical foods. But it's
important that you take care when handling and preparing fresh eggs and egg
products. **

The inside of eggs that appear normal can contain a germ called _Salmonella_
that can make you sick, especially if you eat raw or lightly cooked eggs. Eggs
are safe when you cook and handle them properly.

### How can I reduce my chance of getting a _Salmonella_ infection?

The inside of eggs that appear normal can contain a germ called _Salmonella_
that can make you sick, but eggs are safe when you cook and handle them
properly.

Poultry may carry bacteria such as _Salmonella_ , which can contaminate the
inside of eggs before the shells are formed. Egg shells may become
contaminated with _Salmonella_ from poultry droppings (poop) or the area where
they are laid.

### Illness from _Salmonella_ can be serious and is more dangerous for certain
people.

Adults older than 65 years, children younger than 5 years, and people with
weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or an organ
transplant, may get a more serious illness that can even be life threatening.

In most cases, illness lasts 4-7 days after eating a contaminated food.
Symptoms include:

Poultry may carry bacteria such as _Salmonella_ , which can contaminate the
inside of eggs before the shells are formed. Egg shells may become
contaminated with _Salmonella_ from poultry droppings (poop) or the area where
they are laid. Take care around backyard poultry to avoid _Salmonella_
infection.

Watch the story of Tyler's family, who changed how they interacted with their
birds after Tyler got sick from _Salmonella_.
