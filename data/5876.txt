The Tracking Network provides a foundation for public health programs
supporting infrastructure, data needs, and staff to address numerous public
health issues related to air and water threats, heat, chronic diseases, and
carbon monoxide poisoning and other acute environmentally-related health
effects.

CDC funds participation of 25 states and New York City in the Tracking
Network. These sites build their own local tracking systems and contribute
data to the Tracking Network. **These local tracking networks serve more than
190 million people, or 62%, of the U.S. population.**

## Funding at Work

**Responding to community concerns in Utah**  
The Tracking Network has allowed grantees to resolve pressing health concerns
much faster than before, which can save both lives and money. For example,
prior to having an established tracking program, it used to take public health
officials in Utah 6 months to a year to respond to public inquiries about
suspected health issues in their communities, such as disease clusters. Before
the Utah Tracking Network existed, a substantial amount of time had to be
spent acquiring and formatting data for these types of investigations. The
network provides a data warehouse to collect, organize and store data already
prepared for epidemiologic investigations and advanced tools for analysis.
Following the implementation of a tracking program in Utah, public health
officials are now able to quickly locate critical information needed to save
lives - in a matter of hours or days.

**Identifying high risk areas for childhood lead poisoning in Maine**  
Programs or interventions only protect public health if they target the right
people or risk factors, and the Tracking Network enables grantees to make sure
their efforts are targeted correctly. In order to ensure that those most at
risk of childhood lead poisoning were being targeted, the Maine Tracking
Program produced town-level maps to identify high-risk areas. The maps helped
staff see that 40% of all childhood lead poisonings occurred in just five
areas. Within these five areas, more than 80% of lead poisoned children lived
in rental housing. This allowed efforts to be targeted to vulnerable children
in high-risk areas, including proactive testing and follow up in 500 rental
units in high-risk neighborhoods. Subsequently, the tracking data indicate
that lead poisoning rates in three out of five high-risk areas have dropped
significantly.

**Issuing health alerts in Vermont**  
The public's health is put at risk when they are not kept informed of health
hazards, but providing up-to-date information can prove difficult. The
Tracking Network can allow grantees to provide the information people need to
protect themselves. The Vermont Tracking Program developed two new Web
applications that enable scientists to review and verify reports of Lake
Champlain blue-green algae conditions posted by citizen volunteers. Validated
observations that alert swimmers and boaters of potentially hazardous
situations are now provided to the public at more than 60 locations in near
real-time.
