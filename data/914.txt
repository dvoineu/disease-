### What is African tick-bite fever?

African tick-bite fever is a bacterial infection that is spread through the
bite of infected ticks. Symptoms usually appear within 2 weeks after a tick
bite and often include fever, headache, muscle soreness, and a rash. At the
site of the tick bite will be a red skin sore with a dark center.

### Who is at risk?

Travelers to sub-Saharan Africa and the West Indies are at risk of infection.
You may be at higher risk for African tick-bite fever if your travel plans
include outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and game hunting in
wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Ticks that are infected with tick-bite fever
are usually most active from November through April.

### What can travelers do to prevent African tick-bite fever?

There is no vaccine or medicine that prevents African tick-bite fever.
Travelers can protect themselves by preventing tick bites.

Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Be sure to remove ticks properly.
