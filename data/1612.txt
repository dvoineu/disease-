### Description:

Title: **Folic Acid And You: Your Healthy Pregnancy.**

Folic acid is a B vitamin. Getting 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every
day at least a month before becoming pregnant can help prevent serious birth
defects of the brain and spine. Here are three ways to get the recommended
daily amount of this important nutrient:

Make It Quick!: A fast way to get your daily dose of folic acid is to take a
multivitamin every day. Check the label to be sure it contains the recommended
daily amount of 400 mcg.

Make It Easy!: Many breakfast cereals contain 100% of the recommended daily
amount of folic acid per serving. Check the label to be sure.

Make It Delicious!: Give your vitamin intake a boost by enjoying a healthy
smoothie. Blend together these ingredients for a nutritious tropical smoothie:
1 small banana, ½ cup mango, ½ cup pineapple, ¾ cup orange juice, and ice.
