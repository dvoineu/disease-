## Summary

Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest
food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the
liver.

Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the
virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body
mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.

Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have

    * Loss of appetite
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Diarrhea
    * Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements
    * Stomach pain
    * Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes

Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to
scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer.

Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated
with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime. Vaccines can help prevent
some viral forms.
