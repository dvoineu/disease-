### What is trichomoniasis?

Trichomoniasis (or "trich") is a very common sexually transmitted disease
(STD). It is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas
vaginalis. Although symptoms of the disease vary, most people who have the
parasite cannot tell they are infected.

### How common is trichomoniasis?

Trichomoniasis is the most common curable STD. In the United States, an
estimated 3.7 million people have the infection. However, only about 30%
develop any symptoms of trichomoniasis. Infection is more common in women than
in men. Older women are more likely than younger women to have been infected
with trichomoniasis.

vaginalis_ parasites, magnified (seen under a microscope)

### How do people get trichomoniasis?

The parasite passes from an infected person to an uninfected person during
sex. In women, the most commonly infected part of the body is the lower
genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra). In men, the most commonly
infected body part is the inside of the penis (urethra). During sex, the
parasite usually spreads from a penis to a vagina, or from a vagina to a
penis. It can also spread from a vagina to another vagina. It is not common
for the parasite to infect other body parts, like the hands, mouth, or anus.
It is unclear why some people with the infection get symptoms while others do
not. It probably depends on factors like a person's age and overall health.
Infected people without symptoms can still pass the infection on to others.

### What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?

About 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms. When
trichomoniasis does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to
severe inflammation. Some people with symptoms get them within 5 to 28 days
after being infected. Others do not develop symptoms until much later.
Symptoms can come and go.

Having trichomoniasis can make it feel unpleasant to have sex. Without
treatment, the infection can last for months or even years.

### What are the complications of trichomoniasis?

Trichomoniasis can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually
transmitted infections. For example, trichomoniasis can cause genital
inflammation that makes it easier to get infected with HIV, or to pass the HIV
virus on to a sex partner.

![STDs During Pregnancy ](/std/images/promos/preg180.png)

### How does trichomoniasis affect a pregnant woman and her baby?

Pregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to have their babies too
early (preterm delivery). Also, babies born to infected mothers are more
likely to have a low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds).

### How is trichomoniasis diagnosed?

It is not possible to diagnose trichomoniasis based on symptoms alone. For
both men and women, your health care provider can examine you and get a
laboratory test to diagnose trichomoniasis.

### What is the treatment for trichomoniasis?

Trichomoniasis can be treated with medication (either metronidazole or
tinidazole). These pills are taken by mouth. It is safe for pregnant women to
take this medication. It is not recommended to drink alcohol within 24 hours
after taking this medication.

People who have been treated for trichomoniasis can get it again. About 1 in 5
people get infected again within 3 months after receiving treatment. To avoid
getting reinfected, all sex partners should get treated with antibiotics at
the same time. Wait to have sex again until everyone has been treated and any
symptoms go away (usually about a week). Get checked at 3 months to make sure
you have not been infected again, or sooner if your symptoms come back before
then.

### How can trichomoniasis be prevented?

The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.

If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your
chances of getting trichomoniasis:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. This can lower your chances of getting trichomoniasis.

Another approach is to talk about the potential risk of STDs _before_ you have
sex with a new partner. That way you can make informed choices about the level
of risk you are comfortable taking with your sex life.

If you or someone you know has questions about trichomoniasis or any other
STD, talk to a health care provider.
