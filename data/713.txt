**Michael F. Iademarco, MD, MPH  **is Director of the Center for Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). His expertise as a physician-scientist and
laboratorian provides a strong foundation to lead CDC's efforts to track
America's health, strengthen laboratory networks, and help public health
officials identify urgent health threats.

CSELS provides scientific service, expertise, skills, and tools in support of
CDC's mission. CSELS contains many of CDC's core scientific services and
products, including the _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)_ , _The
Community Guide_ , Epi InfoTM, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, the CDC
Learning Connection, Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and crucial national
disease surveillance systems.

Prior to this appointment, Dr. Iademarco served as Laboratory Branch Chief of
CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, where he oversaw clinical
laboratory referral services and helped strengthen laboratory capacity
building. From 2006 to 2010, he was the Department of Health and Human
Services Health Attache at the U.S. Mission in Vietnam, where he coordinated
U.S. health activities for the Embassy and was the in-country representative
for the Office of the Secretary. In 2011, Dr. Iademarco was awarded a
Government of Vietnam medal by the country's prime minister in part for his
work against HIV/AIDS. In addition, he served as Associate Director for
Science for the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, where he oversaw the
issuance of major TB guidelines.

Dr. Iademarco obtained his undergraduate degrees from Franklin & Marshall
College in mathematics and chemistry, medical degree from the University of
Virginia, and master's degree in public health from Saint Louis University. He
trained clinically and in research at Temple University Hospital in internal
medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in pulmonary medicine. Prior to joining
CDC, he was a faculty member of Washington University in St. Louis. Currently,
he is an adjunct faculty member of Emory University and serves as an attending
physician at the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center Medical
Intensive Care Unit. He is married with two children in college.
