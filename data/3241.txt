Meningococcal disease refers to any illness caused by bacteria called
_Neisseria meningitidis_ , also known as meningococcus [muh-ning-goh-KOK-us].
These illnesses are often severe and can be deadly. They include infections of
the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and bloodstream
infections (bacteremia or septicemia).

These bacteria spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat
secretions like spit (e.g., by living in close quarters, kissing). Doctors
treat meningococcal disease with antibiotics, but quick medical attention is
extremely important. Keeping up to date with recommended vaccines is the best
defense against meningococcal disease.

Risk of Meningococcal Disease When Taking a Complement Inhibitor

Taking complement inhibitors such as eculizumab (Soliris®) or ravulizumab
(Ultomiris™) increases your risk for meningococcal disease. Even if you
received meningococcal vaccines, you could still get meningococcal disease.
Learn more about this risk factor.

Signs and Symptoms

![Young woman with headache, she is sitting on the bed and touching her
temple.](/meningococcal/images/girl-headache.jpg)

Signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease usually start suddenly and include
fever, headache, and a stiff neck. It can start with symptoms similar to
influenza (flu).  Often people with meningococcal disease also have nausea,
vomiting, increased sensitivity to light, rash, and confusion. Learn more
