Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can
occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. These effects
can include physical problems and problems with behavior and learning. Often,
a person with an FASD has a mix of these problems.

### Cause and Prevention

FASDs are caused by a woman drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol in the
mother's blood passes to the baby through the umbilical cord.

There is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy or when trying to
get pregnant. There is also no safe time to drink during pregnancy. Alcohol
can cause problems for a developing baby throughout pregnancy, including
before a woman knows she's pregnant. All types of alcohol are equally harmful,
including all wines and beer.

To prevent FASDs, a woman should not drink alcohol while she is pregnant, or
might be pregnant. This is because a woman could get pregnant and not know for
up to 4 to 6 weeks.

If a woman is drinking alcohol during pregnancy, it is never too late to stop
drinking. Because brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, the sooner a
woman stops drinking the safer it will be for her and her baby. Resources are
available here.

FASDs are preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

### Signs and Symptoms

FASDs refer to the whole range of effects that can happen to a person whose
mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. These conditions can affect each person
in different ways, and can range from mild to severe.

### Types of FASDs

![](/ncbddd/fasd/images/mom-and-daughter-hugging.jpg)

Different terms are used to describe FASDs, depending on the type of symptoms.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS):** FAS represents the most involved end of the FASD spectrum. Fetal death is the most extreme outcome from drinking alcohol during pregnancy. People with FAS might have abnormal facial features, growth problems, and central nervous system (CNS) problems. People with FAS can have problems with learning, memory, attention span, communication, vision, or hearing. They might have a mix of these problems. People with FAS often have a hard time in school and trouble getting along with others.

They might do poorly in school and have difficulties with math, memory, attention, judgment, and poor impulse control.

They might have a mix of these.

The term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was previously used to describe
intellectual disabilities and problems with behavior and learning in a person
whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. In 1996, the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) replaced FAE with the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).

A child or youth with ND-PAE will have problems in three areas: (1) thinking and memory, where the child may have trouble planning or may forget material he or she has already learned, (2) behavior problems, such as severe tantrums, mood issues (for example, irritability), and difficulty shifting attention from one task to another, and (3) trouble with day-to-day living, which can include problems with bathing, dressing for the weather, and playing with other children. In addition, to be diagnosed with ND-PAE, the mother of the child must have consumed more than minimal levels of alcohol before the child's birth, which APA defines as more than 13 alcoholic drinks per month of pregnancy (that is, any 30-day period of pregnancy) or more than 2 alcoholic drinks in one sitting.

People with ND-PAE have problems with thinking, behavior, and life skills. ND-
PAE occurs from being exposed to alcohol during pregnancy.

### Diagnosis

The term FASDs is _not_ meant for use as a clinical diagnosis. CDC worked with
a group of experts and organizations to review the research and develop
guidelines for diagnosing FAS. The guidelines were developed for FAS only. CDC
and its partners are working to put together diagnostic criteria for other
FASDs, such as ARND. Clinical and scientific research on these conditions is
going on nowexternal icon.

Diagnosing FAS can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood
test, for it. And other disorders, such as ADHD (attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and Williams syndrome, have some symptoms like
FAS.

To diagnose FAS, doctors look for:

Abnormal facial features (e.g., smooth ridge between nose and upper lip)

Lower-than-average height, weight, or both

Central nervous system problems (e.g., small head size, problems with
attention and hyperactivity, poor coordination)

Prenatal alcohol exposure; although confirmation is not required to make a
diagnosis

### Treatment

![](/ncbddd/fasd/images/adhd-facts2.jpg)

FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but research shows that
early intervention treatment services can improve a child's development.

There are many types of treatment options, including medication to help with
some symptoms, behavior and education therapy, parent training, and other
alternative approaches. No one treatment is right for every child. Good
treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes as
needed along the way.

Also, "protective factors" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help
people with these conditions reach their full potential.1, 2

Protective factors include:

Diagnosis before 6 years of age

Loving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years

Absence of violence

Involvement in special education and social services

### Get Help!

If you or the doctor thinks there could be a problem, **ask the doctor for a
referral to a specialist** (someone who knows about FASDs), such as a
developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, or clinical geneticist. In
some cities, there are clinics whose staffs have special training in
diagnosing and treating children with FASDs. To find doctors and clinics in
your area visit the National and State Resource Directoryexternal icon from
the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS).

At the same time as you ask the doctor for a referral to a specialist, **call
your state or territory 's early intervention program **to request a free
evaluation to find out if your child can get services to help. This is
sometimes called a _Child Find_ evaluation. You do not need to wait for a
doctor's referral or a medical diagnosis to make this call. **     **

Where to call for a free evaluation from the state depends on your child's
age:

**If your child is younger than 3 years old** , Call your state or territory's
early intervention program and say: "I have concerns about my child's
development and I would like to have my child evaluated to find out if he/she
is eligible for early intervention services."

Find your state's early intervention contact information here.

**If your child is 3 years old or older** , contact your local public school
system.  
Even if your child is not old enough for kindergarten or enrolled in a public
school, call your local elementary school or board of education and ask to
speak with someone who can help you have your child evaluated.
