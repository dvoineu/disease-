## Summary

If you have coronary artery disease, the arteries in your heart are narrowed
or blocked by a sticky material called plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure to
restore blood flow through the artery.

You have angioplasty in a hospital. The doctor threads a thin tube through a
blood vessel in the arm or groin up to the involved site in the artery. The
tube has a tiny balloon on the end. When the tube is in place, the doctor
inflates the balloon to push the plaque outward against the wall of the
artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.

Doctors may use angioplasty to

    * Reduce chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart
    * Minimize damage to heart muscle from a heart attack

Many people go home the day after angioplasty, and are able to return to work
within a week of coming home.
