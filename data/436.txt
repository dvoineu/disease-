## Summary

Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes involuntary contractions of your
muscles. These contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements.
Sometimes they are painful.

Dystonia can affect just one muscle, a group of muscles or all of your
muscles. Symptoms can include tremors, voice problems or a dragging foot.
Symptoms often start in childhood. They can also start in the late teens or
early adulthood. Some cases worsen over time. Others are mild.

Some people inherit dystonia. Others have it because of another disease.
Researchers think that dystonia may be due to a problem in the part of the
brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. There is no cure.
Doctors use medicines, Botox injections, surgery, physical therapy, and other
treatments to reduce or eliminate muscle spasms and pain.
