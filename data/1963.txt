## Summary

Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a group of symptoms that start one to two
weeks before your period. Most women have at least some symptoms of PMS, and
the symptoms go away after their periods start. For some women, the symptoms
are severe enough to interfere with their lives. They have a type of PMS
called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD.

Common PMS symptoms include

    * Breast swelling and tenderness 
    * Acne
    * Bloating and weight gain
    * Pain - headache or joint pain
    * Food cravings 
    * Irritability, mood swings, crying spells, depression 

No one knows what causes PMS, but hormonal changes trigger the symptoms. No
single PMS treatment works for everyone. Over-the-counter pain relievers such
as ibuprofen, aspirin or naproxen may help ease cramps, headaches, backaches
and breast tenderness. Exercising, getting enough sleep, and avoiding salt,
caffeine, and alcohol can also help.
