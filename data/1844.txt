                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Smoking can exacerbate mental health symptoms and complicate treatment.1,2,6
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Quitting smoking can improve mental health and substance use disorder recovery outcomes.1,2,7-10

Nearly 25% of adults in the United States have a mental health or substance
use disorder (i.e., behavioral health condition), and these adults consume
almost 40% of all cigarettes smoked by adults in the United States.11

People with behavioral health conditions die about five years earlier than
people without such conditions, more than 50% from tobacco-attributable
diseases.12

The first step in addressing tobacco use among individuals with behavioral
health conditions is understanding the current available evidence.

### PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS…

![Photo of people talking in  a meeting](/tobacco/disparities/what-we-
know/behavioral-health-conditions/images/people-mtg.jpg)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. **Are more likely to smoke.**  
Individuals with a behavioral health condition are more likely to smoke than
people without such a condition,and smoking rates are even higher among
individuals with serious mental health disorders and addictions.1-2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. **Smoke more.**  
Individuals with behavioral health conditions smoke more cigarettes than
people who smoke and do not have these conditions.3-5

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. **Want to quit smoking.**  
Many individuals with behavioral health conditions want to quit smoking but
may face extra challenges in successfully quitting and may benefit from extra
help.13-14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. **Die prematurely.**  
Individuals with serious mental health disorders who smoke die almost fifteen
years earlier than individuals without these disorders who do not smoke.15

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5. **Die from smoking-related illness.**  
People with behavioral health conditions account for over 200,000, or nearly
half, of tobacco-related deathseach year.1,16 The most common causes of death
among people with behavioral health conditions are heartdisease, cancer, and
lung disease, all of which can be caused by smoking.7,12

### SMOKING AMONG PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS…

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. **Exacerbates symptoms of behavioral health conditions.**  
Smoking is associated with worse symptoms and outcomes among people with
behavioral health conditions, including greater depressive symptoms, greater
likelihood of psychiatric hospitalization, increased suicidal behavior, and
drug- and alcohol-use relapse.1,2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. **Reduces effectiveness of some medications.**  
Smoking can interact and interfere with psychiatric medications, often
resulting in the need for higher medication doses to achieve the same
therapeutic benefit.1,6

THE CASE FOR TOBACCO CESSATION TREATMENT

Behavioral health treatment settings have permitted tobacco use among clients,
in part because of misperceptions that smoking could alleviate symptoms of
mental health conditions and that cessation could interfere with treatment.1,2
However, research has shown that smoking can worsen symptoms and behavioral
health outcomes, and quitting can improve mental health and substance use
disorder treatment outcomes.1,2,9,10,13

### QUITTING TOBACCO…

![Photo of Rebecca](/tobacco/disparities/what-we-know/behavioral-health-
conditions/images/rebecca.jpg)

Rebecca M. started smoking at age 16. At age 33, she was diagnosed with
depression. As someone who smoked for many years, Rebecca turned to cigarettes
to help her cope. When she tried to quit and couldn't, she felt even more
depressed and started smoking again. Rebecca talks about how quitting made her
feel better - mentally and physically - in an ad from CDC's Tips From Former
Smokers® campaign.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. **Supports behavioral health treatment.**  
Growing evidence indicates that quitting smoking has positive effects on and
is associated with improvements in mental health. Quitting smoking does not
interfere with behavioral health treatment and does not worsen or impede
recovery from substance use disorders.1,2,7,13,14

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. **Could improve mental health.**  
Quitting smoking is associated with a decrease in depression, anxiety, and
stress, and can increase quality of life.1-2,7-9

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. **Could make relapse less likely.**  
Quitting smoking is associated with an increase in long-term abstinence from
alcohol and other drugs9 and a reduction in substance use disorder relapse.10

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. **Has immediate physical health benefits.**  
Quitting smoking dramatically reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and
cancer. For example, the risk for a heart attack drops sharply just one year
