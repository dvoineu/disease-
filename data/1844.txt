## Summary

Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney.
These glands produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex
hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other
functions.

A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands, including tumors. Tumors
can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones
are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign. They usually do not cause symptoms
and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.

Types of tumors include

    * Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland
    * Neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer
    * Pheochromocytoma \- a rare tumor that is usually benign

Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include
surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.
