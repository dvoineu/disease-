 **For less than $10 per student** , CDC programs demonstrate improvements in
behaviors and experiences that put students at risk for HIV, STD and
pregnancy.

### CDC Support Increases Implementation of Effective Interventions

From 2014 to 2018, CDC funded school districts reported:

![book](/healthyyouth/about/images/book.png)

Increased implementation of quality **Sexual Health Education** to **88%** of
middle schools and **93%** of high schools

![stethescope](/healthyyouth/about/images/stethescope.png)

Increased access to key youth friendly **Health Services** referring over
**65,000** students

![teens](/healthyyouth/about/images/teens.png)

Increased **Safe and Supportive Environments** by expanding student-led
inclusive clubs to **76%** of schools

#### Together, increased implementation of these strategies led to reductions
in population level sexual risk behaviors

From 2015 to 2017, CDC funded school districts saw statistically significant
declines in the percentage of students who:

![every had sex](/healthyyouth/about/images/ever_had_sex.png)

![were currently sexually
active](/healthyyouth/about/images/currently_sexually_active.png)

![had four or more lifetime sexual
partners](/healthyyouth/about/images/four_or_more_lifetime_partners.png)

#### CDC's Approach Improves Protective Factors and Health Outcomes

##### Well-implemented school connectedness strategies impact more than just
sexual behaviors.

From 2014 to 2018, CDC funded districts implemented four key school
connectedness strategies that led to declines in negative health behaviors and
experiences among students.

School connectedness interventions:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Family/community mentoring programs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Service learning opportunities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Student-led clubs to provide safe spaces
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Professional development for educators on classroom management
