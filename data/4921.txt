Welcome to CDC Grant Funding Profiles

The CDC Grant Funding Profiles site provides interactive data and summaries of
CDC cooperative agreement and grant funding to recipients in U.S. states and
territories, and the District of Columbia, starting with fiscal year (FY)
2010. The data is compiled in a format that allows users to view, sort, and
analyze funding data by funding opportunity announcement, funding source (CDC
funding category and sub-category), geography, and recipient name and type.

About the Data

The data and summaries for each fiscal year are provided annually after close
out of each fiscal year. The funding data include actions awarded (i.e.,
obligated funds) domestically in each federal fiscal year (October 1st of one
year to September 30th of the next year) from CDC's annual appropriation. The
funding data is categorized by CDC budget line (i.e., by which CDC
appropriation account was used to make the investment), as shown in each
year's operating plan, with some exceptions as described in "About the Data"
for each unique year. Because the data represent a point in time, and some
data is excluded, the data set does not reflect CDC's total appropriations in
any given area.
