## Summary

Genetic counseling provides information and support to people who have, or may
be at risk for, genetic disorders. A genetic counselor meets with you to
discuss genetic risks. The counseling may be for yourself or a family member.
Or you may get it when you are planning or expecting a baby. You may follow up
with genetic testing.

There are many reasons to seek genetic counseling. You may consider it if you

    * Have a personal or family history of a genetic condition or birth defect
    * Are pregnant or planning to be pregnant after age 35
    * Already have a child with a genetic disorder or birth defect
    * Have had two or more pregnancy losses or a baby who died
    * Have had ultrasound or screening tests that suggest a possible problem
