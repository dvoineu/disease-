Perianal streptococcal cellulitis is an infection of the anus and rectum
caused by streptococcus bacteria.

## Causes

Perianal streptococcal cellulitis usually occurs in children, often during or
after strep throat, nasopharyngitis, or streptococcal skin infection
(impetigo).

Children may infect the skin around the anus while cleaning the area after
using the toilet or by scratching with hands that have bacteria from their
mouth or nose.

## Symptoms

Symptoms may include:

    * Fever
    * Itching, pain, or bleeding with bowel movements
    * Redness around the anus

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine the child and ask about the symptoms.

Tests that may be done include:

    * Rectal swab culture
    * Skin culture from rectal area
    * Throat culture

## Treatment

The infection is treated with antibiotics for about 10 days, depending on how
well and quickly they are working. Penicillin is the most often used
antibiotic in children.

Topical medicine can be applied to skin and is commonly used with other
antibiotics, but it should not be the only treatment. Mupirocin is a common
topical medicine used for this condition.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Children usually recover quickly with antibiotic treatment. It is important to
contact your provider if your child does not get better soon on antibiotics.

## Possible Complications

Complications are rare, but may include:

    * Anal scarring, fistula, or abscess
    * Bleeding, discharge
    * Bloodstream or other streptococcal infections (including heart, joint, and bone)
    * Kidney disease (acute glomerulonephritis)
    * Severe skin and soft tissue infection (necrotizing fasciitis)

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your child's provider if your child complains of pain in the rectal area,
painful bowel movements, or other symptoms of perianal streptococcal
cellulitis.

If your child is taking antibiotics for this condition and the area of redness
gets worse, or the discomfort or fever is increasing, call your provider
immediately.

## Prevention

Careful handwashing can help prevent this and other infections caused by
bacteria carried in the nose and throat.

To prevent the condition from coming back, be sure your child finishes all the
medicine the provider prescribes.

## Alternative Names

Streptococcal proctitis; Proctitis - streptococcal; Perianal streptococcal
dermatitis
