## Summary

Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Usually the cause is a viral
infection, but bacteria can also cause it. It can be mild or severe. Most
cases are mild. You may have flu-like symptoms. With a mild case, you may just
need rest, plenty of fluids, and a pain reliever.

Severe cases need immediate treatment. Symptoms of severe cases include

    * Severe headache
    * Sudden fever
    * Drowsiness 
    * Vomiting
    * Confusion
    * Seizures

In babies, additional symptoms may include constant crying, poor feeding, body
stiffness, and bulging in the soft spots of the skull.

Severe cases may require a stay in the hospital. Treatments include oral and
intravenous (IV) medicines to reduce inflammation and treat infection.
Patients with breathing difficulties may need artificial respiration. Some
people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is
under control.
