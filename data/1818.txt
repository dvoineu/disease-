**Hepatitis C** is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus. Today, most people become infected with
the hepatitis C virus by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.
For some people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness but for 70%-85% of people
who become infected with the hepatitis C virus, it becomes a long-term,
chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C is a serious disease than can result in
long-term health problems, even death. Many people might not be aware of their
infection because they are not clinically ill. There is no vaccine for
hepatitis C. The best way to prevent hepatitis C is by avoiding behaviors that
can spread the disease, especially injecting drugs.
