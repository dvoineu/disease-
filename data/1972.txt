#  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis

Also called: GPA, Wegener's Granulomatosis

## Summary

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's
granulomatosis, is a rare disease. It is a type of vasculitis, or inflammation
of the blood vessels. The inflammation limits the flow of blood to important
organs, causing damage. It can affect any organ, but it mainly affects the
sinuses, nose, trachea (windpipe), lungs, and kidneys.

The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women
are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint
pain, weakness, tiredness, and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't
get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose
GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.

Early treatment is important. Most people improve with medicines to slow or
stop the inflammation.
