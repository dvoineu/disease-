## The physical design of our communities can improve or worsen our health.

**CDC 's Built Environment and Health Initiative (BEHI) focuses on** the
relationship between the built environment and several serious health
conditions. This initiative (also known as the Healthy Community Design
Initiative) gives state and local governments the knowledge and tools needed
to make planning and transportation decisions that protect American lives and
reduce healthcare costs.

**CDC 's Built Environment and Health Initiative is the only** federal program
whose primary purpose is to improve the health of all Americans through
evidence-based changes to the built environment.

## What does the Built Environment and Health Initiative do?

BEHI helps communities use health information to make efficient, locally
relevant decisions about transportation and land-use projects by:

-- Inform local decision makers outside of the traditional public health
arenas about how changes to the built environment can affect public health.  
-- Help communities evaluate the potential positive and negative health
effects of a plan, project, or policy before it is built or implemented.

## Is the Built Environment and Health Initiative making a difference?

**CDC 's Built Environment and Health Initiative has supported approximately
1/3 of the 350+ HIAs conducted in the United States to date**--and we continue
to do so through our 3-year cooperative agreements with local and state
governments and minigrants distributed through the National Association of
County and City Health Officials.

## Funding at Work

**Local - Crook County, Oregon**  
Small amounts of federal support for HIAs have led to big changes for rural
communities. For example, with only $15,000 in CDC funding, Crook County,
Oregon, used its HIA data to make a case for improved pedestrian and bicycle
paths. CDC funding resulted in policy and infrastructure changes that improved
pedestrian and bicycle safety around schools and road crossings. As a result,
the county seat received $500,000 from the state Department of Transportation
to implement the HIA recommendations.

**Local - Douglas County (Omaha), Nebraska**  
A CDC-funded HIA led to the county reducing the number of lanes on a dangerous
street, which improved the safety of the 15,000 people who use it each day,
potentially reducing motor vehicle crashes by 50 per year.

**Regional - Nashville, Tennessee**  
CDC provided technical assistance to the Nashville Metropolitan Planning
Organization in two key areas that had substantial impact. First, after health
was added as a criteria for selecting transportation projects, the percentage
of funded projects that included pedestrian or bicyclist infrastructure
increased from 2% to >70%. Second, results from a robust transportation and
health model found that increases in walking and bicycling resulting from
changes to Nashville's transportation infrastructure could save 70 lives and
$30 million per year. The assistance BEHI provided will help the Nashville MPO
prioritize how it allocates approximately $6 billion of transportation funding
over the next 20 years.

**National**  
CDC partners with the Alliance for Bicycling and Walking to publish with the
biennial Benchmarking Report. The report collects and analyzes data on
bicycling and walking behavior, policies, and infrastructure in every state
and the 52 most populated U.S. cities. Since the report's first publication in
2007, at least 42 jurisdictions with populations totaling 25 million people
have used it as a reference in considering policy changes and informing
stakeholders.
