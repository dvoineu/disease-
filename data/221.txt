## Summary

intestines. The obstruction can be complete or partial. There are many causes.
The most common are adhesions, hernias, cancers, and certain medicines.

Symptoms include

  * Severe abdominal pain or cramping 
  * Vomiting 
  * Bloating 
  * Loud bowel sounds 
  * Swelling of the abdomen 
  * Inability to pass gas

A complete intestinal obstruction is a medical emergency. It often requires
surgery.
