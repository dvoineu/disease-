## Summary

Everyone feels tired now and then. Sometimes you may just want to stay in bed.
But, after a good night's sleep, most people feel refreshed and ready to face
a new day. If you continue to feel tired for weeks, it's time to see your
doctor. He or she may be able to help you find out what's causing your fatigue
and recommend ways to relieve it.

Fatigue itself is not a disease. Medical problems, treatments, and personal
habits can add to fatigue. These include

    * Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain
    * Having medical treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation
    * Recovering from major surgery
    * Anxiety, stress, or depression
    * Staying up too late
    * Drinking too much alcohol or too many caffeinated drinks
    * Pregnancy

One disorder that causes extreme fatigue is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest.
Instead, it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily
activities.
