_Hispanic_ or _Latino_ is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as "a
person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other
Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race."1

In the United States, there are more than 55 million people of Hispanic or
Latino ethnicity.2 This group makes up approximately 17% of the current
estimated population,2 and is expected to comprise nearly 30% of the U.S.
population by the year 2060.3

Hispanic/Latino adults generally have lower prevalence of cigarette smoking
and other tobacco use than other racial/ethnic groups, with the exception of
Asian Americans.4,5 However, prevalence varies among sub-groups within the
Hispanic population.6

### Tobacco Use Prevalence

#### Current Tobacco Use* Among Hispanic/Latino Adults†5

tobacco: 1.3%; Cigars: 3.5%; Cigarettes:
16.6%](/tobacco/disparities/hispanics-latinos/images/hispanic-1.jpg)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Prevalence of cigarette smoking is higher among Hispanic adults born in the United States than those who were foreign-born.5

Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by Hispanic/Latino sub-groups:6

---|---  
Puerto Rican | 28.5%  
Cuban | 19.8%

* "Current Use" is defined as self-reported consumption of cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco in the past month.  
† Data taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2016,
and refer to Hispanic/Latino Americans aged 18 years and older.  
§ Prevalence data for Hispanic/Latino sub-groups taken from NSDUH, 2010-2013,
and include persons aged 18 years and older who reported smoking cigarettes
during the past month.

### Health Effects

#### Cancer, heart disease, and stroke--all of which can be caused by
cigarette smoking--are among the five leading causes of death among
Hispanics.7,8,9

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death among Hispanics.7 The risk of developing diabetes is 30-40% higher for cigarette smokers than nonsmokers.10

### Patterns of Tobacco Use

#### Variations in cigarette smoking exist among different Hispanic subgroups.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Number of cigarettes smoked per day is highest among Cuban daily smokers than daily smokers within other Hispanic/Latino groups.11

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Hispanic women generally have low prevalence of cigarette smoking during pregnancy.12

### Secondhand Smoke Exposure

#### During 2011-2012, nearly 58 million people were exposed to secondhand
smoke in the United States, including 6.2 million Mexican American
nonsmokers.13

### Quitting Behavior

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Among Hispanic current daily cigarette smokers aged 18 years and older:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Hispanics/Latinos have lower health insurance coverage and less healthcare access than Whites, making it less likely that they will be advised by a health care provider to quit smoking cigarettes or to have access to cessation treatments.15
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Hispanics, however, still quit smoking at higher rates than Whites and the general population.15

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Influence

#### Tobacco products are advertised and promoted disproportionately to
racial/ethnic minority communities. Tobacco companies seek to appeal to the
Hispanic population through branding, financial contributions, and targeted
advertising.16

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Historically, cigarette brand names such as "Rio" and "Dorado" have been heavily advertised and marketed to the Hispanic-American community, including advertisements in many Hispanic publications.16
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The tobacco industry has contributed to programs that enhance education of young people, such as funding universities and colleges and supporting scholarship programs targeting Hispanics.16
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The tobacco industry has also provided significant support to Hispanic political organizations, cultural events, and the Hispanic art community.16

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among the Hispanic/Latino
population.

Disparities in Adult Cigarette Smoking--United States, 2002-2005 and 2010-2013

Although cigarette smoking has declined significantly since the release of the
1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, disparities in tobacco
use varies among racial/ethnic populations. Moreover, estimates of U.S. adult
cigarette smoking and tobacco use are usually limited to aggregate racial or
ethnic population categories (non-Hispanic Whites (Whites), non-Hispanic
blacks or African Americans (blacks), American Indians and Alaska Natives
(AI/ANs), Asians, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders (NHPI), and
Hispanics/Latinos; these estimates can mask differences in cigarette smoking
prevalence among subgroups of these populations.
