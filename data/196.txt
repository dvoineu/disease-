## Summary

Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.
After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks
down and removes the clot. But some people get too many clots or their blood
clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or
prevent blood clots from dissolving properly.

Risk factors for excessive blood clotting include

  * Certain genetic disorders
  * Atherosclerosis
  * Diabetes
  * Atrial fibrillation
  * Overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome
  * Some medicines
  * Smoking
  * Staying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride
  * Cancer and cancer treatments

Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the brain, heart,
kidneys, lungs, and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called
deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If
a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to
the lungs and blocks blood flow, it is called a pulmonary embolism. Other
complications of blood clots include stroke, heart attack, kidney problems,
kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems. Treatments for blood clots
include blood thinners and other medicines.
