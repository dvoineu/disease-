## Summary

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that causes patches of abnormal tissue to grow
under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat, in lymph nodes,
or in other organs. These patches, or lesions, are usually red or purple. They
are made of cancer cells, blood vessels, and blood cells.

KS is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Most people
infected with HHV-8 don't get KS. It usually happens in

  * People with weak immune systems, due to HIV/AIDS, drugs taken after an organ transplant, or another disease
  * Older men of Jewish or Mediterranean descent
  * Young men in Africa

The skin lesions may not cause symptoms. But they can spread to other parts of
the body, especially in people with HIV/AIDS. If they spread to the digestive
tract or lungs, they can cause bleeding. Lesions on the lungs can also make it
hard to breathe.

Treatment depends on where the lesions are and how bad they are. Options
include radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy. People
with HIV/AIDS also take HIV/AIDS medicines.
