## Summary

Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing -- everyone knows the symptoms
of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. Every year, adults
get about 2-3 colds, and children get even more.

What can you do for your cold or cough symptoms? Besides drinking lots of
fluids and getting plenty of rest, you may decide to take medicines. There are
lots of different cold and cough medicines, and they do different things.

  * Nasal decongestants - unclog a stuffy nose
  * Cough suppressants - quiet a cough
  * Expectorants - loosen mucus so you can cough it up 
  * Antihistamines - stop runny noses and sneezing
  * Pain relievers \- ease fever, headaches, and minor aches and pains

Before taking these medicines, read the labels carefully. Many cold and cough
medicines contain the same active ingredients. For example, taking too much of
certain pain relievers can lead to serious injury. Do not give cold or cough
medicines to children under four, and don't give aspirin to children. Finally,
antibiotics won't help a cold.
