CDC now recommends 11 to 12 year olds get two doses of HPV vaccine--rather
than the previously recommended three doses--to protect against cancers caused
by HPV. The second dose should be given 6-12 months after the first dose. For
more information on the updated recommendations, read the press release:

#### A vaccines is available to prevent the human papillomavirus (HPV) types
that cause most cervical cancers as well as some cancers of the anus, vulva
(area around the opening of the vagina), vagina, and oropharynx (back of
throat including base of tongue and tonsils). The vaccine also prevents HPV
types that cause most genital warts.

### Why is the HPV vaccine important?

Genital HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another
through direct skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity. Most sexually
active people will get HPV at some time in their lives, though most will never
even know it. HPV infection is most common in people in their late teens and
early 20s. There are about 40 types of HPV that can infect the genital areas
of men and women. Most HPV types cause no symptoms and go away on their own.
But some types can cause cervical cancer in women and other less common
cancers -- like cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, and vulva and oropharynx.
Other types of HPV can cause warts in the genital areas of men and women,
called genital warts. Genital warts are not life-threatening. But they can
cause emotional stress and their treatment can be very uncomfortable. Every
year, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,000 women
die from this disease in the U.S. About 1% of sexually active adults in the
U.S. have visible genital warts at any point in time.

### Which girls/women should receive HPV vaccination?

HPV vaccination is recommended for 11 and 12 year-old girls. It is also
recommended for girls and women age 13 through 26 years of age who have not
yet been vaccinated or completed the vaccine series; HPV vaccine can also be
given to girls beginning at age 9 years. CDC recommends 11 to 12 year olds get
two doses of HPV vaccine to protect against cancers caused by HPV. For more
information on the recommendations, please see:
https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/questions-answers.html

### Will sexually active females benefit from the vaccine?

Ideally females should get the vaccine before they become sexually active and
exposed to HPV. Females who are sexually active may also benefit from
vaccination, but they may get less benefit. This is because they may have
already been exposed to one or more of the HPV types targeted by the vaccines.
However, few sexually active young women are infected with all HPV types
prevented by the vaccines, so most young women could still get protection by
getting vaccinated.

### Can pregnant women get the vaccine?

The vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. Studies show that the HPV
vaccine does not cause problems for babies born to women who were vaccinated
while pregnant, but more research is still needed. A pregnant woman should not
get any doses of the HPV vaccine until her pregnancy is completed.

Getting the HPV vaccine when pregnant is not a reason to consider ending a
pregnancy. If a woman realizes that she got one or more shots of an HPV
vaccine while pregnant, she should do two things:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Wait until after her pregnancy to finish any remaining HPV vaccine doses.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Call the pregnancy registry [800-986-8999 for Gardasil and Gardasil 9, or  888-825-5249 for Cervarix].

### Should girls and women be screened for cervical cancer before getting
vaccinated?

Girls and women do not need to get an HPV test or Pap test to find out if they
should get the vaccine. However it is important that women continue to be
screened for cervical cancer, even after getting all recommended shots of the
HPV vaccine. This is because the vaccine does not protect against ALL types of
cervical cancer.

###  How effective is the HPV Vaccine?

The HPV vaccine targets the HPV types that most commonly cause cervical cancer
and can cause some cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. It also
protects against the HPV types that cause most genital warts. The HPV vaccine
is highly effective in preventing the targeted HPV types, as well as the most
common health problems caused by them.

The vaccine is less effective in preventing HPV-related disease in young women
who have already been exposed to one or more HPV types. That is because the
vaccine prevents HPV before a person is exposed to it. The HPV vaccine does
not treat existing HPV infections or HPV-associated diseases.

### How long does vaccine protection last?

Research suggests that vaccine protection is long-lasting. Current studies
have followed vaccinated individuals for ten years, and show that there is no
evidence of weakened protection over time.

### What does the vaccine _not_ protect against?

The vaccine does not protect against all HPV types-- so they will not prevent
all cases of cervical cancer. Since some cervical cancers will not be
prevented by the vaccine, it will be important for women to continue getting
screened for cervical cancer. Also, the vaccine does not prevent other
sexually transmitted infections (STIs). So it will still be important for
sexually active persons to lower their risk for other STIs.

###  How safe is the HPV vaccine?

The HPV vaccine has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The CDC has approved this vaccine as safe and effective. The vaccine was
studied in thousands of people around the world, and these studies showed no
serious safety concerns. Side effects reported in these studies were mild,
including pain where the shot was given, fever, dizziness, and nausea. Vaccine
safety continues to be monitored by CDC and the FDA. More than 60 million
doses of HPV vaccine have been distributed in the United States as of March
2014.

Fainting, which can occur after any medical procedure, has also been noted
after HPV vaccination. Fainting after any vaccination is more common in
adolescents. Because fainting can cause falls and injuries, adolescents and
adults should be seated or lying down during HPV vaccination. Sitting or lying
down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and
injuries.

###  Why is HPV vaccination only recommended for women through age 26?

HPV vaccination is not currently recommended for women over age 26 years.
Clinical trials showed that, overall, HPV vaccination offered women limited or
no protection against HPV-related diseases. For women over age 26 years, the
best way to prevent cervical cancer is to get routine cervical cancer
screening, as recommended.

### What about vaccinating boys and men?

HPV vaccine is licensed for use in boys and men. It has been found to be safe
and effective for males 9 -26 years. ACIP recommends routine vaccination of
boys aged 11 or 12 years with with a series of doses. The vaccination series
can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is recommended for males
aged 13 through 21 years who have not already been vaccinated or who have not
received all recommended doses. The vaccine is most effective when given at
younger ages; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. CDC recommends
11 to 12 year olds get two doses of HPV vaccine to protect against cancers
caused by HPV. For more information on the recommendations, please see:

### Is HPV vaccine covered by insurance plans?

Health insurance plans cover the cost of HPV vaccines. If you don't have
insurance, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program may be able to help.

### How can I get help paying for HPV vaccine?

The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program helps families of eligible children
who might not otherwise have access to vaccines. The program provides vaccines
at no cost to doctors who serve eligible children. Children younger than 19
years of age are eligible for VFC vaccines if they are Medicaid-eligible,
American Indian, or Alaska Native or have no health insurance. "Underinsured"
children who have health insurance that does not cover vaccination can receive
VFC vaccines through Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health
Centers. Parents of uninsured or underinsured children who receive vaccines at
no cost through the VFC Program should check with their healthcare providers
about possible administration fees that might apply. These fees help providers
cover the costs that result from important services like storing the vaccines
and paying staff members to give vaccines to patients. However, VFC vaccines
cannot be denied to an eligible child if a family can't afford the fee.

### What vaccinated girls/women need to know: will girls/women who have been
vaccinated still need cervical cancer screening?

Yes, vaccinated women will still need regular cervical cancer screening
because the vaccine protects against most but not all HPV types that cause
cervical cancer. Also, women who got the vaccine after becoming sexually
active may not get the full benefit of the vaccine if they had already been
exposed to HPV.

###  Are there other ways to prevent cervical cancer?

Regular cervical cancer screening (Pap and HPV tests) and follow-up can
prevent most cases of cervical cancer. The Pap test can detect cell changes in
the cervix before they turn into cancer. The HPV test looks for the virus that
can cause these cell changes. Screening can detect most, but not all, cervical
cancers at an early, treatable stage. Most women diagnosed with cervical
cancer in the U.S. have either never been screened, or have not been screened
in the last 5 years.

### Are there other ways to prevent HPV?

For those who are sexually active, condoms may lower the chances of getting
HPV, if used with every sex act, from start to finish. Condoms may also lower
the risk of developing HPV-related diseases (genital warts and cervical
cancer). But HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom--so condoms
may not fully protect against HPV.

People can also lower their chances of getting HPV by being in a faithful
relationship with one partner; limiting their number of sex partners; and
choosing a partner who has had no or few prior sex partners. But even people
with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV. And it may not be possible to
determine if a partner who has been sexually active in the past is currently
infected. That's why the only sure way to prevent HPV is to avoid all sexual
activity.
