#  Gluten Sensitivity

Also called: Gluten Intolerance

## Summary

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in
foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins, and
supplements. People with gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is
different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat
gluten because it will damage their small intestine.

Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They
include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including
muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine
like celiac disease.

Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health
care provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating
gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to
rule out celiac disease.
