## Summary

Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on your skin. They often
appear on feet where the bony parts of your feet rub against your shoes. Corns
usually appear on the tops or sides of toes while calluses form on the soles
of feet. Calluses also can appear on hands or other areas that are rubbed or
pressed.

Wearing shoes that fit better or using non-medicated pads may help. While
bathing, gently rub the corn or callus with a washcloth or pumice stone to
help reduce the size. To avoid infection, do not try to shave off the corn or
callus. See your doctor, especially if you have diabetes or circulation
problems.
