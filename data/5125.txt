**Mood Disorders:** People living with mood disorders, such as major
depression or bipolar disorder, find that their mood affects both
psychological and mental well-being nearly every day for most of the day.

![Women just out of the shower.](/heartdisease/images/anxiety-disorders.jpg)

**Anxiety Disorders:** People respond to certain objects or situations with
fear, dread, or terror. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety, social
anxiety, panic disorders, and phobias.

![Female soldier leaving home.](/heartdisease/images/ptsd.jpg)

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** People can experience PTSD after
undergoing a traumatic life experience, such as war, natural disaster, or any
other serious incident.

![Man with his head in his hands.](/heartdisease/images/chronic-stress.jpg)

**Chronic Stress:** People are in a state of uncomfortable emotional stress--
accompanied by predictable biochemical, physiological, and behavioral changes
--that is constant and persists over an extended period of time.

*There may be other behavioral health disorders, such as substance use disorders, that are connected to heart disease.

## What is the connection between mental health disorders and heart disease?

A large and growing body of research shows that mental health is associated
with risk factors for heart disease before a diagnosis of a mental health
disorder and during treatment. These effects can arise both directly, through
biological pathways, and indirectly, through risky health behaviors.5

People experiencing depression, anxiety, stress, and even PTSD over a long
period of time may experience certain physiologic effects on the body, such as
increased cardiac reactivity (e.g., increased heart rate and blood pressure),
reduced blood flow to the heart, and heightened levels of cortisol. Over time,
these physiologic effects can lead to calcium buildup in the arteries,
metabolic disease, and heart disease.1,6-11

Evidence shows that mental health disorders--such as depression, anxiety, and
PTSD--can develop after cardiac events, including heart failure, stroke, and
heart attack.5,12-20 These disorders can be brought on after an acute heart
disease event from factors including pain, fear of death or disability, and
financial problems associated with the event.5,16

Some literature notes the impact of medicines used to treat mental health
disorders on cardiometabolic disease risk. The use of some antipsychotic
medications has been associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes,
heart attacks, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death.21

Mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression may increase the chance
of adopting behaviors such as smoking, inactive lifestyle, or failure to take
prescribed medications.5 This is because people experiencing a mental health
disorder may have fewer healthy coping strategies for stressful situations,
making it difficult for them to make healthy lifestyle choices to reduce their
risk for heart disease.5

head to indicate mental health disorders. The image is in the center of a
circle with arrows, illustrating the cyclical relationship between heart
health and behavioral health. Anxiety, depression, chronic stress, and post-
traumatic stress disorder, can lead to increased cardiac reactivity, like
stroke, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and heart
attack, which can lead back to assorted mental health disorders, and vice
versa. The possible behavioral pathways that can cause mental health disorders
include financial strain, antipsychotic medications, medication non-adherence,
smoking, and physical inactivity. The possible physiological pathways that may
result from mental health disorders include pain, fear, increased cardiac
reactivity, reduced blood flow to the heart, and increased
cortisol.](/heartdisease/images/mental-health-graphic.jpg)

## What groups have higher rates of heart disease from mental health
disorders?

Specific populations, such as the following, show higher rates of heart
disease as a result of pre-existing mental health disorders:

![Soldier at a support group meeting.](/heartdisease/images/veterans.jpg)

**Veterans.** Studies found that veterans are at a higher risk for heart
disease, mainly due to PTSD as a result of combat.22-26

![Two women talking.](/heartdisease/images/women.jpg)

**Women.** Studies exclusively focused on women found that PTSD and depression
may have damaging effects on physical health, particularly with increased risk
for coronary heart disease (CHD)-related morbidity and mortality.27,28

![A couple on vacation together.](/heartdisease/images/couples-ptsd.jpg)

**Couples with someone who has PTSD.** Comparative studies found that couples
where one or both partners had PTSD experienced more severe conflict, greater
anger, and increased cardiovascular reactivity to conflict discussions than
couples where neither partner had PTSD. Anger and physiological stress
responses to couple discord might contribute to CHD and heart disease risk
within these relationships.29,30

![Man working on a tablet at his desk.](/heartdisease/images/ethnic-
minorities.jpg)

**Racial and ethnic minorities.** Lastly, studies focused on racial or ethnic
minority groups found that depression, stress, and anxiety due to disparities
in social determinants of health,31 adverse childhood experiences,32 and
racism/discrimination33-35 could place certain subpopulations at a higher risk
for hypertension,32,33,35,36 cardiovascular reactivity,35 heart disease,31,34
and poor heart health outcomes.37

## What can be done for people with mental health disorders?

Addressing mental health disorders early by providing access to appropriate
services and support to increase healthy behaviors (e.g., increased physical
activity, improved diet quality, and reduced smoking) can reduce someone's
risk of experiencing a heart disease event.13,15,17,19,28,38-40

Below are some actions that health care systems, health care professionals,
individuals, and researchers can take to promote heart disease prevention and
support mental health.
