Bacteria called group A _Streptococcus_ (group A strep) can cause many
different infections. Some of these are common, relatively minor infections,
like strep throat. Others are less common, but very serious and even deadly.
People can easily spread group A strep to other people. Practicing good
hygiene, like washing your hands often, is the best way to protect yourself
from group A strep infections.
