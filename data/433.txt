## Summary

Stuttering is a problem that affects the flow of your speech. If you stutter,
you may

    * Make certain words sound longer than they should be
    * Find it hard to start a new word 
    * Repeat words or parts of words 
    * Get tense when you try to speak. You may blink your eyes rapidly, or your lips and jaw may tremble as you struggle to get the words out.

Stuttering can affect anyone. It is most common in young children who are
still learning to speak. Boys are three times more likely to stutter than
girls. Most children stop stuttering as they grow older. Less than 1 percent
of adults stutter.

Scientists don't fully understand why some people stutter. The problem seems
to run in families. There is no cure, but treatments can help. They include
stuttering therapy, electronic devices, and self-help groups. Starting
stuttering therapy early for young children can keep it from becoming a
lifelong problem.
