The U.S. CDC, located in Atlanta, Georgia, was designated a World Health
Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and
Control of Influenza in 1956. Since then it has played a leading role in the
global network. The network, now called the Global Influenza Surveillance and
Response System (GISRS), recently celebrated its 65th Anniversary. Visit CDC's
