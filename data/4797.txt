Equal Employment Opportunity is a set of laws, regulations, and policies that
guarantee every individual's right to equal employment opportunity in the
workplace, irrespective of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual
orientation, age, or disability.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all of these
laws. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal
employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.

Other federal laws, not enforced by EEOC, also prohibit discrimination and
reprisal against federal employees and applicants. The Civil Service Reform
Act of 1978 (CSRA) contains a number of prohibitions, known as prohibited
personnel practicesexternal icon, which are designed to promote overall
fairness in federal personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. 2302. The CSRA prohibits any
employee who has authority to take certain personnel actions from
discriminating for or against employees or applicants for employment on the
bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability. It
also provides that certain personnel actions cannot be based on attributes or
conduct that do not adversely affect employee performance, such as marital
status and political affiliation.

The Office of Personnel Management external icon has interpreted the
prohibition of discrimination based on conduct to include discrimination based
on sexual orientation. The CSRA also prohibits reprisal against federal
employees or applicants for whistle-blowing, or for exercising an appeal,
complaint, or grievance right. The CSRA is enforced by both the Office of
Special Counselexternal icon and the Merit Systems Protection Board external
icon.

_Additional information about the enforcement of the CSRA may be found on the
OPM web site at_Civil Service Reform Act of 1978external icon from OSC at
