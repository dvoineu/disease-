## Summary

Sexual assault is any sexual activity to which you haven't freely given your
consent. This includes completed or attempted sex acts that are against your
will. Sometimes it can involve a victim who is unable to consent. It also
includes abusive sexual contact. It can happen to men, women or children.

The attacker can be anyone - a current or former partner, a family member, a
person in position of power or trust, a friend, an acquaintance, or a
stranger.

Sexual assault can affect your health in many ways. It can lead to long-term
health and emotional problems. It is important to seek help if you have been
assaulted. First, get to a safe place. Then dial 9-1-1 or go to a hospital for
medical care. You may want to have counseling to deal with your feelings. The
most important thing to know is that the assault was not your fault.
