Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show
signs as the disease progresses.

Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart
muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can
affect people of all ages and races.

When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken,
stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not
belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump
blood is reduced, which can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood
into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure.

Cardiomyopathy can be acquired--developed because of another disease,
condition, or factor--or inherited. The cause isn't always known.

The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following1-4:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Dilated:** where one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Hypertrophic:** where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes.1 It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death.

It can occur with amyloidosis or hemochromatosis, and other conditions. This is the least common type.

### How common is cardiomyopathy?

Cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed,5 so the numbers can vary. As many as 1
of 500 adults may have this condition.6,7 Males and females of all ages and
races can have cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in blacks
than in whites and in males than in females.5

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to be the most common inherited or
genetic heart disease. While this type of cardiomyopathy occurs at many ages,
in children and young adults with this condition there may be no symptoms, yet
they are at high risk of sudden cardiac death.

### Causes

Although the cause of cardiomyopathy is sometimes unknown, certain diseases or
conditions can lead to cardiomyopathy. These include the following1-4:

### Treatment and Prevention

The goal of treatment is to slow down the disease, control symptoms, and
prevent sudden death. If you are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, your doctor
may tell you to change your diet and physical activity, reduce stress, avoid
alcohol and other drugs, and take medicines. Your doctor may also treat you
for the conditions that led to cardiomyopathy, if they exist, or recommend
surgery. Treatment also depends on which type of cardiomyopathy you have.

Genetic or inherited types of cardiomyopathy cannot be prevented, but adopting
or following a healthier lifestyle can help control symptoms and
complications. If you have an underlying disease or condition that can cause
cardiomyopathy, early treatment of that condition can help prevent the disease
from developing.

### Pediatric Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathy can occur in children regardless of age, race, and gender.
Pediatric cardiomyopathy can be inherited or acquired through a viral
infection and sometimes the cause is unknown. It is a frequent cause of sudden
cardiac arrest in the young, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute. Treatment may include medications, changes to physical activity, or
surgery.

In many cases, early detection and intervention can help to improve outcomes
for children.
