## Childhood Lead Poisoning Publications

**Note:** Most of these documents refer to a blood-lead level of 10 micrograms
per deciliter (μg/dL) as the CDC level of concern for adverse health outcomes
in children. This terminology is outdated and readers are referred to the
ACCLPP recommendations of 2012. However, the 2012 document does not recommend
changes to the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children
requiring chelation (BLLs ≥ 45 μg/dL) published here.

Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water--District of Columbia, 2004. _MMWR_. April 2, 2004; 53(12):268-270. **Addendum:** Following the release of the MMWR, "Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water -- District of Columbia, 2004", some reports have suggested erroneously that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that lead in residential tap water at concentrations as high as 300 parts per billion is 'safe'. CDC would like to reiterate the key message from the 2004 article that because no threshold for adverse health effects in young children has been demonstrated (no safe blood level has been identified), all sources of lead exposure for children should be controlled or eliminated. Lead concentrations in drinking water should be below the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 15 parts per billion.Read more about Lead in Drinking Water

**Lead Policy Statements:**

**Note:** These documents refer to a blood-lead level of 10 μg/dL as the CDC
level of concern for adverse health outcomes in children. This terminology is
outdated and readers are referred to the ACCLPP recommendations of 2012.
However, the 2012 document does not recommend changes to the guidelines for
the evaluation and treatment of children requiring chelation (BLLs ≥ 45 μg/dL)
published here.
