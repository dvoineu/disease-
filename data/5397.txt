Mucormycosis is a fungal infection of the sinuses, brain, or lungs. It occurs
in some people with a weakened immune system.

## Causes

Mucormycosis is caused by different kinds of fungi that are often found in
decaying organic matter. These include spoiled bread, fruit, and vegetables,
as well as soil and compost piles. Most people come in contact with the fungus
at some time.

However, people with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop
mucormycosis. These include people with any of the following conditions:

    * AIDS
    * Burns
    * Diabetes (usually poorly controlled)
    * Leukemia and lymphoma
    * Long-term steroid use
    * Metabolic acidosis
    * Poor nutrition (malnutrition)
    * Use of some medicines 

Mucormycosis may involve:

    *  **A sinus and brain infection called rhinocerebral infection:** It may start as a sinus infection, and then lead to the swelling of the nerves that stem from the brain. It may also cause blood clots that block vessels to the brain.
    *  **A lung infection called pulmonary mucormycosis:** Pneumonia gets worse quickly and may spread to the chest cavity, heart, and brain.
    *  **Other parts of the body:** Mucormycosis of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidneys. 

## Symptoms

Symptoms of rhinocerebral mucormycosis include:

    * Eyes that swell and stick out (protrude)
    * Dark scabbing in nasal cavities
    * Fever
    * Headache
    * Mental status changes
    * Redness of skin above sinuses
    * Sinus pain or congestion 

Symptoms of lung (pulmonary) mucormycosis include:

    * Cough
    * Coughing blood (occasionally)
    * Fever
    * Shortness of breath 

Symptoms of gastrointestinal mucormycosis include:

    * Abdominal pain
    * Blood in the stools
    * Diarrhea
    * Vomiting blood 

Symptoms of kidney (renal) mucormycosis include:

    * Fever
    * Pain in the upper abdomen or back 

Symptoms of skin (cutaneous) mucormycosis include a single, painful, hardened
area of skin that may have a blackened center.

## Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you. See an ear-nose-throat (ENT)
doctor if you are having sinus problems.

Testing depends on your symptoms, but may include these imaging tests:

    * CT scans
    * MRI scans 

A biopsy must be done to diagnose mucormycosis. A biopsy is the removal of a
small piece of tissue for laboratory examination to identify the fungus.

## Treatment

Surgery should be doneÂ right awayÂ to remove all dead and infected tissue.
Surgery can lead to disfiguration because it may involve removal of the
palate, parts of the nose, or parts of the eye. But, without such aggressive
surgery, chances of survival are greatly decreased.

You will also receive antifungal medicine, usually amphotericin B, through a
vein. After the infection is under control, you may be switched to a different
medicine such as posaconazole or isavuconazole.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Mucormycosis has a very high death rate, even when aggressive surgery is done.
Risk of death depends on the area of the body involved and your overall
health.

## Possible Complications

These complications may occur:

    * Blindness (if the optic nerve is involved)
    * Clotting or blockage of brain or lung blood vessels
    * Death
    * Nerve damage 

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

People with weakened immune systems and immune disorders (including diabetes)
should seek medical attention if they develop:

    * Fever 
    * Headache 
    * Sinus pain 
    * Eye swelling 
    * Any of the other symptoms listed above

## Prevention

Because the fungi that cause mucormycosis are widespread, the best way to
prevent this infection is to improve control of the illnesses associated with
mucormycosis.

## Alternative Names

Fungal infection - mucormycosis; Zygomycosis
