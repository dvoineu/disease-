Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI
can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems
but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.

### How Do I Interpret Body Mass Index Information?
