Assessment included clinical evaluation of each subject's medical and
psychiatric status, sleep characteristics and cognitive functioning.
Laboratory testing evaluated neuroendocrine status, autonomic nervous system
function, systemic cytokine profiles, peripheral blood gene expression
patterns and polymorphisms in genes involved in neurotransmission and immune
regulation. Evaluation was performed without knowledge of disease
classification.
