## Summary

Pneumococci are a type of streptococcus bacteria. The bacteria spread through
contact with people who are ill or by healthy people who carry the bacteria in
the back of their nose. Pneumococcal infections can be mild or severe. The
most common types of infections are

    * Ear infections
    * Sinus infections
    * Pneumonia
    * Sepsis
    * Meningitis

How the diagnosis is made depends upon where the infection is. Your doctor
will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history. Possible tests may
include blood, imaging, or lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Vaccines
can prevent pneumococcal infections. There are two vaccines. One is for
infants and young children. The other is for people at high risk, including
those who are over 65 years old, have chronic illnesses or weak immune
systems, smoke, have asthma, or live in long-term care facilities.
