## Summary

Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. Your doctor can prescribe
them for you. They work to balance some of the natural chemicals in our
brains. It may take several weeks for them to help. There are several types of
antidepressants. You and your doctor may have to try a few before finding what
works best for you.

Antidepressants may cause mild side effects that usually do not last long.
These may include headache, nausea, sleep problems, restlessness, and sexual
problems. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You should also let
your doctor know if you take any other medicines, vitamins, or herbal
supplements.

It is important to keep taking your medicines, even if you feel better. Do not
stop taking your medicines without talking to your doctor. You often need to
stop antidepressants gradually.
