### Environmental Health

![map icon for Montana](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/MT.jpg)

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community around you, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
affected negatively.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting public
health workers, educating communities, and providing scientific knowledge. We
help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a healthy
environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness caused by
environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might be
exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing healthcare costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

### Funded Activities

**National Asthma Control Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Montana--$308,000; A new funding announcement has been
released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the year.)

Asthma

About 84,000 Montana residents are living with asthma, including 9% of the
adult population and 7% of the state's children.

From: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/contacts/factsheets/Asthma-Montana_final.pdf

Asthma is a common disease on the rise, with significant health care costs.
Nearly 1 in 12 Americans (26 million) have asthma. In the last decade, the
proportion of people with asthma grew by nearly 15%.

CDC has been working with states for more than 10 years to implement
interventions, build coalitions, and track the impact of the disease on the
U.S. population.

Program activities focus on what works to control asthma: assessing and
measuring changes in disease severity and control, using the right
medications, educating people to manage their conditions, and controlling
environmental irritants and allergens.

Even though the number of people with asthma has increased over the last 10
years, trends show that more are controlling their disease:

**Lead Poisoning Prevention Program**

(FY 2011 funding for Montana--$492,000; because of funding reductions, the
program was discontinued in 2012. Some funding was restored in FY 2014. States
will be recompeting for funding and more information will be available later
in the year.)

More than 12 million U.S. children are exposed to lead in their homes at
levels which can harm their intellectual development. No safe blood level in
children has been identified.

Reducing children's lead exposure is perhaps the greatest environmental health
accomplishment in the past 20 years.

For more than 20 years, CDC funded state and local health agencies to:

Children who are exposed to lead lose $3,000 to almost $8,000 in lifetime
productivity for each 1 microgram per deciliter (μg/dL) increase in blood lead
level. Blood lead levels over 1 μg/dL are associated with measurable
reductions in IQ.

Between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, interventions that control or eliminate lead
hazards before children are exposed (primary prevention), helped reduce the
number of children exposed to lead by nearly 3 million (blood lead levels ≥
1μg/dL), saving $26-57 billion in lifetime productivity earnings alone. These
estimates do not account for behavioral and other adverse effects on lifetime
productivity linked to lead.

### Public Health in Action

**Asthma Control in Montana**

CDC has supported the implementation of Montana's resource guide, Creating
Asthma Friendly Schools in Montana since 2009. More than 600 school personnel
have received hands-on training in creating supportive environments for
students with asthma. In a survey conducted in 2011, 60% of school
administrators reported receiving a school-based asthma resource guide and 23%
reported receiving related training. Schools where administrators have
received training are significantly more likely to have asthma friendly
policies and practices in place.

In addition, the state asthma program is assisting hospitals to implement the
Asthma Hospital Patient Education, Action Plan, and Discharge (AHEAD)
Protocol. The AHEAD Protocol promotes the use of evidenced based care and
education to empower patients to better manage their asthma after a trip to
the emergency department. By August 2012, nine of Montana's 45 hospitals had
adopted the protocol.
