## Summary

Bell's palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects
just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst
about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and
include

  * Twitching
  * Weakness
  * Paralysis
  * Drooping eyelid or corner of mouth
  * Drooling
  * Dry eye or mouth
  * Excessive tearing in the eye
  * Impaired ability to taste

Scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become
inflamed. You are most likely to get Bell's palsy if you are pregnant,
diabetic or sick with a cold or flu.

Three out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without
treatment, most people begin to get better within 2 weeks and recover
completely within 3 to 6 months.
