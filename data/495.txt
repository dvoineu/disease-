## Summary

Chances are you've bumped your head before. Often, the injury is minor because
your skull is hard and it protects your brain. But other head injuries can be
more severe, such as a skull fracture, concussion, or traumatic brain injury.

Head injuries can be open or closed. A closed injury does not break through
the skull. With an open, or penetrating, injury, an object pierces the skull
and enters the brain. Closed injuries are not always less severe than open
injuries.

Some common causes of head injuries are falls, motor vehicle accidents,
violence, and sports injuries.

It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.
Get help immediately if the injured person has

    * A headache that gets worse or does not go away
    * Repeated vomiting or nausea
    * Convulsions or seizures
    * An inability to wake up
    * Dilated (enlarged) pupil in one or both eyes
    * Slurred speech
    * Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs
    * Loss of coordination
    * Increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation

Doctors use a neurologic exam and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment
depends on the type of injury and how severe it is.
