Background | Current asthma prevalence is an estimate of the percent of the
population with current asthma at the time of the survey. This measure is
available from NHIS beginning in 2001. The sampling methodology of the NHIS
prevents seasonal bias that could arise from asking the survey questions
during different times of the year. The NHIS is conducted throughout the year,
and throughout each region of the US during all seasons.

The NHIS prevalence questions are based on case definition from the Council of
State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) 1998 Position Statement(1). The
NHIS was redesigned in 1997, and from 1997-2000, there was no established
national point prevalence measure (see "asthma attack prevalence" definition).
Prior to 1996, a period prevalence measure was used and was based on the
question, "During the past year, did anyone in the family have asthma?" (2)  
  
Significance to disparities | Current asthma prevalence indicates the
percentage of each population subgroup that is theoretically at risk for
adverse asthma outcomes, such as asthma emergency room visits or
hospitalizations. Generally, current asthma prevalence is higher among
minority and low income populations of children(3). There are few primary
prevention measures that can be used to prevent asthma from developing, or to
address the disparity in asthma prevalence. Thus, the Federal Action Plan (4)
includes increasing primary asthma prevention research as one of its four main
strategies to address asthma disparities.

Background | In 2006-2010, 51.5% of persons with current asthma reported
having had an asthma attack in the past year (1). Having an asthma attack in
the past year can be a crude indicator of one's management of asthma. Children
with appropriate medical care and self-management should experience no or
minimal asthma symptoms (2, 3).  
Significance to disparities | In 2010, black children had an asthma attack
prevalence rate of 55.1 per 100 children and white children had a prevalence
rate of 62.7 per 100 children (4). A recent analysis of asthma disparities
between white and black children found that when using population based rates,
disparities in asthma attack prevalence widened over time. However, when using
at-risk rates, which account for differences in prevalence, there were no
differences between white and black children in asthma attack prevalence (4).
The authors concluded that even though there were no differences in asthma
attack at-risk prevalence rates between white and black children, current
asthma prevalence continues to increased among black children and racial
disparities remained in asthma and ED visit and death rates (4).

Background | Asthma ED visits are an indicator of poorly controlled asthma and
a risk factor for future exacerbations. (1) There are specific recommendations
for patient education and disease management to prevent ED visits, including
assessing inhaler technique, instructions for medication, steps to follow for
worsening symptoms, and referral for follow-up asthma care(1). Each year,
approximately 2 million ED visits related to asthma occur in the United
States(2). The cost of ED care is substantially higher than the cost of
outpatient and pharmaceutical services(1).

Healthy People 2020 Respiratory Disease Objective 3 (RD-3) is: Reduce
emergency department (ED) visits for asthma.

Emergency Department visit rate for asthma  
  
Significance to disparities | Among children 0-17 years of age, black children
had an asthma ED visit rate nearly 5 times higher than white children in 2010.
When only children with asthma are considered, black children with asthma had
about a 2.5 times higher asthma ED than white children with asthma(3).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * This indicator may be an overestimate of the burden of severe asthma exacerbations since people sometime use the ED inappropriately - i.e., using the ED for primary care. However, a study comparing asthma severity by race among children visiting the ED for asthma found similar levels of severity between black and white children(4).

Background | Asthma hospitalization represents a serious outcome that is
theoretically preventable with high-quality health care, patient education,
and optimal management of asthma. It also represent a risk factor for future
asthma exacerbations(1). Each year, approximately 480,000 hospitalizations
related to asthma occur in the United States.) Although inpatient
hospitalization for asthma is less frequently used than outpatient and
pharmaceutical services, its cost is substantially higher(4).

Healthy People 2020 Respiratory Disease Objective 2 (RD-2) is: Reduce
hospitalizations for asthma. (https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-

Background | Asthma deaths are a rare, but preventable outcome among children.
Predictors of asthma deaths include 3 or more asthma ED visits in the past
year, an asthma hospitalization in the past month, overuse of short-acting
beta agonist medication, an intensive care unit stay for asthma, lack of a
written asthma plan, and low socioeconomic status(1). The number of deaths
with asthma as the underlying cause declined steadily from 4,269 in 2001 to
3,388 in 2009, at a rate of 3.3% per year(1). Among children, the population-
based rate of asthma deaths per million was 2.8 in 2009, and the at-risk based
rate of asthma deaths per 10,000 children with asthma was 0.3(2).

Healthy People 2020 Respiratory Disease Objective 1 (RD-1) is: Reduce asthma
deaths. (https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-
objectives/topic/respiratory-diseases/objectivesExternal)

Significance to disparities | Although asthma deaths are rare among children,
racial disparities in asthma death rates are the largest compared to other
outcomes. In 2010, black children were 7 times more likely to die than white
children. Among children with asthma, black children with asthma were 4 times
more likely to die from asthma than white children with asthma(3). While there
were improvements in racial disparities for asthma hospitalization rates from
2001 to 2010, there was no improvement in racial disparities for asthma death
rates(3).

Every death is attributed to one underlying condition, based on information reported on the death certificate, and using international rules for selecting the underlying cause of death (World Health Organization defines as "the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury") from the conditions reported on the death certificate.

Background | In 2008, nearly 60% of children with current asthma reported
missing at least one day of school in the past 12 months (1). Children 5-17
years were reported to have missed 10.5 million school days in the past year
due to asthma (1). Missed school days can be used as an asthma measure of
morbidity because poor asthma control can lead to a loss of productivity
resulting in missed school days. Children with appropriate medical care and
self-management should not experience asthma symptoms or miss school because
of their asthma (2). The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
(NAEPP) provides expert guidelines for diagnosis and management of asthma
https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/resources/lung/naci/asthma-info/asthma-
guidelines.htmExternal. Healthy People 2020 goals (RD-5.1) aim to reduce the
proportion of children aged 5-17 years with asthma who miss school days
http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics- objectives/topic/respiratory-
diseases/objectivesExternal.  
Significance to disparities | An analysis of asthma disparities among
racial/ethnic groups in Passaic, New Jersey (1998-2001) revealed that black
and Puerto Rican children had a higher percentage of missed school days due to
asthma than white children or children in other Hispanic subgroups (Mexican
and Dominican) (3). Black and Puerto Rican children also had the highest
asthma prevalence.
