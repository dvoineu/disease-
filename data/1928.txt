### Search Tips

Default Behavior

By default, all searches are OR searches (you don't need to type in the OR
operator described below). This means when you search on one or more terms,
the results show publications that match any of your search terms.

PCOS ignores stop words, which are commonly occurring words and numbers that
are omitted when the search is processed (for example: the, for, a, an).
Ignoring these stop words helps with the speed of the search. Note: If you
want to include stop words in a search use the Exact Match operator below.

Advanced Search Operators

**Exact Match**  
Use quotes to search for an exact word or set of words.

Example: "the health consequences of smoking"

**AND**  
To search for publications that match all search terms, include AND between
the words. The results show publications that match all search terms. The
order of your search words does not matter.

Example: smoking AND report

**OR**  
To search for publications that may have one of several words, include OR
between the words.

Example: youth OR adult

**Using OR with AND**  
If OR is used in combination with AND, then it will replace AND.

Example: smoking and youth or adult

Note that since OR will replace AND, the search will be for: smoking OR youth
OR adult
