## Summary

Heel problems are common and can be painful. Often, they result from too much
stress on your heel bone and the tissues that surround it. That stress can
come from

    * Injuries
    * Bruises that you get walking, running or jumping 
    * Wearing shoes that don't fit or aren't made well
    * Being overweight

These can lead to tendinitis, bursitis, and fasciitis, which are all types of
inflammation of the tissues that surround your heel. Over time the stress can
cause bone spurs and deformities. Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis and gout, can also lead to heel problems. Treatments for heel
problems might include rest, medicines, exercises, taping, and special shoes.
Surgery is rarely needed.
