## Summary

If a woman loses a pregnancy after she's past her 20th week, it's called a
stillbirth. Stillbirths are due to natural causes. They can happen before
delivery or during delivery. Causes include:

    * Problems with the placenta, the organ that transports oxygen and nutrients to the fetus
    * Genetic problems with the fetus
    * Fetal infections
    * Other physical problems in the fetus

In at least half of all cases, it is not possible to tell why the baby died.

If stillbirth happens before delivery, your health care provider may induce
labor or perform a Cesarean section to deliver the fetus. In some cases, you
can wait until you go into labor yourself. This usually happens within two
weeks of stillbirth.

Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you do decide to try
again, work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many
women who have a stillbirth go on to have healthy babies.
