**Rebecca Martin, PhD, is the Director of the Center for Global Health (CGH)
at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).** Dr Martin has
worked both domestically and internationally in immunization, HIV, and health
system strengthening and now leads CDC's global efforts to protect and improve
health globally through science, policy, partnership, and evidence-based
public health action.

Dr. Martin has over 18 years of experience working in international health.
Since 1991, Dr. Martin has worked in the global health arena and has had CDC
assignments in Kenya, Tanzania, and Denmark (2002-2011). She was detailed to
the WHO African Regional Office from 2002-2006, based in Kenya as a senior
epidemiologist in the inter-country immunization program office for eight east
African countries. From 2006-2008, Dr. Martin served as Program Director for
Strategic Information and Human Resources for Health with the CDC Country
Office in Tanzania. She led and implemented studies, in partnership with the
ministry of health, to measure and evaluate the HIV/AIDS epidemic and
strengthen national capacity to respond.

Between 2008 and 2011, Dr. Martin was detailed to the WHO European Regional
Office as the Regional Advisor for Immunization where she spearheaded regional
efforts to strengthen immunization and surveillance systems, provide evidence
for the introduction of new vaccines, achieve the goal of measles and rubella
elimination, and maintain the region's polio-free status. Most recently from
2012 to 2016, Dr. Martin served as the Director of the CGH Global Immunization
Division, which leads CDC's global polio eradication efforts, accelerated
disease control for vaccine-preventable diseases, introduction of new and
underutilized vaccines, and the strengthening of immunization systems.

Dr. Martin began her career with CDC in 1997 in the National Immunization
Program, Epidemiology and Surveillance Division. Prior to joining CDC, she
worked at the Maryland Department of Hygiene and Mental Health in Baltimore
Maryland as the immunization program epidemiologist leading efforts to
increase vaccination coverage, conducting outbreak investigations,
coordinating the development and introduction of Maryland's immunization
registry, and supporting the state's Vaccines for Children Program.

Dr. Martin received her Doctorate of Philosophy from the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health in international health with a focus in
infectious disease epidemiology. Over the past 15 years, she has collaborated
with multilateral organizations and development partners and has worked
closely with ministries of health and non-governmental organizations. She has
co-authored manuscripts and developed strategic plans, normative guidance and
guidelines on immunization strategies, vaccine-preventable diseases and
surveillance methods for both immunization and HIV.
