\(OID\)](/about/images/leadership/leaders/oid.jpg)

**Jay C. Butler, MD** is the Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases. In this
capacity, he provides leadership to the efforts of CDC's three infectious
disease national centers and helps to advance the agency's cross-cutting
infectious disease priorities.

Dr. Butler has 30 years of experience in increasingly complex public health
leadership and management positions. He graduated from North Carolina State
University with a BS in zoology, received his MD at the University of North
Carolina, and did internship and residency training in medicine and pediatrics
at Vanderbilt. After completing CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service in the
Wisconsin Division of Health, Dr. Butler completed a preventive medicine
residency with the Respiratory Diseases Branch in the National Center for
Infectious Diseases, and an infectious disease fellowship at Emory University.
He is board certified in medicine, pediatrics and infectious diseases, and has
served in public health positions at federal, state, and tribal government,
including completing more than 22 years in the Commissioned Corps of the US
Public Health Service, from which he retired at the level of Captain (Medical
Director) in 2012.

From 1998-2005, Dr. Butler was Director of the Arctic Investigations Program
and from June 2009 to March 2010 he directed CDC's 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Vaccine
Task Force, which achieved emergency vaccination of more than 80 million
Americans. Dr. Butler made critical contributions to emerging infections,
including serving on the Hantavirus Task Force in CDC's Viral Special
Pathogens in 1993 and 1994. He held leadership roles in multiple emergency
responses, including CDC's response to bioterrorist anthrax in 2001.

Dr. Butler has also held multiple leadership roles in Alaska, including Chief
Medical Officer for the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services
(2014-2018 and 2007-2009), State Epidemiologist (2005-2007), and Senior
Director of the Division of Community Health Services for the Alaska Native
Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC)(2010-2014). He was President of the
Association of State and Territorial Health Officials in 2016-2017, and has
made important contributions to public health approaches to reducing harms
associated with addiction.
