## Summary

Herpes is an infection that is caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). Oral
herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face. Genital herpes affects the
genitals, buttocks or anal area. Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted
disease (STD). It affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. Other herpes
infections can affect the eyes, skin, or other parts of the body. The virus
can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.

There are two types of HSV:

  * HSV type 1 most commonly causes cold sores. It can also cause genital herpes.
  * HSV type 2 is the usual cause of genital herpes, but it also can infect the mouth.

HSV spreads through direct contact. Some people have no symptoms. Others get
sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into
blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal.

Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less
often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms
and decrease outbreaks.
