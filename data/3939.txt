## Overview

Colorectal cancer is the #2 cancer killer of both men and women in the US. But
colorectal cancer is a preventable disease. Colorectal cancer starts with a
precancerous polyp (abnormal growth) in the colon, which can be removed
without surgery. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults
of average risk begin screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. While
screening increases as people get older, national targets for screening have
not been met. Adults are likely to get screened when healthcare providers talk
to them about their options. Adults ages 50-75 should talk to their doctor
about when they should be screened.

### People in their early 50s delay getting their first colorectal cancer
screening test

Problem

##### Not starting screening at 50

**Question** : What if I don't have any symptoms?  
**Answer** : Colorectal cancer often doesn't cause symptoms early on.

**Question** : Is the test unpleasant or embarrassing?  
**Answer** : There are several kinds of tests that can be done in the clinic
or at home. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best option for you.

**Question** : Do I need to be screened if no one in my family had colorectal
cancer?  
**Answer** : Yes. Family history can put you at higher risk, but most
colorectal cancers happen in people with no family history.

If you're going to be 50 years old soon or if you're in your 50s now and
haven't been screened yet--don't wait to prevent colorectal cancer.

Take the time for your health. Talk to your doctor about the best test for you
based on your preferences--then get that test done.
