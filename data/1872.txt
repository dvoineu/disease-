## Summary

You may only think of tears as those salty drops that fall from your eyes when
you cry. Actually, your tears clean your eyes every time you blink. Tears also
keep your eyes moist, which is important for your vision.

Tear glands produce tears, and tear ducts carry the tears from the glands to
the surface of your eye. Problems with the tear system can include too many
tears, too few tears, or problems with the tear ducts. Treatment of the
problem depends on the cause.
