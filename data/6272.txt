Keeping backyard poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and turkeys) is
becoming more popular. People enjoy raising baby poultry including chicks,
ducklings, goslings, and poults. Many people keep chickens to have fresh eggs.
Although keeping backyard poultry can be fun and educational, owners should be
aware that poultry can sometimes carry harmful germs that make people sick.

These germs can cause a variety of illnesses in people, ranging from minor
skin infections to serious illnesses that could cause death. One of the best
ways to protect yourself from getting sick is to wash your hands thoroughly
right after touching poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam.

Whether you are building your first coop or are a seasoned backyard poultry
owner, you should know the risks of keeping poultry and the simple things you
can do to stay safe.

Follow the Healthy People and Healthy Poultry tips to keep yourself and your
flock healthy.

**Read below to learn about diseases that can be spread by poultry and visit
theHealthy People section to learn about staying healthy around backyard
poultry. **

Bird flu (Avian influenza)

Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by
influenza viruses. Some avian influenza viruses that primarily circulate in
animals have infected people on rare occasion. When influenza viruses that
normally circulate in animals cause an infection in people, this is called a
"novel" virus infection. Not all influenza viruses found in birds are known to
cause human infections.

**How it spreads:** Flu viruses are highly contagious. People can get infected
through contact with saliva, nasal secretions, and droppings (poop) from
infected animals. People also can get infected through contact with virus-
contaminated surfaces, poultry coops, pig pens, and supplies. Less often,
people can get infected by touching an infected animal and then touching their
own eyes, nose, or mouth.

**Who is at risk:** It is rare for avian flu to spread to people. Anyone can
get the flu, but children younger than 5 years of age, pregnant women, adults
65 years of age and older, and people with weakened immune systems are at high
risk for serious flu complications.

People who work closely with large numbers of birds, such as producers, are
more likely to get bird flu if their animals are infected.

**Signs in poultry:** Birds can be infected with flu viruses without showing
symptoms. Signs that poultry may be infected range from decreased egg
production to extremely high death rates.

**Symptoms in people:** People infected with avian flu viruses can have
symptoms similar to the human seasonal flu, such as fever, fatigue, lack of
appetite, and coughing. They may also have red eyes, nausea, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and vomiting. Some people can have serious flu complications,
including inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or
muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for
example, respiratory and kidney failure).

Campylobacteriosis ( _Campylobacter_ spp.)

 _Campylobacter_ are bacteria that can make people and animals sick with a
disease called campylobacteriosis.

**How it spreads:** _Campylobacter_ most often spread to animals and people
through the feces (poop) of infected animals, contaminated food, or the
environment. People can get infected if they don't wash their hands after
touching an animal or its poop, food, toys, habitats (including coops, pens,
and cages), or equipment used around these animals.

**Who is at risk:** Anyone can get a _Campylobacter_ infection, but children
younger than age 5, adults aged 65 and older, and people with weakened immune
systems are more at risk for serious illness.

**Signs in poultry:** Poultry usually don't show signs of _Campylobacter_
infection. Even if they look healthy and clean, poultry can still spread the
bacteria to people.

**Symptoms in people:** People can have diarrhea (can be bloody), fever, and
abdominal cramps. The diarrhea may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
Symptoms usually start within 2-5 days after infection and last about 1 week.

 _E. coli (Escherichia coli)_

 _E. coli_ are bacteria found in the environment, foods, and intestines of
people and animals. Although most kinds of _E. coli_ are harmless, others can
make people sick.

**How it spreads:** _E. coli_ most often spreads to animals and people through
the poop of infected animals, contaminated food, or the environment. People
can get infected if they don't wash their hands after touching an animal or
its poop, food, toys, habitats (including coops, pens, and cages), or
equipment used around these animals.

**Who is at risk:** Anyone can get sick from _E. coli_ , but children younger
than 5 years of age, adults 65 years of age and older, and people with
weakened immune systems are at risk for more serious disease.

**Signs in poultry:** Poultry naturally have _E. coli_ in their gut, and don't
usually show signs of illness. Even if they look healthy and clean, poultry
can still spread the bacteria to people.

**Symptoms in people:** Symptoms depend on the kind of _E. coli_ causing the
infection. Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) infection is one of the most
commonly diagnosed _E. coli_ infections in the United States. Symptoms of STEC
infection include stomach cramps (can be severe), diarrhea (can be bloody),
and sometimes vomiting or a low fever. Symptoms usually start within 3-4 days
after infection and last 5-7 days. Some people with STEC infection develop a
life-threatening complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type
of kidney failure.

Salmonellosis ( _Salmonella_ spp.)

Every year people get _Salmonella_ infections after handling poultry, such as
chicks and ducklings. Visit the Healthy People section for more information on
how to prevent becoming sick.

**Who is at risk:** Anyone can get a _Salmonella_ infection, but children
younger than 5 years of age, adults 65 years of age and older, and people with
weakened immune systems are more at risk for serious illness.

**Signs in poultry:** Poultry usually don't show signs of _Salmonella_
infection. Even if they look healthy and clean, poultry can still spread the
bacteria to people.

**Symptoms in people:** People may experience diarrhea, fever, and abdominal
cramps. Symptoms usually start within 6 hours to 4 days after infection and
last 4 to 7 days.

#### Handle eggs safely

Eggshells may become contaminated with _Salmonella_ and other germs from
poultry droppings (poop) or the area where they are laid. To keep your family
healthy, follow the tips below when collecting and handling eggs from a
backyard flock:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Always wash your hands with soap and water right after handling eggs, chickens, or anything in their environment.

Cleaning the coop, floor, nests, and perches regularly will help to keep eggs clean.

#### Prevent bird bites and scratches

Backyard poultry and waterfowl do not have teeth, but their bills and beaks
can still cause a lot of damage if they bite you. Germs can spread from
poultry bites, pecks, and scratches, even when the wound does not seem deep or
serious.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Avoid bites and scratches from your backyard poultry or waterfowl.

Though most poultry are quite gentle, some breeds are more aggressive and may be more likely to bite or scratch you.

Ask your veterinarian or local cooperative extension agent about the best food, care, and enclosure or environment for the poultry you are selecting.

Backyard poultry need a sturdy environment to protect them from organisms that spread disease such as insects and rodents and provide shelter from the weather and predators. The coop should be easy to clean.

Do not clean any items indoors, where the germs could contaminate your home.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Poultry can shed germs in their droppings (poop). Wear gloves when cleaning bird cages and poultry houses. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after contact with the poultry or their environment.

#### How to choose and introduce poultry

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Buy backyard poultry from hatcheries that participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Poultry Improvement Plan (USDA-NPIP)external icon. This program is intended to reduce _Salmonella_  in baby poultry in the hatchery, which can help prevent the spread of illness from poultry to people.

Poultry should have smooth, sleek, and soft feathers that are free of debris or droppings. Poultry that seem sluggish, aren't moving around very much, or look dirty may be ill.

This will help prevent the new poultry from passing disease to your flock. Remember that poultry can appear healthy and clean, but still spread harmful germs that make people sick.

For example, you can dedicate separate pairs of gloves, coveralls, and boots to each group, and you should wash your hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you go between the two groups.

#### How to house backyard poultry

Don't allow poultry or waterfowl inside your home for any reason, including
areas where food or drink is prepared, served, or stored, such as kitchens or
outdoor patios.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Provide your backyard poultry with a safe, sturdy environment outdoors, with housing areas and feeders/waterers that can be easily cleaned and disinfected. Poultry can be kept warm outdoors in the winter in a draft-free shelter or by using a safe heating source.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Once most of the debris is removed and the surface is generally clean, then apply the disinfectant. Dilute the disinfectant properly according to label directions before applying it. Most disinfectants only work on clean surfaces and don't work if they are applied directly to a dirty surface.

Then rinse and allow the surface to dry before reuse.

If you become sick shortly after buying or adopting a bird, tell your health care provider about your new animal and other animals that live in your household.

#### Practice biosecurity

Biosecurityexternal icon is the key to keeping your poultry healthy.
Practicing good biosecurity reduces the chance of your poultry or your yard
being exposed to diseases like avian influenza or Newcastle disease. These
diseases can be spread by people, animals, equipment, or vehicles, either
accidentally or on purpose.

The following steps are important in keeping your poultry healthy and having
good biosecurity practices:

_**Most people infected with _Salmonella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and
abdominal cramps 6 hours to 4 days after infection. Illness usually lasts 4 to
7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some people,
illness can be severe. Severe illness is more likely to affect children
younger than 5 years of age, adults 65 years of age and older, and those with
weakened immune systems.

Live poultry should not be kept in schools, childcare centers, and other
facilities with children younger than 5 years of age. If this is not possible,
the area where the chickens roam should be considered contaminated, and the
children should not be allowed to play, eat, or drink in these areas. The
chicken enclosure should be cleaned frequently. Children 5 years of age and
older should be supervised when interacting with chickens. They should wash
their hands (under adult supervision) immediately after handling the poultry.
In some states, certain animals, including live poultry, are prohibited in
childcare facilities pdf icon[PDF - 47 pages]external icon because of the
health risk. For more information, refer to the NASPHV Compendium of Measures
to Prevent Diseases Associated with Animals in Public Settingsexternal icon.

Yes, cats and dogs can get a _Salmonella_ infection and become sick. They may
also carry and spread the germ without showing signs of illness. Other
animals, such as reptiles, amphibians, rodents, and poultry, may also carry
and transmit _Salmonella_ without showing signs of illness. To reduce your
pet's risk of infection, do not let it play, eat, or drink in areas where
poultry roam.

Does thoroughly washing the produce reduce the risk of S _almonella_ , or should I keep the chickens out of the garden?  
**Thoroughly washing produce is always a good idea and can help reduce
(although not eliminate) the risk of S _almonella_ infection. Keeping chickens
out of the garden also helps reduce the risk of _Salmonella_ infection, as
does the practice of using chicken manure that has gone through the complete

It depends. There is risk of contamination of produce with germs if fresh
chicken manure is put directly on food gardens. Although you should not put
fresh chicken manure on your garden because of the risk of contamination,
using fully composted chicken manure in your garden is safe. The University of
Idaho offers information on composting chicken manure pdf icon[PDF - 6

Why?**  
If your family members properly handled chickens, including thoroughly washing
their hands after contact with chickens, their belongings, and habitats, they
greatly reduced their risk of illness.The true number of people who get
infected with _Salmonella_ through contact with poultry is likely
underestimated. That's because many people who get a diarrheal illness don't
link their illness to a known cause, such as contact with backyard chickens,
and many others do not get diagnosed with _Salmonella_ infection by a
healthcare provider. In addition, healthy adults may experience very mild
illness, thus, not realizing they may be infected.

There is some bedding in it but no poop. Is it a health risk?  
**Never wash your chicken's water dish in the kitchen sink. Food and water
bowls, tools, and other items used in the care of chickens should not be
washed or cleaned in places where you prepare or serve human food. That's
because of the risk of cross-contamination with _Salmonella_ and other germs
_._ Set up an area outdoors to clean and disinfect equipment used to care for
poultry.

I really don't want to remove any of the flock. Can I treat them with antibiotics?**  
CDC does not recommend giving antibiotics to live poultry is not recommended
to "treat" _Salmonella. Salmonella_ are found naturally in live poultry, and
the germ usually does not cause them to become sick. Giving antibiotics when
not medically necessary can result in antibiotic resistance. Before bringing
home live poultry, it is important to consider if they are right for your
family and check your local ordinances regarding ownership of poultry. If you
are unable to keep your flock, talk with the store or hatchery where you
bought the poultry to see about returning or rehoming them. You can also speak
with your local agriculture extension agent or poultry veterinarian for advice
and options for testing the flock.
