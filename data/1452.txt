##### ADHD Treatments For Preschoolers (ages 4-5)  
Be sure they get what's best!

##### Where we have been:

(Treatment practices, 2009-2010)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Almost 1 in 2 preschool children with ADHD got no behavioral therapy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * About 1 in 4 were treated only with medication.

##### Where we need to go:

(Treatment guidance, 2011)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Provide behavioral therapy first, before medication.

##### What can you do?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Parents:  
Talk to your doctor about behavioral therapy for your preschool child's
treatment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Healthcare professionals:  
Be aware of the psychological resources in your community and be prepared to
refer children, particularly preschoolers, for behavioral therapy as
recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
