Several different approaches have been used to estimate how many persons are living with FASDs in the population. FASDs include several diagnoses related to exposure of the baby to alcohol during pregnancy. More specifically, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most involved diagnosis, used when several physical and developmental abnormalities are present (see Facts about FASDs).

### Cost of FASDs

This is an average for people with FAS and does not include data on people with other FASDs. People with severe problems, such as profound intellectual disability, have much higher costs. It is estimated that the cost to the United States for FAS alone is over $4 billion annually. [Read summaryexternal icon]

### Key Findings: Alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant women aged
18-44 years - United States, 2015-2017

![Key Findings: Alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant
women](/ncbddd/fasd/images/Key-Findings-Alcohol-use-and-binge-drinking-among-
pregnant-women.jpg)

In a new _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report_ (MMWR) article, CDC
researchers **found that about 1 in 9 pregnant women reported drinking
alcohol* in the past 30 days.** Among pregnant women, about one third who
reported consuming alcohol engaged in binge drinking.†

Alcohol exposure during pregnancy can be harmful to the brain of a developing
baby and may result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Screening for
alcohol use, combined with brief counseling, may decrease alcohol use during
pregnancy and reduce the risk of FASDs and other negative pregnancy and birth
outcomes.

† Binge drinking was defined as having consumed four or more drinks on at
least one occasion in the past 30 days

### CDC Report: Screening for Alcohol Use and Brief Counseling of Adults - 13
States and the District of Columbia, 2017

![MMWR_Binge Drinking Linked IN](/ncbddd/fasd/images/MMWR_BingeDrinking-
Linked-IN-500px.jpg)

Binge drinking increases the risk for injuries, fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders, and some chronic diseases like breast cancer. This report found
that although 81% of US adults in 13 states and Washington, D.C. reported
being asked by their healthcare provider about alcohol use, only about 38%
reported being asked about binge drinking during a routine checkup in the last
2 years. Binge drinking is 5 or more drinks on an occasion for men and 4 or
more for women. Among adults who reported being asked about their alcohol use
at a checkup in the past 2 years and reported current binge drinking, 80% (or
4 of 5 persons) were _not_ counseled to reduce their drinking. Routine alcohol
screening and brief counseling has been shown to be effective at reducing
binge drinking and is recommended for all adults.

### Alcohol Use Data Sets

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS): This telephone survey
tracks national and state-specific health risk behaviors of adults, aged 18
years and older, in the United States. The BRFSS is administered and supported
by the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.

National Health Interview Survey (NHIS): The NHIS is a multi-purpose
nationwide household health survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized
population conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), CDC, to produce national estimates for a variety of health indicators.

National Survey on Drug Use and Healthexternal icon: This survey provides
information on the prevalence, patterns, and consequences of alcohol, tobacco,
and illegal drug use and abuse in the general U.S. population, 12 years and
older. It is conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administrationexternal icon.

Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI): This software, supported by CDC's
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, generates
estimates of alcohol-related deaths and Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL)
due to alcohol consumption.
