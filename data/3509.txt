This article describes the effects of a bite from the funnel-web spider. Male
funnel-web spider bites are more toxic than bites by females. The class of
insects to which the funnel-web spider belongs, contains the largest number of
venomous species known.

This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage a bite
from this type of spider. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call
your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be
reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline
(1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

## Poisonous Ingredient

The venom in the funnel-web spider contains the toxin.

## Where Found

Specific types of funnel-web spiders are found in southeast Australia, around
Sydney. Others are found in Europe, New Zealand and Chile. They are not native
to the United States, although some people may keep them as exotic pets. The
webs that are built by this group of spiders consist of funnel-shaped tubes
that extend into a protected space such as a hole in a tree or a burrow in the
ground.

## Symptoms

Funnel-web spider bites are very painful and dangerous. They have been known
to cause these symptoms in different parts of the body:

EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT

    * Drooling
    * Drooping eyelids
    * Double vision
    * Swallowing difficulty
    * Tingling or numbness in the mouth or lips within 10 to 15 minutes 

HEART AND BLOOD

    * Collapse (shock)
    * Rapid heart rate 

LUNGS

    * Difficulty breathing 

MUSCLES AND JOINTS

    * Joint pain
    * Severe muscle spasms, usually in the legs and belly area 

NERVOUS SYSTEM

    * Agitation
    * Confusion
    * Coma (lack of responsiveness)
    * Headache
    * Numbness of mouth and lips
    * Tremors (shaking)
    * Shivering (chills) 

SKIN

    * Heavy sweating
    * Redness around the site of the bite 

STOMACH AND INTESTINES

    * Diarrhea
    * Nausea and vomiting 

## Home Care

Funnel-web spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away. Call the
Poison Control Center or 911 for guidance.

Immediate treatment a bite consists of the following 4 steps, which are
modeled after the Australian snake bite treatment and consists of four steps:

    1. Clean the area with soap and water and Wrap the length of the bitten extremity with an elastic bandage.
    2. Attach a splint to the bitten extremity to immobilize the area.
    3. Keep the victim from moving.
    4. Keep the bandage in place as the victim is transported to the nearest hospital or emergency treatment center. 

## Before Calling Emergency

Have this information ready:

    * Person's age, weight, and condition
    * Time the bite occurred
    * Area on the body where the bite occurred
    * Type of spider, if possible 

## Poison Control

Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-
free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
They will give you further instructions.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in
the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any
questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an
emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## What to Expect at the Emergency Room

The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs,
including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The wound
will be treated as appropriate.

The person may receive:

    * Antivenin, a medicine to reverse the effects of the venom, if available
    * Blood and urine tests
    * Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)
    * Chest x-ray
    * ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
    * Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)
    * Medicines to treat symptoms 

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Funnel-web spider bites can be life threatening, especially in children. They
must be treated quickly with antivenin by an experienced provider. Even with
appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks.
The original bite may be small and may progress to a blood blister and look
like a bull's eye. (This is similar to the appearance of a brown recluse
spider bite.)

The area affected by the bite may become deeper. Additional symptoms such as
fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may
develop. Deep scarring may occur and surgery may be needed to improve
appearance of the scar.
