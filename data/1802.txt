Hantaviruses are a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause
varied disease syndromes in people worldwide.  Infection with any hantavirus
can produce hantavirus disease in people. Hantaviruses in the Americas are
known as "New World" hantaviruses and may cause **hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS)**. Other hantaviruses, known as "Old World" hantaviruses, are
found mostly in Europe and Asia and may cause **hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS)**.

Each hantavirus serotype has a specific rodent host species and is spread to
people via aerosolized virus that is shed in urine, feces, and saliva, and
less frequently by a bite from an infected host. The most important hantavirus
in the United States that can cause HPS is the **Sin Nombre virus** , spread
by the deer mouse.
