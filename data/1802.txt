## Summary

Every year thousands of people in the U.S. die from motor vehicle crashes.
Trying to prevent these crashes is one part of motor vehicle safety. Here are
some things you can do to be safer on the road:

    * Make sure your vehicle is safe and in working order
    * Use car seats for children
    * Wear your seat belt
    * Don't speed or drive aggressively
    * Don't drive impaired

Safety also involves being aware of others. Share the road with bicycles and
motorcycles, and watch for pedestrians.
