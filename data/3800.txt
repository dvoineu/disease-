belong to him, and recalls being disconnected and very frustrated. In the 8th
grade, Taylor took a pocket knife to school and was suspended. Since it was a
weapon, he had to go through the First Offender's Program and seek counseling.
The counselor noticed a gap between action, reaction, and consequences, and
had Taylor tested. Taylor was finally diagnosed with an FASD.

When Taylor was born, his birth mother had disclosed to the doctor that she
was dealing with alcohol dependence and drank alcohol while pregnant with
Taylor. This information from Taylor's parents was helpful to finally diagnose
him with an FASD. After Taylor's diagnosis, the Allen family finally connected
with NOFAS and the Kennedy Krieger Institute to get help for Taylor.

Some of the behaviors Taylor has struggled with include difficulty maintaining
attention, inability to plan and manage time, poor problem solving skills,
inability to learn from consequences, social awkwardness, anxiety, and
depression. Cathy Allen, Taylor's mother, shares that "Taylor has the outward
appearance of any other 23-year-old since he is on the high functioning end of
the spectrum, so his FASD behaviors are often misunderstood - causing Taylor
extreme anxiety and depression."

After a great deal of struggle and perseverance from Taylor and his family,
Taylor earned his associate's degree in electronics from a trade school.
Taylor currently works as a lead custodian at an area airport. He enjoys
playing and watching baseball, tinkering with computers, reading, and spending
time with his girlfriend of two years. Taylor hopes to further his education
and he is working toward living independently.

##### In His Own Words

"We were like so many other families out there. We were looking for guidance
and trying to find counselors, practitioners. Through NOFAS, I was able to
have a voice and speak out. By talking with others who are just at the
beginning of their FASD journey, we are also healing and helping ourselves -
by reminding us that we are not alone.

My mom talks to families that call her all the time. They are just trying to
get information, to understand, to have a shoulder to cry on. I hear these
conversations. They are so emotional that I walk by and listen in and I can't
help but tear up because I was there along with my dad and my mom. And I know
how it was like for my mom when she made that call to Kathy [Mitchell, Vice
President, NOFAS].

CDC would like to give a special thanks to the Allen family and the National
Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) for sharing this story with us.

Now, NOFAS has empowered me. Several times a year they give me the podium to
speak and tell my story. Getting up in front of a crowd to speak about FASD
takes away the control that this disability had over me. I didn't know why I
did a lot of things I used to do. But with this, I do know why I am doing it.
For the past year, I have been leading a teen group with the help of Kathy
[Mitchell, Vice President, NOFAS] and my dad. We mostly talk about what it's
like to be us, our day-to-day life, things we run into. We get into how bad it
feels to be misunderstood, how we just wish people would understand us. But at
the end of the day, no matter how bad, we are all smiles because we've got
together and met people just like us.

I want to thank NOFAS for letting us be a small part of everything they do. We
are going to keep talking, keep listening, and keep educating until everyone
in the world knows that you cannot drink during pregnancy."

###  Sasha's Story

Alexander "Sasha" Cook was adopted in 1997 at the age of five. Now at 23,
Sasha and his mother, Melissa, share his story in recognition of FASD
Awareness Day.

As a child and young teen, Sasha faced numerous difficulties. These included
learning problems, struggles with social relationships such as interacting
with classmates, difficulty with team sports since rules were too abstract,
and trouble handling everyday things in life. He still remembers that being
with his fellow students was "no fun."

Sasha had many evaluations and was diagnosed with multiple disabilities.
Knowing he was exposed to alcohol before birth is what helped his family and
doctors best understand his challenges. Typical milestones that other children
reached and took for granted seemed out of reach for Sasha.

**Coaching, Adapting, and Modifying Expectations**

Yet despite the odds and with support from his family, friends, church, and
school community **,** Sasha has come a long way. Sasha has shown great
potential, has many strengths, works hard, and clearly shows his resilience
and depth of character. "We did the majority of behavior modification at home
through structure and by understanding that this is not a moral disorder but a
brain-based disorder," explains Melissa.

"It is constant coaching, adapting, and modifying expectations for them,
realistically…. matching their potential with their gifts and strengths. As
parents, we are their external brain and our children who have FASDs can be
successful in a safe, structured, organized, and under-stimulated environment
that recognizes and builds on their capabilities in order to help through the
challenges."

Awareness Day.](/ncbddd/fasd/images/living-with-fasd_a250px.jpg)

Sasha with his mother, Melissa, and sister, Nadia, holding a proclamation
signed by the Governor of Georgia in 2013 declaring September 9 as FASD
Awareness Day.

**Employee of the Month**

Sasha successfully completed high school and has been gainfully employed by a
large national grocery chain since 2009. Over the years, Sasha has been given
additional responsibilities by his employer and was also recognized for his
willingness to help others. Sasha proudly shares details on the numerous
awards he has received and his growing customer service skills. "I was excited
to be Employee of the Month in January 2013 and now I've been promoted to work
the cash register. I like the people who I work with."

**Active Member of the Community**

Following in his mother's footsteps, Sasha is an active member of the
community. He understands his disability and helps bring support to others.
Recently, he participated and helped answer questions about FASDs at the 10th
annual Seminar Series for "Critical Issues Facing Special Needs and at Risk
Children" hosted by the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and
Developmental Disabilities, Suicide Prevention Program and The Supreme Court
of Georgia's Committee on Justice for Children.

Sasha also provided information about the National Organization on Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) Georgia chapter. NOFAS, a national nonprofit resource
of the FASD community, is committed to preventing FASDs and supporting
individuals and families living with FASDs.

As busy as Sasha stays, he still participates in fun activities including
playing the piano, playing tennis with the family, and participating in a
church bowling league. "Sasha is an excellent bowler and has crafted his
talent for five years," continues Melissa. "As a mother raising children with
FASDs, I have found that promoting physical activity through individualized
sports such as bowling, tennis, and ping pong are important tools to enhance a
child's daily functioning." Sasha is a very well-rounded young man and
receives great family support in all his endeavors.

Melissa would like to thank the FASD Communitiesexternal icon who have been
especially helpful to her and her family in the past few years.

CDC would like to thank Sasha and Melissa for sharing their story.

###  Melissa's Story

_This is the story of Melissa 's experience with alcohol use during pregnancy
and her journey to find the best possible care for her son._

![Melissa](/ncbddd/fasd/images/Melissa225.jpg)

"I drank at the beginning of my pregnancy; before I found out I was pregnant.
My doctor told me that it was okay to continue to drink wine during pregnancy.
He said I could have a glass of wine at night with dinner. He said it might
even help me relax and improve circulation. Not only did I think drinking wine
during pregnancy was okay, but I thought that it could be healthy. He never
asked me if I had a drinking problem, or how many drinks I have a day, or if I
binge drink. There wasn't any dialogue. I really wish that my doctor would
have had more dialogue or asked me questions about drinking alcohol during
pregnancy.

"When my son was born he looked perfect. He has amazing strengths. He's
brilliant and he's an amazing musician. However, as he got older I realized
that things just weren't quite right. He doesn't like how clothes feel. He
wore the same outfit for almost a year. I finally found a pair of socks that
he would wear. Then the company stopped making the sock. That wouldn't be a
big deal for most people, but it was a terrifying moment for me. We went
through about 25 packages of socks before we found a new brand that he would
wear.

"On his first day of kindergarten, the school called me because he had turned
over all of the chairs that people weren't sitting in, turned over items in
the kitchen area in the classroom, and thrown his shoes at the teacher.

"Most kids will get mad when they have to end play dates or sleepovers. But
instead of just getting mad, my son tried to jump out of the car the other day
because he had to leave a sleepover.

"When I finally realized what was going on, it was a relief, and it was
horrifying, and I felt guilty, and I felt ashamed. But mostly I felt relieved
to know what was going on.

"If a pregnant woman said to me, 'I drink a little bit here and there and I
was told it was okay,' I would tell her that she wouldn't if she had to live
just one day with the way that I feel about myself, knowing how my son has
been affected by my choices.

"I am angry that I was given wrong information about drinking during
pregnancy. I want to tell as many people as I can about it. You never know how
much alcohol during pregnancy is too much, so why take that chance?"

CDC would like to give a special thanks to Melissa and the National
Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) for sharing this story with us.

###  Frances's Story

![Frances sitting in a chair](/ncbddd/fasd/images/mystory_frances.jpg)

"FASD has affected my life in many ways. I was born six weeks early and
weighed three pounds, eleven ounces. As a child, I never knew what it was but
it was hard for me to make friends and I found myself feeling afraid of
others. School was very hard for me, especially math and English. I couldn't
comprehend them. I completed high school and tried college, but it didn't go
well. Then I got a job.

"Working was hard. I didn't know what I wanted to do and I went from job to
job. I couldn't hold on to a job. It was hard for me because I developed
anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. I still deal with that today. I
see a therapist often and take medication. It's still a struggle.

"I do a lot of writing to express my feelings. It helps me. I also watch
people very carefully to learn how to do certain things. I tend to read
everything twice to comprehend what I am reading. For my anxiety, I avoid loud
and crowded places. I always surround myself with people that I feel
comfortable and safe with.

"I got involved with an organization called Al-Anon because I grew up in an
alcoholic family. I do share my FASD story at the Al-Anon meetings. I always
tell myself if there is one young woman who is thinking about having a child
and who is drinking, if I share my story and that one person hears me, it's
worth it.

"I want people to know that there is hope. I keep telling myself, if I can
survive, others can too. FASD comes with a lot of shame and challenges. I
always tell people to stop and think before taking that drink. Pregnant women
should remember that they are not drinking alone."

CDC would like to thank Frances and the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol
Syndrome (NOFAS) for sharing this personal story.
