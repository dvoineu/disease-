## Summary

Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are procedures that let your doctor look inside
your large intestine. They use instruments called scopes. Scopes have a tiny
camera attached to a long, thin tube. The procedures let your doctor see
things such as inflamed tissue, abnormal growths, and ulcers.

Colonoscopy checks your entire colon and rectum. Sigmoidoscopy checks the
rectum and the lower colon only.

Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures

    * To look for early signs of cancer in the colon and rectum. It may be part of a routine screening, which usually starts at age 50.
    * To look for causes of unexplained changes in bowel habits
    * To evaluate symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss

Your doctor can also remove polyps from your colon during these procedures.

You will get written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the
procedure. The bowel prep cleans out the intestine so your doctor can see
everything clearly. During a colonoscopy, you get medicines to keep you
relaxed. You usually do not need them for a sigmoidoscopy.
