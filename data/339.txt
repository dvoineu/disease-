## Summary

If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.
Over time, this can damage your kidneys. Your kidneys clean your blood. If
they are damaged, waste and fluids build up in your blood instead of leaving
your body.

Kidney damage from diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. It begins long
before you have symptoms. People with diabetes should get regular screenings
for kidney disease. Tests include a urine test to detect protein in your urine
and a blood test to show how well your kidneys are working.

If the damage continues, your kidneys could fail. In fact, diabetes is the
most common cause of kidney failure in the United States. People with kidney
failure need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.

You can slow down kidney damage or keep it from getting worse. Controlling
your blood sugar and blood pressure, taking your medicines and not eating too
much protein can help.
