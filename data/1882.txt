#  Trigeminal Neuralgia

Also called: Tic douloureux, TN

## Summary

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It
causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. It usually affects one side
of the face. Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off.
The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the
longer you have it, the less often it goes away.

TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a
blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in
the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases
the cause is unknown.

There is no specific test for TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other
conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines,
surgery, and complementary techniques.
