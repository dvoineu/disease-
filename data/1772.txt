## Summary

Moles are growths on the skin. They happen when pigment cells in the skin,
called melanocytes, grow in clusters. Moles are very common. Most people have
between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time,
usually until about age 40. In older people, they tend to fade away.

Moles are usually pink, tan or brown. They can be flat or raised. They are
usually round or oval and no larger than a pencil eraser.

About one out of every ten people has at least one unusual (or atypical) mole
that looks different from an ordinary mole. They are called dysplastic nevi.
They may be more likely than ordinary moles to develop into melanoma, a type
of skin cancer. You should have a health care professional check your moles if
they look unusual, grow larger, change in color or outline, or in any other
way.
