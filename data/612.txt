## Summary

Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They
also can help find problems early, when your chances for treatment are better.
As a woman, you need some special exams and screenings. During your checkup,
your health care provider will usually do:

    * A pelvic exam - an exam to check if internal female organs are normal by feeling their shape and size.
    * A Pap test - a test to check for cancer of the cervix, the opening to a woman's uterus. Cells from the cervix are examined under a microscope.
    * A clinical breast exam - to check for breast cancer by feeling and looking at your breasts.

Your health care provider may also recommend other tests, including a
mammogram or a test for HPV.
