Ear discharge is drainage of blood, ear wax, pus, or fluid from the ear.

## Causes

Most of the time, any fluid leaking out of an ear is ear wax.

A ruptured eardrum can cause a white, slightly bloody, or yellow discharge
from the ear. Dry crusted material on a child's pillow is often a sign of a
ruptured eardrum. The eardrum may also bleed.

Causes of a ruptured eardrum include:

    * Foreign object in the ear canal
    * Injury from a blow to the head, foreign object, very loud noises, or sudden pressure changes (such as in airplanes)
    * Inserting cotton-tipped swabs or other small objects into the ear
    * Middle ear infection 

Other causes of ear discharge include:

    * Eczema and other skin irritations in the ear canal
    * Swimmer's ear \-- with symptoms such as itching, scaling, a red or moist ear canal, and pain that increases when you move the earlobe 

## Home Care

Caring for ear discharge at home depends on the cause.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if:

    * The discharge is white, yellow, clear, or bloody.
    * The discharge is the result of an injury.
    * The discharge has lasted more than 5 days.
    * There is severe pain.
    * The discharge is associated with other symptoms, such as fever or headache.
    * There is loss of hearing.
    * There is redness or swelling coming out of the ear canal. 
    * Facial weakness or asymmetry

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The provider will perform a physical exam and look inside the ears. You may be
asked questions, such as:

    * When did the ear drainage begin?
    * What does it look like?
    * How long has it lasted?
    * Does it drain all the time or off-and-on?
    * What other symptoms do you have (for example, fever, ear pain, headache)?

The provider may take a sample of the ear drainage and send it to a lab for
examination.

The provider may recommend anti-inflammatory or antibiotic medicines, which
are placed in the ear. Antibiotics may be given by mouth if a ruptured eardrum
from an ear infection is causing the discharge.
