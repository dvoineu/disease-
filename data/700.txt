## Summary

Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. Symptoms include severe
diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration. Almost all children in the U.S.
are likely to be infected with rotavirus before their 5th birthday.

Infections happen most often in the winter and spring. It is very easy for
children with the virus to spread it to other children and sometimes to
adults. Once a child gets the virus, it takes about two days to become sick.
Vomiting and diarrhea may last from three to eight days.

There is no medicine to treat it. To prevent dehydration, have your child
drink plenty of liquids. Your health care provider may recommend oral
rehydration drinks. Some children need to go to the hospital for IV fluids.
Two vaccines against rotavirus infections are available.
