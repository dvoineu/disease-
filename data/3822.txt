Rhinoplasty is surgery to repair or reshape the nose.

## Description

Rhinoplasty can be performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on
the exact procedure and the person's preference. It is performed in a
surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex
procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2
hours. It may take longer.

With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will
probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not
feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.

The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils.
In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This
type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a
cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend
around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the inside of the nose to
break, and reshape the bone.

A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This
helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft
plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps
keep the dividing wall between the air passages (septum) stable.

## Why the Procedure is Performed

Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be
used to:

    * Reduce or increase the size of the nose
    * Change the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge
    * Narrow the opening of the nostrils
    * Change the angle between the nose and the upper lip
    * Correct a birth defect or injury
    * Help relieve some breathing problems 

Nose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In
these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the
person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose
surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 14 or 15
for girls and a bit later for boys.

## Risks

Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:

    * Reactions to medicines, problems breathing
    * Bleeding, infection, or bruising 

Risks for this procedure include:

    * Loss of support of the nose
    * Contour deformities of the nose
    * Worsening of breathing through the nose
    * Need for further surgery

After surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots
on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no
visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the
procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the
nose that are not often visible.

In rare cases, a second procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity.

## Before the Procedure

Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may
need to:

    * Stop any blood thinning medicines. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines.
    * See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery.
    * To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery.
    * Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery.

## After the Procedure

You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery.

Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches
are common.

The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel
more comfortable.

The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Full recovery takes several weeks.

Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some
swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results
for up to a year.
