No two people with an FASD are exactly alike. FASDs can include physical or
intellectual disabilities, as well as problems with behavior and learning.
These symptoms can range from mild to severe. Treatment services for people
with FASDs should be different for each person depending on the symptoms.

### Early Intervention Services

There is no cure for FASDs, but research shows that early intervention
treatment services can improve a child's development. Early intervention
services help children from birth to 3 years of age (36 months) learn
important skills. Services include therapy to help the child talk, walk, and
interact with others. Therefore, it is important to talk to your child's
doctor as soon as possible if you think your child has an FASD or other
developmental problem.

Even if your child has not received a diagnosis, he or she might qualify for
early intervention treatment services. The Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA)external icon says that children younger than 3 years of
age who are at risk of having developmental delays may be eligible for
services. The early intervention system in your state will help you have your
child evaluated and provide services if your child qualifies.

In addition, treatment for particular symptoms, such as speech therapy for
language delays, often does not need to wait for a formal diagnosis.

### Protective Factors

![Girl being tutored](/ncbddd/fasd/images/girl-being-tutored.jpg)

Studies have shown that some protective factors can help reduce the effects of
FASDs and help people with these conditions reach their full potential.1
Protective factors include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Early diagnosis**  
A child who is diagnosed at a young age can be placed in appropriate
educational classes and get the social services needed to help the child and
his or her family. Early diagnosis also helps families and school staff to
understand why the child might act or react differently from other children
sometimes.

Children who receive special education geared towards their specific needs and
learning style are more likely to reach their full potential. Children with
FASDs have a wide range of behaviors and challenges that might need to be
addressed. Special education programs can better meet each child's needs. In
addition, families of children with FASDs who receive social services, such as
counseling or respite care have more positive experiences than families who do
not receive such services.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Loving, nurturing, and stable home environment**  
Children with FASDs can be more sensitive than other children to disruptions,
changes in lifestyle or routines, and harmful relationships. Therefore, having
a loving, stable home life is very important for a child with an FASD. In
addition, community and family support can help prevent secondary conditions,
such as criminal behavior, unemployment, and incomplete education.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Absence of violence**  
People with FASDs who live in stable, non-abusive households or who do not
become involved in youth violence are much less likely to develop secondary
conditions than children who have been exposed to violence in their lives.
Children with FASDs need to be taught other ways of showing their anger or
frustration.

### Types of Treatments

Several types of treatments are available for people with FASDs. They can

People with FASDs have the same health and medical needs as people without
FASDs. Like everyone else, they need well-baby care, vaccinations, good
nutrition, exercise, hygiene, and basic medical care. But, for people with
FASDs, concerns specific to the disorder must also be monitored and addressed
either by a current doctor or through referral to a specialist. The types of
treatments needed will be different for each person and depend upon the
person's symptoms.

Types of medical specialists might include:

#####  Medication

No medications have been approved specifically to treat FASDs. But, several
medications can help improve some of the symptoms of FASDs. For example,
medication might help manage high energy levels, inability to focus, or
depression.

Following are some examples of medications used to treat FASD symptoms:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Stimulants**  
This type of medication is used to treat symptoms such as hyperactivity,

This type of medication is used to treat symptoms of anxiety.

Medications can affect each child differently. One medication might work well
for one child, but not for another. To find the right treatment, the doctor
might try different medications and doses. It is important to work with your
child's doctor to find the treatment plan that works best for your child.

#####  Behavior and Education Therapy

Behavior and education therapies can be important parts of treatment for
children with FASDs. Although there are many different types of therapy for
children with developmental disabilities, only a few have been scientifically
tested specifically for children with FASDs.

Following are behavior and education therapies that have been shown to be
effective for some children with FASDs:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Good Buddies - A children's friendship training to teach individuals with an FASD appropriate social skills**1  
Children with FASDs often have difficulty learning subtle social skills from
their own experiences; those kinds of skills are typically "learned by
osmosis" on the playground, such as how to slip into a group, appropriate
sharing, or dealing with teasing. This intervention uses a group format to
teach age-appropriate social skills over 12 weekly sessions for parent and
child. Sessions are organized around and toward each child hosting a play date
with a classmate or peer.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Families Moving Forward (FMF) program to provide support for families who deal with challenging FASD behaviors**2  
This intervention is most appropriate for children with severe, clinically
significant behavior problems based in part on positive behavior support
techniques. It is a feasible, low-intensity, sustained model of supportive
consultation with a parent or caregiver (rather than directly with the child).
The intervention lasts 9 to 11 months, with at least 16 every-other-week
sessions, typically lasting 90 minutes each. Services are carried out by
mental health providers with specialized training.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Math Interactive Learning Experience (MILE) program to help with mathematics difficulty**3  
Deficits in mathematical functioning have been reported consistently among
alcohol-affected individuals. The MILE program is designed to improve the
child's mathematical knowledge and skill. Children complete 6 weeks of one-to-
one tutoring using specifically adapted materials (eg, vertical number line,
timers, etc.) that are appropriate to their academic level. Parents also
receive training on behavioral regulation techniques to optimize the child's
readiness to learn.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Parents and Children Together (PACT) a neurocognitive habilitation program to improve self-regulation and executive function**4  
Building upon techniques developed from the brain injury literature, this
intervention used 12 weekly sessions with parents and children to address and
improve behavior regulation and executive function (that is, planning,
organizing, and understanding of others). It uses a particularly engaging
metaphor of "how does my engine run" to teach children awareness of their
current behavioral state and specific techniques for optimizing that state for
the current situation.

#####  Parent Training

Children with FASDs might not respond to the usual parenting practices. Parent
training has been successful in educating parents about their child's
disability and about ways to teach their child many skills and help them cope
with their FASD-related symptoms. Parent training can be done in groups or
with individual families. Such programs are offered by therapists or in
special classes.

Families might need support from a family counselor or therapist. Parents
might also benefit from local support groups, in which parents of children
with FASDs can discuss concerns, ask questions, and find encouragement.

With any disability, injury, or medical condition, many untested therapies
become known and are promoted by informal networks. These therapies are
referred to as alternative treatments. Before starting such a treatment, check
it out carefully, and talk to your child's doctor. Your child's doctor will
help you weigh the risks and benefits of these therapies.

Some of the alternative treatments used for people with FASDs include:
