Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to approximately 41,000 deaths among
nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year. Secondhand smoke causes
stroke, lung cancer, and coronary heart disease in adults. Children who are
exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death
syndrome, acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease, more severe
asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth.
