## Summary

Palliative care is treatment of the discomfort, symptoms, and stress of
serious illness. It provides relief from distressing symptoms including

    * Pain
    * Shortness of breath
    * Fatigue
    * Constipation
    * Nausea
    * Loss of appetite
    * Problems with sleep

It can also help you deal with the side effects of the medical treatments
you're receiving.

Hospice care, care at the end of life, always includes palliative care. But
you may receive palliative care at any stage of an illness. The goal is to
make you comfortable and improve your quality of life.
