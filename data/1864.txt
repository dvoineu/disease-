## Summary

Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow
in the brain and other organs. Symptoms vary, depending on where the tumors
grow. They could include

    * Skin problems, such as light patches and thickened skin
    * Seizures
    * Behavior problems
    * Intellectual disabilities
    * Kidney problems

Some people have signs of tuberous sclerosis at birth. In others it can take
time for the symptoms to develop. The disease can be mild, or it can cause
severe disabilities. In rare cases, tumors in vital organs or other symptoms
can be life-threatening.

Tuberous sclerosis has no cure, but treatments can help symptoms. Options
include medicines, educational and occupational therapy, surgery, or surgery
to treat specific complications.
