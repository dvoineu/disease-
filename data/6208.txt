# Example: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Decontamination of an
Ambulance that has Transported a Person under Investigation or Patient with
Confirmed Ebola

Purpose

This SOP can serve as a model for emergency medical services (EMS) transport
agencies to standardize the procedures and responsibilities for the
decontamination and disinfection of an ambulance that has transported a person
under investigation (PUI) for Ebola or a patient with confirmed Ebola. It is
highly recommended that procedures and responsibilities for decontamination
and disinfection of the ambulance be clearly defined before transporting a
PUI. All personnel should be trained in donning and doffing (putting on and
taking off) techniques for personnel protective equipment (PPE).

The following key assumptions are being made:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * All healthcare workers (hospital and out-of-hospital) who are involved will have received education and training and demonstrated the necessary competencies for management of patients with serious communicable diseases.

## Safety

Ebola is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, so infection
control measures must be implemented that prevent contact with blood or
infectious body fluid throughout the decontamination process.

This process is designed for a 3-person team. Two people will be donned in PPE
and perform the decontamination. A third person, not donned in PPE, will be
available to document the decontamination and for other assistance as needed.

## Decontamination Site Setup

## Transport Unit Decontamination

Note: All disinfection should use a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)-registered hospital disinfectantexternal icon with a label claim for a
non-enveloped virus (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) to
disinfect environmental surfaces at appropriate concentration and contact

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * To limit the number of people exposed to potentially contaminated materials, the vehicle operator and patient care provider may be responsible for decontamination and disinfection of the transport unit. However, a separate team may also be used to do this.

If the equipment was removed from a protective bag in transit, assess the equipment to determine if it can be properly decontaminated and disinfected, or disposed of.

However, these should not replace the manual disinfection, as their efficacy against organisms in body fluids has not been fully established and these methods may require specialized equipment and PPE.

[1] The hot zone is considered an area that is known or suspected to be
contaminated and has a high risk of exposure. It should only be entered with
full PPE. In ambulance decontamination, this would be the vehicle and an area
about a meter beyond the ambulance.

The warm zone can be considered a transitional area between the hot and cold
zones that has no known contamination but has a moderate risk of exposure. It
should only be entered when wearing full PPE. This is also the area where one
begins the initial portion of the doffing process (following a full suit wipe
down within the hot zone) when leaving the hot zone. For ambulance
decontamination, the warm zone can also be the place where waste barrels are
pre-positioned so that the waste bags can be placed directly into the
containers without entering the hot zone.

The cold zone is considered an area that has no contamination and no potential
risk for exposure. The individuals in this area are not required to wear PPE,
although the cold zone will often also serve as the PPE donning area.
