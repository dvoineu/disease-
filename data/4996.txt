Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a group of problems that occur in a
newborn who was exposed to addictive opiate drugs while in the mother's womb.

## Causes

NAS may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, codeine,
oxycodone (Oxycontin), methadone, or buprenorphine.

These and other substances pass through the placenta that connects the baby to
its mother in the womb. The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the
mother.

If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before
delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is
no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the
drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.

Withdrawal symptoms also may occur in babies exposed to alcohol,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs) while in
the womb.

Babies of mothers who use other addictive drugs (nicotine, amphetamines,
cocaine, marijuana,) may have long-term problems. While there is no clear
evidence of a NAS for other drugs, they may contribute to the severity of a
baby's NAS symptoms.

## Symptoms

The symptoms of NAS depend on:

    * The type of drug the mother used
    * How the body breaks down and clears the drug (influenced by genetic factors)
    * How much of the drug she was taking
    * How long she used the drug
    * Whether the baby was born full-term or early (premature) 

Symptoms often begin within 1 to 3 days after birth, but may take up to a week
to appear. Because of this, the baby will most often need to stay in the
hospital for observation and monitoring for up to a week.

Symptoms may include:

    * Blotchy skin coloring (mottling)
    * Diarrhea
    * Excessive crying or high-pitched crying
    * Excessive sucking
    * Fever
    * Hyperactive reflexes
    * Increased muscle tone
    * Irritability
    * Poor feeding
    * Rapid breathing
    * Seizures
    * Sleep problems
    * Slow weight gain
    * Stuffy nose, sneezing
    * Sweating
    * Trembling (tremors)
    * Vomiting 

## Exams and Tests

Many other conditions can produce the same symptoms as NAS. To help make a
diagnosis, the health care provider will ask questions about the mother's drug
use. The mother may be asked about which drugs she took during pregnancy, and
when she last took them. The mother's urine may be screened for drugs as well.

Tests that may be done to help diagnose withdrawal in a newborn include:

    * NAS scoring system, which assigns points based on each symptom and its severity. The infant's score can help determine treatment.
    * Toxicology (drug) screen of urine and of first bowel movements (meconium). A small piece of the umbilical cord may also be used for drug screening. 

## Treatment

Treatment depends on:

    * The drug involved
    * The infant's overall health and abstinence scores
    * Whether the baby was born full-term or premature 

The health care team will watch the newborn carefully for up to a week (or
more depending on the drug) after birth for signs of withdrawal, feeding
problems, and weight gain. Babies who vomit or who are very dehydrated may
need to get fluids through a vein (IV).

Infants with NAS are often fussy and hard to calm. Tips to calm the infant
down include measures often referred to as "TLC" (tender loving care):

    * Gently rocking the child
    * Reducing noise and lights
    * Swaddling the baby in a blanket 

Some babies with severe symptoms need medicines such as methadone or morphine
to treat withdrawal symptoms. These babies may need to stay in the hospital
for weeks or months after birth. The goal of treatment is to prescribe the
infant a drug similar to the one the mother used during pregnancy and slowly
decrease the dose over time. This helps wean the baby off the drug and
relieves some withdrawal symptoms.

If the symptoms are severe, such as if other drugs were used, a second
medicine such as phenobarbital or clonidine may be added. Breastfeeding may
also be helpful if the mother is in a methadone or buprenorphine treatment
program without other drug use.

Babies with this condition often have severe diaper rash or other areas of
skin breakdown. This requires treatment with special ointment or cream.

Babies may also have problems with feeding or slow growth. These problems may
require:

    * Higher-calorie feedings that provide greater nutrition
    * Smaller feedings given more often 

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Treatment helps relieve symptoms of withdrawal. Even after medical treatment
for NAS is over and babies leave the hospital, they may need extra "TLC" for
weeks or months.

## Possible Complications

Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to many health problems in the
baby besides NAS. These may include:

    * Birth defects
    * Low birth weight
    * Premature birth
    * Small head circumference
    * Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
    * Problems with development and behavior

NAS treatment can last from 1 week to 6 months. Even after medical treatment
for NAS is over and babies leave the hospital, they may need extra "TLC" for
weeks or months.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Make sure your provider knows about all the drugs you take during pregnancy.

Call your provider if your baby has symptoms of NAS.

## Prevention

Discuss all medicines, and alcohol and tobacco use with your provider.

Ask your provider for help as soon as possible if you are:

    * Using drugs non-medically
    * Using drugs not prescribed to you
    * Using alcohol or tobacco 

If you are already pregnant and take medicines or drugs not prescribed to you,
talk to your provider about the best way to keep you and the baby safe. Some
medicines should not be stopped without medical supervision, or harm may
result. Your provider will know how best to manage the risks.
