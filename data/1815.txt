## Summary

When you're dizzy, you may feel lightheaded, woozy, or disoriented. If you
feel like you or the room are spinning, you have vertigo. These feelings may
make you lose your balance.

Dizziness can have many different causes. A sudden drop in blood pressure or
being dehydrated can make you dizzy. Many people feel lightheaded if they get
up too quickly from sitting or lying down. Certain medicines and problems with
your inner ear may cause dizziness. So can motion sickness. Sometimes
dizziness can be a symptom of other disorders.

As people get older, they may have more health problems and take more
medicines. This makes them more likely to have problems with dizziness and
balance.

Dizziness usually gets better by itself or is easily treated. If you are dizzy
often, you should see your health care provider to find the cause.
