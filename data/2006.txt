## Summary

Your peritoneum is the tissue that lines your abdominal wall and covers most
of the organs in your abdomen. A liquid, peritoneal fluid, lubricates the
surface of this tissue.

Disorders of the peritoneum are not common. They include

    * Peritonitis - an inflammation of the peritoneum
    * Cancer
    * Complications from peritoneal dialysis

Your doctor may use imaging tests or lab tests to analyze the peritoneal fluid
to diagnose the problem. Treatment of peritoneal disorders depends on the
cause.
