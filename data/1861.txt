## Summary

Nutritional support is therapy for people who cannot get enough nourishment by
eating or drinking. You may need it if you

    * Can't swallow
    * Have problems with your appetite
    * Are severely malnourished
    * Can't absorb nutrients through your digestive system

You receive nutritional support through a needle or catheter placed in your
vein or with a feeding tube, which goes into your stomach.
