## Summary

Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes
that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls
of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and
they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating.
When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air.

Symptoms of asthma include

  * Wheezing
  * Coughing, especially early in the morning or at night
  * Chest tightness
  * Shortness of breath

Not all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms
doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma
based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You
may also have allergy tests.

When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma
attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be
fatal.

Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop
asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.
