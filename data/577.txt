#  Acupuncture

## Summary

Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for
thousands of years. Acupuncture involves stimulating specific points on the
body. This is most often done by inserting thin needles through the skin, to
cause a change in the physical functions of the body.

Research has shown that acupuncture reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery
and chemotherapy. It can also relieve pain. Researchers don't fully understand
how acupuncture works. It might aid the activity of your body's pain-killing
chemicals. It also might affect how you release chemicals that regulate blood
pressure and flow.
