## Summary

A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a
weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen.

There are several types of hernias, including

    * Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type.
    * Umbilical, around the belly button
    * Incisional, through a scar
    * Hiatal, a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest.
    * Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery

Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children. A combination of
muscle weakness and straining, such as with heavy lifting, might contribute.
Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get
a hernia.

Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall.
Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.
