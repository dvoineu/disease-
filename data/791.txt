                                  * Kelly M. Winter for serving in the role of managing editor and guiding this edition through the first half of production.

#### Preface

To stay on the cutting edge of travel health information, this latest edition
of the _CDC Yellow Book: Health Information for International Travel_ has been
extensively revised. The book serves as a guide to the practice of travel
medicine, as well as the authoritative source of US government recommendations
for immunizations and prophylaxis for foreign travel. As international travel
continues to become more common in the lives of US residents, having at least
a basic understanding of the medical problems that travelers face has become a
necessary aspect of practicing medicine. The goal of this book is to be a
comprehensive resource for clinicians to find the answers to their travel
health-related questions.
