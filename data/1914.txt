## Summary

An injury is damage to your body. It is a general term that refers to harm
caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and more. In the U.S., millions of
people injure themselves every year. These injuries range from minor to life-
threatening. Injuries can happen at work or play, indoors or outdoors, driving
a car, or walking across the street.

Wounds are injuries that break the skin or other body tissues. They include
cuts, scrapes, scratches, and punctured skin. They often happen because of an
accident, but surgery, sutures, and stitches also cause wounds. Minor wounds
usually aren't serious, but it is important to clean them. Serious and
infected wounds may require first aid followed by a visit to your doctor. You
should also seek attention if the wound is deep, you cannot close it yourself,
you cannot stop the bleeding or get the dirt out, or it does not heal.

Other common types of injuries include

    * Animal bites
    * Bruises
    * Burns
    * Dislocations
    * Electrical injuries
    * Fractures (broken bones)
    * Sprains and strains
