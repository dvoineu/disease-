## Summary

If you've ever groaned, "Oh, my aching back!", you are not alone. Back pain is
one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some
point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a
sudden, sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a
few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than
three months.

Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-
the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for
more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse.

If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days, you should
call your health care provider. You should also get medical attention if you
have back pain following an injury.

Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is
causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections,
complementary treatments, and sometimes surgery.
