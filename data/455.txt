## Summary

Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it's safer than smoking. But
you don't have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping
carries risks like

    * Cancer of the mouth
    * Decay of exposed tooth roots
    * Pulling away of the gums from the teeth
    * White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer

Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the
mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers, heart disease and stroke.

Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly
addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having
a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.
