## Summary

A lung transplant removes a person's diseased lung and replaces it with a
healthy one. The healthy lung comes from a donor who has died. Some people get
one lung during a transplant. Other people get two.

Lung transplants are used for people who are likely to die from lung disease
within 1 to 2 years. Their conditions are so severe that other treatments,
such as medicines or breathing devices, no longer work. Lung transplants most
often are used to treat people who have severe

    * COPD 
    * Cystic fibrosis
    * Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
    * Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
    * Pulmonary hypertension

Complications of lung transplantation include rejection of the transplanted
lung and infection.
