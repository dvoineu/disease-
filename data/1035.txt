![STD 101 in a Box](/std/training/std101/std-101-2011.gif)

This resource is based on **_STD 101_** , a workshop at the 2014 National STD
Prevention Conference in Atlanta, GA. The workshop provided participants who
had little or no STD Prevention experience a basic knowledge of STD Prevention
so that they could actively participate in the conference. **The purpose of
STD 101 in a Box** is to provide users with materials so that they may develop
similar workshops. The downloadable materials may be customized for
conferences, group discussions, and presentations.

Topics include STD clinical and behavioral information, HIV/STD inter-
relationship, STD epidemiology, and STD prevention program information.
Potential users may include, but are not limited to, community-based
organizations, public health departments, schools of public health, health
educators, primary care providers, and Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS).

All materials provided are in the public domain. These materials may be
reproduced without permission. You are also free to adapt and revise these
materials to meet the needs of your organization; however, you must remove the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) name and logo if changes are made.
