Loiasis, called African eye worm by most people, is caused by the parasitic
worm _Loa loa_. It is passed on to humans through the repeated bites of
deerflies (also known as mango flies or mangrove flies) of the genus
_Chrysops_. The flies that pass on the parasite breed in certain rain forests
of West and Central Africa. Infection with the parasite can also cause
repeated episodes of itchy swellings of the body known as Calabar swellings.
Knowing whether someone has a _Loa loa_ infection has become more important in
Africa because the presence of people with _Loa loa_ infection has limited
programs to control or eliminate onchocerciasis (river blindness) and
lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis). There may be more than 29 million people
who are at risk of getting loaisis in affected areas of Central and West
Africa.
