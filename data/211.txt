## Summary

Bereavement is the period of grief and mourning after a death. When you
grieve, it's part of the normal process of reacting to a loss. You may
experience grief as a mental, physical, social or emotional reaction. Mental
reactions can include anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness and despair. Physical
reactions can include sleeping problems, changes in appetite, physical
problems or illness.

How long bereavement lasts can depend on how close you were to the person who
died, if the person's death was expected and other factors. Friends, family
and faith may be sources of support. Grief counseling or grief therapy is also
helpful to some people.
