CommunityFlu is a software program that simulates the spread of influenza
through a model community, and the impact of a variety of potential
interventions (e.g., vaccinations, school closings, wearing of face masks,
patient and household isolation/self quarantine). CommunityFlu also calculates
the cost, in terms of workdays lost, of influenza and the associated
interventions.

###  What type of mathematical model is CommunityFlu?

CommunityFlu is an "individual agent" model, which means that it tracks, on a
daily basis, the transmission of influenza among each individual person that
populates a representative community. CommunityFlu tracks, for each person,
their daily contacts in a variety of locales such as home, school, and
workplace. Each contact represents a chance for the disease to spread from an
infectious person to a disease susceptible person. The representative
community comprises approximately 1,000 households with 2,500 persons. Each
person in CommunityFlu's community belongs to a household or a long term care
facility. Depending upon age, a member can attend a daycare center, school, or
workplace. School age children in the CommunityFlu community, for example, may
attend one of four elementary schools, two middle schools, or one high school.

###  Who should use CommunityFlu?

CommunityFlu is designed to enable public health officials, policy makers, and
students of infectious diseases to examine the spread of influenza pandemic
through a community. It is also designed to be used by persons who are
interested in producing simulations regarding the spread of influenza and the
impact of using specific interventions. We believe that a person with
intermediate computer spreadsheet skills can readily use CommunityFlu. There
is no need for programming skills or experience. A user interacts with
CommunityFlu solely through the spreadsheet portion of the program.

###  What does CommunityFlu produce?

CommunityFlu allows users to model the potential impact of using a variety of
interventions (e.g. vaccinations, school closings, wearing face masks, and
patient isolation) either singularly or in combinations that could reduce the
spread of illness. CommunityFlu provides the user with estimates for the
number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that may be seen among different
age groups found in a representative community. CommunityFlu also allows a
user to estimate the economic impact, in terms of days of work lost, of an
influenza epidemic/pandemic in a community (e.g., a metropolitan area, state),
thus calculating the savings and costs associated with one or more
interventions.

###  How does the Model run simulations?

CommunityFlu is programmed to run 50 simulations per one cycle run. On most
desktop or laptop computers (See "System Requirements" below), 50 simulations
(1 cycle run) should take less than 5 minutes. A user first runs a set of 50
simulations for the baseline situation "no intervention", and then runs
another set of 50 simulations to model the impact of any intervention(s)
selected by the user.

###  How does the user enter data into CommunityFlu?

There are approximately a total of 320 individual input values found in
CommunityFlu. A user can choose to either use the default values shown or they
can change any of the values that are displayed in the white text boxes
throughout the software. The default input values that define the transmission
of influenza in the representative community are taken from Haber et.al.
(Emerging Infectious Disease 2007; 13:581-589). At a minimum, a user must
define what interventions they wish to model.

###  What type of output does CommunityFlu produce?

CommunityFlu produces results that are presented in a series of tables and
graphs; which the user can cut-and-paste into presentations and/or reports as
needed. The graphs and tables are designed to allow a direct comparison of
simulated influenza epidemic/pandemic data with and without user-selected
interventions.

###  System Requirements

The CommunityFlu software program requires the use of the Windows* operating
system (Microsoft Windows XP) and the Excel program (Microsoft Office 2003 or
higher). CommunityFlu was initially developed using Microsoft Excel 2003;
however it is now being used with more recent versions of Microsoft Excel
(i.e., versions 2007 and the newly converted 2010 edition). We recommend using
a computer that has at least a processor with a minimum of 1GB of RAM
(operating memory), a 2.5 GHZ speed, and at least 15 MB of free storage memory
on the computer's hard drive. CommunityFlu may run slower on machines with
slower processors and on older versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 2000).

We have successfully loaded and run CommunityFlu on a variety of desktop and
laptop computers using the Windows operating system. CommunityFlu is not
designed to run on Apple* or machines that use other operating systems such as
Linux*.

###  Help Features

On each page of CommunityFlu you will see Help buttons. These buttons, when
clicked, will provide pop-up windows containing explanations of the input data
for that page, definitions of inputs and outputs, comments as to what values
need to be entered, and how to interpret the results. There is also an
extensive User Manual and a Quick Start Tutorial.

We have ran and tested CommunityFlu on various Excel versions ('97, '00, '03,
'07, and '10). While all versions perform the same function, we have noticed
that CommunityFlu does not always run smoothly in Excel 2010. The following is
a list of helpful hints that could assist you in running the software in the
Excel 2010 version:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. When saving the inter_call file in Excel 2010, different file extension (xlsx or xlsm) are automatically used. These file extensions are not recognized in the current CommunityFlu software programming. Therefore, when saving the software in the 2010 version, you **must** remember to change the file extension to ".xls" to ensure that the application will run smoothly under the new Excel version.

When running each intervention simulation run, you must re-run the baseline simulation each time by selecting "Run Baseline" command in Baseline: Data Input Page 11. Why should you do this? It is done because the raw data, graphs, and additional information results ( _as shown on the Results Menu page_ ) are not correctly updated when the baseline run simulations are not re-ran before selecting the "Run Intervention" command on the Intervention: Data Input Page 14.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. After running each interventions simulation, you must select the command "Refresh Intervention" on the Results Menu page before viewing any of the data results. This command allows the data that was recently calculated during the intervention simulation to be updated into the CommunityFlu model thus producing different results each time the 'Run Intervention" is selected. Without updating the intervention data, the results displayed will only represent the data that was derived from the previous intervention run.

###  Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that this is a test version of the software. The numbers
generated through the use of CommunityFlu 2.0 should not be considered
predictions of what **will** actually occur during a pandemic. Rather, they
should be treated as estimates of what **could** happen.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. First create a folder on your C: drive labeled "CommunityFlu"  
*Note: The label must be exact, as the program reads from and writes to this folder.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2.

Follow the extraction directions and place extracted files in the directory labeled C:CommunityFlu (Refer to Step 1 above).

After the user has downloaded the files to the correct C:CommunityFlu folder,
we also recommend creating a shortcut to the folder.
