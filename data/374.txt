## Summary

Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them.
Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating
foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also
have

  * Gas 
  * Diarrhea 
  * Swelling in your stomach 

Your doctor may do a blood, breath or stool test to find out if your problems
are due to lactose intolerance.

Lactose intolerance is not serious. Eating less food with lactose, or using
pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take
a calcium supplement if you don't get enough of it from your diet, since milk
and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most
people.
