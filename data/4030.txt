Rachelefsky GS, Lewis CE, de la Sota, A, Lewis MA. ACT (Asthma Care Training)
for Kids. A childhood asthma self-management program. Chest January
1985;(suppl to no.1):98S-100S.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Kaiser-Permanente facilities

**Target Population:**  
Children identified with severe asthma between the ages of 7 and 12 and their
parents

Severe asthma was defined as requiring medication at least 24% of the days of
a month. All participants were members of the Kaiser Permanente health care
system.

**Program Description:**  
An asthma education and self-management program designed to give children and
their parents the knowledge, confidence, and skills to reduce the frequency
and severity of asthma attacks.

The program was developed as a supplement to existing medical care. Children
and parents are taught to recognize symptoms, triggers and how to decide when
to use medication and when to get additional help. The five, 1-hour
educational sessions are held separately for parents and children; however,
they come together for the last 15 minutes of each session to practice what
they have learned. The program utilizes principles of social learning theory
to reinforce the message that children are in control of their asthma. To
convince children they have the ability to manage their asthma, a driving
analogy ("You are in the driver's seat") is used throughout the interactive
group educational sessions.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Children and their parents were randomly assigned to either the intervention
or the control group. The control group received 3-½ hours of lecture
presentations whereas the intervention group received 5 hours of interactive
activities in a smaller group setting. Data were collected via a structured
telephone interview at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after the study. Medical
records were also reviewed to ascertain if there were any changes in emergency
room visits and hospitalizations. ANOVA and non-parametric contingent analyses
were used to analyze the data.

**Sample Size:**  
76 children and their parents including 48 in the intervention group and 28 in
the control group.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included the number of emergency room visits and
hospitalizations, knowledge of asthma symptoms, triggers and treatments;
parental and child's perceptions of child's health status and ability to
control attacks; and steps taken during an attack. Although the intervention
and control groups had equivalent increases in knowledge and changes in
beliefs, the intervention groups increased their use of compliance behaviors
and reduced emergency room visits and days of hospitalizations. Qualitative
data indicated there were improvement in father/child relationships and less
smoking around children in the home.

The ACT for Kids Program kit is available by mail or phone, or it can be
ordered on line.

### Asthma Education Program for Pediatric Medicaid Patients

**Article Citation:**  
Kelly CS, Morrow AL, Shults J, Nakas N, Strope GL, Adelman RD. Outcome
evaluation of a comprehensive intervention program for asthmatic children
enrolled in Medicaid. Pediatrics 2000;105(5):1029-35.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The intervention took place at a pediatric allergy clinic in a Norfolk,
Virginia tertiary-care children's hospital.

**Target Population:**  
Low-income minority children enrolled in Medicaid who had two or more
emergency department (ED) visits or a hospitalization in the previous year
were targeted for the intervention.

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to evaluate the use of ED and hospitalization outcomes
for Medicaid-insured asthmatic children after the comprehensive asthma
intervention program. Children in the intervention group received asthma
education and medical treatment at the child's pediatric allergy clinic.
Education was tailored to the needs of each family by providing one-on-one
contact between child and family and a physician and asthma nurse. Education
included recognition of asthma triggers, environmental controls, symptoms and
warning signs, medication use and side effects, use of spacers and peak flow
meters, and management of exacerbations. Written action plans were provided.
An asthma outreach nurse maintained monthly contact with the intervention
group families to review the health status of the child, medicine
administration, to refill prescriptions, and to reinforce liaison between
patient and provider.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Children were alternately assigned in this controlled clinical trial,
resulting in similar intervention and control groups. Children were identified
for the study by computerized medical records. No incentive was offered for
participation. Skin testing was used where indoor allergen sensitivity was
apparent and avoidance techniques based on results were possible.
Immunotherapy was not started. ED and hospital records were used to assess
medical services use for the study year.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 80 children aged 2-16 years were included in the study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included ED visits and hospitalizations. The mean number of
ED visits at baseline and 1 year for the intervention group was 3.6 and 1.7
per child. Hospital visits decreased from 0.6 to 0.2 per child and hospital
days decreased from an average of 2.4 to 0.9 per child. In the control group,
ED visits decreased from 3.5 to 2.3 visits per child whereas hospitalizations
decreased from 0.53 to 0.48 and average hospital days decreased from 1.8 to
1.7 per child. Logistic regression analysis was used to control for individual
history of asthma outcomes in the prior year. Children in the control group
compared with those in the intervention group were 1.4 times more likely to
have an ED visit and 2.4 times more likely to be hospitalized, a statistically
significant difference.

**Availability of Protocol/Materials:**  
The protocol and materials are not available for widespread distribution.

**Case Study:** None

### Asthma Outreach Program (AOP)

**Article Citation:**  
Greineder, DK, Loane KC, Parks P. A randomized controlled pediatric asthma
outreach program. J Allergy Clin Immunol March 1999;103(pt 1):436-440.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The Health Centers Division of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a large HMO in New
England

**Target Population:**  
Children with asthma ages 1-15 and their families

**Program Description:**  
An asthma education program developed in accordance with the NHLBI Guidelines
for diagnosis and management for pediatric asthma. The program is a team-based
intervention using an allergy nurse, nurse practitioner, and allergist to help
patients gain knowledge about controlling their asthma. The program components
include a doctor's visit to assess a family's knowledge base, and education in
the following seven areas: 1) asthma definition/ pathogenesis, 2) triggers and
warning signs, 3) asthma medications, 4) inhaler, spacer, and nebulizer
training, 5) peak flow meter and zoning instruction, 6) environmental control
and adherence to medication schedules, and 7) importance of doctor visits. The
patient and family receive 1 one-on-one education session led by the AOP
nurse.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Patients continuously enrolled in a HMO for at least 2 consecutive years were
randomized into two groups. The control group received a single-intensive
asthma education intervention and the intervention group received the same
initial education but followed by asthma case management through the
intervention. The Wilcoxon matched pair signed rank and Chi-square tests were
used to analyze the data.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 57 patients participated, of whom 9 were recruited during
hospitalization and randomized into the "control group" and another 9 into the
intervention group. Thirty-nine other patients recruited by referral were
randomized independently into the control and intervention groups.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Data were collected on three key outcome variables: (1) ER visits, (2)
hospitalizations, and (3) health plan expenditures. Control patients had
significant reductions in ER visits (39%), hospitalizations (43%) and health
plan costs (28%), likely resulting from baseline educational intervention for
all enrolled patients. Intervention patients had significant reductions in ER
visits (73%), hospitalizations (84%) and health plan costs (82%). Compared to
the control group, intervention patients demonstrated additional reductions in
ER visits, hospitalizations, and outside of health plan use.

**Availability of Protocol/Materials:**  
The protocol and materials are not available for widespread distribution.

**Case Study:**  
None

Outcomes of an intervention programme for treatment of asthma in a primary
care clinic for Bedouins in Southern Israel. Family Practice 2002;19:448-51

**Intervention Setting:**  
A rural primary care clinic for Muslim Bedouins in southern Israel

**Target Population:**  
Bedouin children aged <14 years with asthma attending a health clinic.

**Program Description:**  
Many Bedouin children with asthma in southern Israel exhibited severe symptoms
even following medical treatment. A new Arabic clinical intervention was
developed that included numerous elements designed to optimize the treatment
of asthma at the clinic to improve children's health. The program included:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. in-service instruction to the clinic staff on new asthma guidelines;

**Evaluation Design:**  
A pre-post study design was utilized.

**Sample Size:**  
The study comprised 267 children (preintervention) and 276 children
(postintervention) who had been diagnosed with asthma.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included nebulizer treatments received by asthma patients in
the clinic, referrals to the emergency department, hospitalizations, and
availability of electric nebulizer equipment or space chambers in the homes of
children with asthma. Data on these parameters were collected over the course
of 3 months (November - January) before the intervention. These data were
again collected a year later (following the intervention) during the same
three-month period. Results included:

### Children's Hospital Asthma Management Program

**Article Citation(s):**  
Miller K, Ward-Smith P, Cox K, Jones EM, Portnoy JM. Development of an asthma
disease management program in a children's hospital. Current Allergy and
Asthma Reports 2003;3:491-500.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) in Kansas City, Kansas. CMH serves a large
metropolitan area and surrounding region. It is a regional Medicaid health
facility.

**Target Population:**  
Children who had an emergency visit or hospitalization for asthma

**Program Description:**  
In 1996, a small audit on the quality of CMH care for asthma patients revealed
that asthma care was deficient. The emergency department served as a primary
source for the children's asthma care. A more extensive audit showed that, in
1995, 2,738 children had emergency visits, and 472 were hospitalized for
asthma. These numbers represented about 6% of all emergency visits and
hospital admissions - a considerable impact on the hospital's health care
system. This discovery prompted development of a comprehensive asthma disease
management program at CMH with the goal of providing high-quality
interventions for children in whom asthma was diagnosed. Specific program aims
were to 1) reduce the frequency of admissions, 2) provide more cost-effective
care to patients who were admitted to the hospital, and 3) develop clinical
practice guidelines that encourage providers to use the best-known treatments
and thus improve the quality of care. The hospital developed a database to
merge clinical information from different hospital-based sources into a
central registry. The database was expanded to include encounter information
from a health plan mainframe, thereby creating a comprehensive registry of all
members with asthma in the health plan. This information, along with
prescription fill data, permitted the identification of all health plan
members who had asthma, regardless of whether they were seen at CMH, and to
fully track them through patterns of prescription use.

Stratification of patients by clinical severity and hospital use was carried
out to provide the most cost-effective asthma care and assign hospital
resources where they would produce the greatest benefit. Asthma severity also
was used to establish performance outcomes; e.g., providers prescribing
practices for patients with persistent asthma. Interventions included
education and use of clinical practice guidelines. An asthma educator was
hired to work in the primary care clinic 2 days a week to deliver standardized
asthma education, to foster awareness of proper asthma management and inspire
desirable changes in provider behavior. The hospital asthma educator taught
asthma self-management skills. Providers were encouraged to prepare asthma
action plans for the patients. Easy-to-read and color-coded Asthma Action
Cards were developed for use in teaching self-management.

The staff developed an Asthma Clinical Practice Guide (CPG) to standardize
management of asthma. An algorithm was developed that described an entire
hospital-based asthma encounter from presentation in the emergency setting
through an inpatient stay and, finally, to discharge planning. The CPG was
available to all hospital providers on an internal website linked to an
electronic order entry system to help minimize errors. Outcomes were imbedded
directly into the CPG so clinical outcomes and performance of providers could
be monitored.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Cohort study comparing outcomes between two groups of asthma patients treated
at the hospital: managed patients (Family Health Partners)(FHP) and unmanaged
Medicaid patients (non-FHP).

**Sample Size:**  
The sample size varied depending on the measure (emergency use or
hospitalization). The exact number is not clear.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included hospital admissions, costs, and quality of life
(QoL). Most hospital admissions for asthma occurred during the fall, with a
baseline admission rate throughout all seasons. During 1997 and 1998, asthma
admissions peaked in the fall both for the FHP group patients and the non-FHP
group patients. In 1999 and subsequent years, the peak was present only for
non-FHP patients. The main effect of the hospital intervention was that it
reduced peak use for FHP-insured patients. Costs per patient per admission for
inpatient asthma care in 1997-98 averaged $6,422.00 for FHP members and
$6,402.00 for non-FHP members. Per admission inpatient asthma care for FHP
members fell in 1998-1999 to an average of $4,266.00, while asthma care for
non-FHP members stayed nearly the same at $6,398.00 per admission. Data on QoL
were obtained from a randomly selected group of unmanaged and managed
patients. Data were collected at the initial visit, when the participants in
the managed group received asthma education and an asthma action plan, and at
the new two subsequent visits. The baseline QoL score for both patients and
caregivers in both groups was 4.5. In the managed population, caregiver QoL
scores rose to 5.2 by visit two (a 0.5 point change is considered clinically
significant). The patient's QoL remaining unchanged. By the subsequent visits,
the patients also reported an improved QoL. The QoL of unmanaged patients did
not improve. The CMH Asthma Disease Management Program led to fewer
hospitalizations, improved QoL for children and their caretakers, and a 37.5%
decrease in care costs.

environmental tobacco smoke exposure in asthmatic children. Chest Jan 1997;
111(1):81-88.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Pediatric medical clinic

**Target Population:**  
Children aged 6-17 years with asthma and at least one parent who smoked
cigarettes

**Program Description:**  
A behavioral medicine program designed to reduce asthmatic children's exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home.

The program consisted of (1) a six-month series of counseling sessions
designed to decrease ETS exposure attended by target parents and children, (2)
regular clinic visits, (3) two-week monitoring intervals preceding clinic
visits (with session diaries), and (4) standard medical care. Between
counseling sessions patients used diaries to record peak flow meter readings
and symptoms. Behavior modification techniques such as stimulus control,
shaping, and personal feedback were incorporated into programs tailored for
each families.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized clinical trial using a three-group repeated measures design.

The design assigned families to (1) an experimental group that received
counseling, monitored patients' exposure to smoke and monitored patients'
asthma symptoms, (2) a group that did not receive counseling but engaged in
the same monitoring activities, or (3) a control group that received the usual
care. Families were measured six times in twelve months. ANOVA was employed to
identify differences among groups.

**Sample Size:**  
91 families recruited from four large pediatric allergy clinics in San Diego.

Data were collected and final analyses conducted with 79 families.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Data were collected on children's exposure to ETS, and an environmental
monitor was used to validate parents' reported exposure and smoking rates.
Exposure to parents' cigarettes at home decreased for all groups. The
experimental group attained a 79% decrease in children's ETS exposure, the
monitoring group had a 42% decrease, and the control group had a 34% decrease.
ANOVA revealed a significant (p<.05) effect of the program over time. After 1
year, only the experimental group had a decrease in ETS exposure at home for
all smokers. The monitoring group increased exposure 14% and the usual
treatment group increased 22% over time.

community-based support program for families of children with chronic illness.
Pediatric outcomes. Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine
2002;156(6):533-9.

**Intervention Setting:**  
A community-based family support intervention and the referring sub-specialty
and general pediatric clinics and practices in the metropolitan Baltimore,
Maryland area.

**Target Population:**  
The study targeted mothers of children aged 7-11 years who had been diagnosed
as having diabetes, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, or asthma. Each child
had been treated at a clinic or a pediatrician's office. Eligible participants
lived within a 50-mile radius of Baltimore, their household had a telephone,
and the primary care giver was a woman and English-speaking. To be included in
the study as an asthma patient, the child had to have moderate to severe
disease, receive daily medication, and wheeze 2-3 times a week or had at least
one hospital or emergency department visit in the previous 6 months.

**Program Description:**  
Parents of children with chronic illnesses are at high risk for secondary
mental health problems (e.g., anxiety and depression). The objective of this
study was to evaluate potential changes in maternal mental health, anxiety,
and depression following participation in an intervention for families of
children with selected chronic illnesses, including asthma. Participants were
recruited through clinic directors or pediatricians. Network Mothers (mothers
of older children with similar conditions as the intervention mother's child)
were assigned one to seven of the intervention mothers. The Network Mothers
made bi-weekly phone contacts, seven face-to-face visits (usually at the
subject's home), and three special family events.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study design was a randomized controlled clinical trial with repeated
measures one year apart. A 45-90 minute interview was conducted at baseline
and at 12 months post-baseline. Interim interviews of 15-20 minutes were
conducted by phone at 4, 8, and 16 months post-baseline for each participant.
Mothers were compensated for their time and effort. Control children received
standard clinical care, and the mother received contact information for an
experienced parent whom they could call if they chose to do so.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Participants in the experimental group reported lower levels of anxiety post-
intervention compared with their baseline scores. By contrast, participants in
the control group reported higher levels of anxiety 1 year after baseline.
Analyses suggested that the intervention's effect was especially pronounced
for mothers who were highly anxious at baseline. The mean anxiety score for
experimental group mothers who reported that they were in good, fair, or poor
health at baseline decreased from 26.4 to 23.9 during the intervention period.
By contrast, the mean anxiety score for the control group mothers who reported
being in good, fair, or poor health at baseline increased from 24.8 at
baseline to 26.5 twelve months later. The intervention had no demonstrable
effect on symptoms of depression, perhaps because baseline levels were low.
However, after controlling for baseline anxiety, there was a substantial
decrease in anxiety among the experimental group. The study demonstrated that
a family support intervention can have positive effects on maternal anxiety.

Using a cut-off score that indicated a measure of adjustment and
maladjustment, 19% in the experimental group and 15% of the control group fell
below this cutoff point, i.e., were in the maladjustment category, at
baseline. At follow-up, 10% of the experimental group children and 21% of the
control group scored below this cut-off point. The study demonstrated that the
family-support intervention had modest, positive effects on the adjustment of
children with selected chronic illnesses. Investigators found no effect of the
intervention on measures of children's anxiety, depression, or self-esteem.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 161 families participated in the study. Of these, 73 in the
experimental group and 66 in the control group completed the trial.

The protocol and materials are not available for widespread distribution.

### Interactive Multimedia Program for Asthma Control and Tracking (IMPACT)

**Article Citation(s):**  
Krishna S, Francisco BD, Balas EA, Konig P, Graff GR, Madsen RW. Internet-
enabled interactive multimedia asthma education program: A randomized trial.
Pediatrics 2003;111:503-511.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Asthma clinic

**Target Population:**  
Children under 18 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of asthma at all
severity levels

**Program Description:**  
The program was designed to determine 1) whether the addition of an
interactive multimedia asthma education program would significantly increase
asthma knowledge of children and caregivers and 2) whether this increase in
asthma knowledge would be significantly related to disease outcomes and
healthcare resource use among the children with asthma when compared with a
control group. At enrollment, participants completed the Asthma Summary since
Last Visit, Pediatric Asthma Care Knowledge Survey, and Pediatric Asthma
Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire. Data were collected at two
subsequent visits scheduled about 3 months and 12 months after enrollment. The
intervention and control groups both received instruction from a nurse
practitioner using printed and verbal approaches to education. This
instruction followed the Caring for Kids with Asthma series, using 26
instructional sheets that focused on understanding asthma, selected devices,
medication and environmental factors. During the clinic visits, each child or
caregiver took part in one-on-one training to ensure correct use of devices
and medications. All families received an individualized, computer-generated
asthma action plan with detailed instructions for daily self-management and
guidelines for handling exacerbations and emergencies.

In addition to receiving conventional patient education, intervention group
children and families used the Interactive Multimedia Program for Asthma
Control and Tracking (IMPACT) during routine office visits. The IMPACT Kids CD
consists of vignettes covering basic pathophysiology of asthma, environmental
triggers, quick-relief and control medications, and strategies to control and
manage asthma. The program incorporates self-management principles in an
interactive format comprising animated lessons, each averaging a minute in
length. Ten of the lessons present real-life scenarios and require decisions
about alternative behaviors that would be likely to affect asthma. Other
lessons involve activities in which children learn to more accurately describe
their symptoms and medication use. IMPACT used the Internet and a Web-based
server to respond to individual learning needs (based on how participants
responded to questions posed in the lessons). The program was made available
to children and families only during clinic visits. The program tracked
educational progress of individual children and generated standardized reports
to help children, families, and schools record current symptom level and
medication use. The program was completed in about 1.3 hours, although actual
time varied by individual reading level and comprehension. The program was
used during waiting times within the flow of clinic activities between
recording patient vital signs, spirometry, physical exam, discussions of
therapeutic options and discharge teaching. It used participants' time
effectively while not incurring additional staffing overhead.

If the child was under 7 years of age, the parent used the program, and
his/her knowledge was assessed. Children aged 7-17 used the program while
their parents observed. At each tutorial session, IMPACT first presented
review lessons previously viewed from which incorrect answers were entered,
followed by new content. Users progressed in linear manner through the 44
lessons. IMPACT interspersed several types of lessons, including traditional
instructional vignettes, decision-making scenarios, and exercises to improve
the child's ability to report symptoms and medication use.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled study approach was used.

**Sample Size:**  
The study comprised 238 children with asthma visiting the Pediatric Pulmonary
and Allergy Clinic of the University of Missouri -- Columbia Health Care
referred by their primary care physicians for asthma.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included changes in asthma knowledge, use of quick rescue
relief medicine, asthma symptoms, lost school days and emergency visits.
Asthma knowledge improved significantly in the intervention subgroups:
caregivers of children aged 0-6 years, caregivers of children aged 7-17 years,
and children aged 7-17 years. At 12 months asthma symptom days decreased from
81 days to 51 days per year. The rate of school absences, decreased
significantly: 5.4 days per child per school year for the intervention
children compared with just a 1.6-day reduction for control children. The
number of emergency visits among the intervention group participants also
decreased significantly from 1.93 per year to 0.62. The intervention group
children used a significantly lower average daily dose of inhaled
corticosteroids following the third visit.

Hospitals in New York, NY

**Target Population:**  
Predominantly African American and Hispanic children, 4-17 years old,
diagnosed with asthma by a physician, and their caregivers

The children had at least one clinic visit and one wheezing episode in the
past year.

**Program Description:**  
A health education program based on the idea of family management of asthma.

This concept explicitly recognizes that pediatric self-management of asthma
often involves the participation and guidance of parents and other family
members. Based on previous interviews with asthmatic children, their parents
and physicians, the program was designed to give families a better
understanding of the medical aspects of asthma and what they can do as a unit
to help the child better manage his/her asthma. The program is grounded in
self-efficacy theory and Friere's idea that shared dialogue can lead to more
effective problem-solving skills among adults. The program, which was taught
in six weekly sessions, was also designed to be developmentally appropriate
for the children who participated. It was delivered in both Spanish and
English.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Children were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. All
sibling groups were kept together. Children and parents were interviewed prior
to the start of the study and one year following completion. From the
interview data, pre- and post-asthma management indices were constructed for
each child. Medical and school records were also reviewed. ANOVA and chi-
squared statistics were used to analyze the data.

**Sample Size:**  
600 participants

310 children with asthma and 290 parents were assigned to either the
intervention or control group. 207 children were in the intervention group,
and 103 were in the control group.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Data was collected to determine how well the program met its goals of teaching
families how to set realistic guidelines for children's activities; how to
prevent, monitor and treat attacks; how to administer medication; how to get
useful information from physicians; and how to improve the child's performance
is school. Parents in the experimental group improved significantly in their
ability to prevent and manage children's attacks as well as set more
reasonable limits on physical activity. Children demonstrated improvement in
their use of several asthma self-management techniques. It also appeared that
parents were more confident in their child's ability to manage his/her asthma.

asthma morbidity among inner-city children: Results of the National
Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study. Journal of Pediatrics 1999;135(3):
332-338.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Clinics

**Target Population:**  
Children diagnosed by physicians with moderate to severe asthma, 5- to
11-years old, English or Spanish-speaking, and living in selected inner-city
census tracts of one of eight metro areas served by the study

**Program Description:**  
A comprehensive community-based initiative designed to reduce asthma symptoms
and improving the quality of life for inner-city children

The initiative focused on asthma education, self-management techniques and
improving physician interaction with patients. The program utilized Asthma
Counselors (ACs) to educate and support families in their efforts to manage
the child's asthma. ACs were responsible for developing asthma management
plans based on oral instructions from physicians, helping families improve
their communication with physicians, encouraging caretakers to attend adult
group asthma education sessions, and referring families to community resources
for assistance with psychological/social issues and smoking cessation. The
initiative also provided families with pillow and mattress covers and
instructed families on way to minimize children's exposure to tobacco smoke
and pets.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized, multi-site, controlled trial

Participants completed a comprehensive baseline assessment on
hospitalizations, doctor visits, symptoms, home environment and medical care.
After the group sessions were completed, data were collected during bimonthly,
in-person caretaker interviews and telephone conversations during the
alternate months. Parents were asked to recall how well their child was doing
in the previous two weeks. Baseline and outcome data were compared using ANOVA
or the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests.

**Sample Size:**  
1033 children with asthma - 515 in the intervention group, and 518 in the
control group

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcomes included self-reported maximum number of symptom days,
hospitalizations, and unscheduled visits. For the first year, participants in
the intervention group reported fewer symptom days than did the control group.
The reduction among children with severe asthma was 3 times greater for the
intervention group. More control group children were hospitalized than
intervention group children. These results were similar in the second year of
the follow-up during which time they did not have access to the AC. The
results indicate that a community-based approach is an effective method for
inner city children and may be transportable to other settings.

_The Guide for Helping Children with Asthma_ , one of the primary intervention
materials, is available from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases by calling 301-496-7353. Other materials are not available at this

### Outpatient Clinic Asthma Management Program

Hui SHL, Jeung TF, Ha G, Wong E, Li AM, Fok TF. Evaluation of an asthma
management program for Chinese children with mild-to-moderate asthma in Hong
Kong. Pediatric Pulmonology 2002;33:22-9.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Outpatient clinic of a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong

**Target Population:**  
Children with mild to moderate asthma

**Program Description:**  
This intervention is based on the hypothesis that an asthma management program
conducted by a pediatric nurse specialist and focused on key symptoms could
improve outcome measures of asthma in children living in Hong Kong. The
intervention consisted of an interactive 2-hour group session with follow-up
visits at 3-month intervals with the nurse specialist. The asthma management
program addressed asthma symptoms and pathophysiology; trigger factors,
potential allergens, and importance of environmental control; principles and
techniques of using asthma medications; and use of an asthma diary. All
patients and their parents attended an interactive program session that
consisted of a video display summarizing the major issues related to asthma
pathogenesis and management. This session included a presentation on
appropriate contingency plans in case of acute asthma attacks. A final
30-minute group discussion allowed patients and parents to ask questions, and
the nurse specialist evaluated each patient's inhaler use technique.
Educational pamphlets that reinforced the program session were distributed to
each family, and patients were asked to keep an asthma diary on asthma
symptoms and the use of anti-asthma drugs. Children were then followed up in
the clinic at 3-month intervals during which patient knowledge and emergency
action plans for acute asthma attacks were reviewed and a check on drug
compliance was checked. The frequency of nocturnal cough and wheezing attacks,
as well as subjective evaluation of asthma severity, asthma-related quality of
life, and asthma knowledge scores were obtained from each patient at baseline
and 6 and 12 months after the educational session. Information also was
collected about the number and duration of hospitalizations, unscheduled
outpatient visits to any medical practitioners, unscheduled emergency
department visits, and number of school or daycare days missed for the year
before and after the asthma management program.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A prospective cohort study design

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 106 children aged 0-18 years with asthma who had no previous formal
education on contingency plans to help during acute asthma attacks

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Outcome measures included asthma symptoms, unscheduled outpatient attendance,
emergency department visits, school absenteeism, number and duration of
hospitalizations, and use of inhaled corticosteroids. Nocturnal cough,
wheezing attacks, and asthma severity decreased significantly while asthma-
related quality of life, and knowledge scores regarding asthma increased at 6
and 12 months after the asthma management program from those at baseline.
Additionally, acute asthma attacks, unscheduled outpatient visits, emergency
department visits, school absenteeism, total number of hospitalizations, and
duration of stay in hospitals because of asthma were significantly reduced
during the same period. Approximately 53% of patients used inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) at baseline, which increased to 74% over the study
period. This increased use of appropriate medication accounted for much of the
beneficial effect associated with the asthma management program. Nonetheless,
some additional improvement in asthma symptoms attributable to this program
could be detected after adjustment for steroid use.

At baseline 7% of families reported having taken avoidance measures against
house dust mites. Six months after the asthma management program, 92% of
families reported avoidance measures, and 12 months after the program, 93%
reported taking avoidance measures. This behavioral modification may have
resulted in reduced exposure of patients to this important aeroallergen and
probably contributed to improvement in asthma outcomes.

**Availability of Protocol and Materials:**  
The educational materials used in this study were based on an asthma course
from the New Zealand Asthma Foundation. The nurse specialist used an education
plan in conjunction with the asthma management program that is not copyrighted
and can be requested from the authors (see the published article referenced

A multisite randomized trial of the effects of physician education and
organizational change in chronic asthma care. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med
2004;158:875-83.

**Intervention Setting:**  
This study involved 42 primary care pediatric practices affiliated with four
managed care organizations. These included 15 practices in Seattle,
Washington; 11 Chicago, Illinois, area practices; and 16 practices in eastern
Massachusetts.

**Target Population:**  
Children aged 3-17 years with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma enrolled in
primary care practices affiliated with managed care organizations (MCO)

**Program Description:**  
Researchers incorporated--a "peer leader" physician education program and a
physician education program with a nurse-run intervention (to better organize
chronic asthma care in the primary care practice). They hypothesized that the
two interventions would reduce asthma symptom days as compared with usual
care.

Subjects for the study were identified from automated claims and pharmacy data
from MCOs for children with any asthma-related use in 1 year. That included
hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or ambulatory care treatment
that required two or more asthma medications during the same period.

The peer leader education intervention consisted of training one physician in
each practice site to serve as an asthma "champion" who would share asthma
care guidelines and other information with colleagues and encourage their use.
Peer leaders received training in asthma pharmacotherapy and physician
behavior change strategies. They also received ongoing support in their role
as change agents.

The interventions included two workshops, central support by an educational
coordinator, and an ongoing learning network for peer leaders via national and
local teleconferences. Each peer leader received a physician tool kit. The kit
included the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program/Expert Panel
Report 2 (NAEPP/EPR2) guidelines and laminated pocket cards summarizing the
EPR2 approach to diagnosis and treatment, among other resources. Each practice
also received a tool kit of patient education materials.

The educational coordinator contacted each peer leader every 1-2 months to
provide ideas, materials, and support; identify and resolve barriers to
change; and encourage less active peer leaders to become more involved. All
practices randomized to the second intervention, called Planned Asthma Care
(PAC), also received the peer leader education intervention. In addition, PAC
set up visits with a trained asthma nurse.

Asthma nurses were trained in EPR2 and in self-management support techniques.
Nurses attended a full day of training to learn motivational enhancement and
problem-solving techniques. They also met weekly or every other week for 10
weeks for 1-hour conference calls to review written materials with one of the
investigators. The asthma nurse scheduled four or five PAC visits during the 2
years of the study in conjunction with visits to the primary care physician.
At each visit the asthma nurse aimed to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. conduct a standardized assessment of asthma symptoms, medication use, environmental control, and self-management skills (and share a computer-generated report of findings with the child's physician),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. provide self-management support to families (regarding medication adherence, technical skills, and environmental triggers) using problem-solving and motivational techniques.

In between PAC visits, asthma nurses made standardized telephone follow-up
calls and worked with patients and parents who were reluctant to attend PAC
visits. Other asthma nurse activities included reviewing quarterly registry-
based asthma panel reports on medication use and emergency department visits
with physicians. They also arranged for allergists to visit the primary care
site for case discussions. The peer leader education coordinator documented
peer leader reports of asthma-related activities through telephone contacts
attempted every 1 to 2 months. Asthma nurses tracked PAC visits and telephone
calls and used a laptop database to record the data. Peer leaders performed an
average of 9.5 group sessions in their practices in 2 years. Planned care
intervention subjects had on average three PAC visits and 4.7 telephone
follow-up calls by the asthma nurse during the 2 years. PAC visits averaged 65
minutes (including the physician visit) and telephone sessions averaged 20
minutes.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This randomized controlled clinical trial compared two National Asthma
Education and Prevention Program guideline-based strategies to improve asthma
care for children in the primary care setting against usual care. Practices
were randomized within each geographic site to two intervention arms and usual
care.

**Sample Size:**  
638 children with an average age of 9.4 years. Of those, 60% were boys.
According to parent reports, the sample included 421 white subjects, 108
African American subjects, and 108 subjects of other races. [Ed Note: 421 +
108 + 108 = 637, but these are the numbers reported in the journal article]

**Outcome Measures:**  
Annualized asthma symptom days and frequency of brief oral steroid courses
(bursts)

**Results:**  
Researchers followed asthma symptom days across a 2-week period every 8 weeks.
This allowed them to assess 25% of the actual time on study and to measure the
effect of the intervention on long-term health status. Evaluation of oral
steroid bursts allowed researchers to detect exacerbations that might not
result in an emergency department visit or health care encounter.

**Details:**  
The pre-intervention mean (+/- standard deviation) annualized asthma symptom
days was 107.4 (+/- 122) days. Children in the planned care group had 13.3
fewer symptom days annually (-12% from baseline; P=0.02) than the usual care
children. Children in the peer leader group had 6.5 fewer symptom days per
year than the usual care children, a nonsignificant difference. The planned
care children had a 39% lower oral steroid burst rate per year relative to
usual care children. Children in the peer leader group had a 35% lower oral
steroid burst rate per year compared with children in the usual care group.

### Pediatric Asthma Episodes of Care Disease Management Program

**Article Citation:**  
Marosi A, Stiesmeyer J. Improving pediatric asthma patient outcomes by
incorporation of effective interventions. Journal of Asthma 2001;38(8):681-90.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Health clinic office

**Target Population:**  
Children who had uncontrolled asthma or those who did not adhere to prescribed
medication therapy

**Program Description:**  
This study tested the use of objective home pulmonary function monitoring in
conjunction with the use of long-term control medications and comprehensive
patient education to improve treatment adherence and asthma control and
decrease asthma severity. At the initial clinic appointment, a pediatric
allergist completed a comprehensive patient evaluation comprising an extensive
medical history, physical exam, allergy testing, pulmonary function studies,
radiographs (if indicated), and disease severity assessment. An asthma
management plan was then designed and explained to the patient and caregiver.
At the initial visit, the nurse specialist provided an individualized
educational plan and one-on-one instructions to each patient and family. Major
topics included introduction to asthma, trigger identification and control,
asthma medications, asthma equipment skills and asthma self-management. During
follow-up visits the nurse specialist evaluated the patient's asthma-related
knowledge and skills and provided additional information. Adherence to
prescribed therapy, response to medications, and symptom control also were
evaluated at follow-up visits. Adherence strategies were designed with
patients to promote regular use of long-term control medications and routine
monitoring of pulmonary function. Between clinic visits, the nurse specialist
contacted patients by phone to answer questions and resolve adherence
difficulties. Each patient was given an AirWatch monitor and taught how to use
it. The AirWatch electronic airway monitoring system (ENACT Health Management
Systems, Mountain View, California) comprises a hand-held, pager-sized
electronic device that measures peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Once a week, the patient connected the
AirWatch monitor to a phone line and sent lung function data to AirWatch
Central. AirWatch Central then faxed the patient status report, consisting of
graphs of the patient's PEF and FEV1 values for the previous 30 days and 6
months, to the allergist for evaluation. Patients received a monthly report
card summarizing pulmonary function values and compliance information for the
previous 30 days. During follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months, the allergist
assessed changes in the patient's health status and asthma severity.

**Evaluation Design:**  
An observational cohort design

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 80 children with uncontrolled asthma enrolled with the Lovelace
Health Systems in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Patients were enrolled in the study
if they chose to use the AirWatch computerized peak flow meter instead of the
conventional peak flow model.

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Outcome measures included adherence to medications, adherence to AirWatch,
asthma control, and asthma severity. Prestudy adherence to medication was 40%
of their combined prescribed medication therapy, and after 6 months of
intervention, the patients increased their combined adherence to 75% of their
total prescribed doses. Collective adherence to AirWatch decreased from 56% of
their prescribed readings at 1 month following initial visit to 40% at 3
months and to 23% at 6 months. The number of patients with optimal control
increased by more than threefold from 12 to 42 (15% to 52%), and patients with
only occasional symptoms almost doubled from 17 to 33 (21% to 41%). The number
of patients with frequent symptoms decreased from 32 to 3 (40% to 4%), and
patients with daily symptoms decreased from 19 to 2 (24% to 33%). Asthma
severity improvements also resulted from the intervention. At baseline, only
10 patients had mild persistent asthma; at follow-up this number rose to 21
patients. At baseline 70 patients presented with moderate and severe
persistent asthma. At follow-up this number had decreased to 58. Initially 59
had moderate persistent asthma; this number decreased to 50 following the
intervention, and the 11 diagnosed with severe persistent disease decreased to
eight at follow-up.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Physicians in the New York, New York, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, areas were
enrolled to receive two asthma seminars lasting 2-3 hours and spaced over a
2-3 week period.

**Target Population:**  
Children with asthma from low-income families (income < $20,000) who were
treated by physicians taking part in the study. (Note: The objective of this
arm of the larger study was to determine if low-income child patients of
physicians who participated in the intervention also benefited in health
outcomes.)

**Program Description:**  
The study hypothesis was that physicians participating in the seminars
regarding asthma care would improve their patient health outcomes. Primary
care pediatricians were randomized to the interactive seminars or to a control
group. A random sample of patients (children) from each of the participating
physicians was selected to assess the effectiveness of the program. Children
qualified for the study if they had an asthma diagnosis by a physician, had no
other chronic conditions, and had received emergency care at least once for
asthma in the prior year. Children in the study had frequent asthma symptoms.
Parents reported that 96.1% of all children had persistent symptoms and that
88.2% had moderate-to-severe persistent asthma during at least one season of
the year.

The interactive seminar was based on a previously reported theory of physician
self-regulation to enhance their therapeutic skills in treating childhood
asthma and to develop their ability to educate and counsel families about
asthma self-management. The two main components of the program included
optimal clinical practice following National Asthma Education and prevention
(NAEPP) guidelines and patient teaching and communication. The program
included several activities and materials:

The first visit that the patient made to the physician within 22 months after
the intervention was followed by an interview with the parent. The parent
interview consisted of questions related to the children's asthma symptoms,
prescribed medications, use of health care services, and parental observations
regarding physicians' teaching and communication behaviors. The patient then
was tracked and evaluated at 12 months and 24 months after the initial visit.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Randomized controlled trial

**Sample Size:**  
The sample included 23 pediatricians and 36 of their patients: children with
asthma from low-income families, ages 1-12 years. This study is a subset of a
larger study involving 74 pediatricians and 637 of their patients.

**Outcome Measures:**  
Health care use for asthma: presenting at emergency departments and admission
to the hospital

**Results:**  
Low-income children in the treatment group were significantly less likely to
be admitted to an emergency department (annual rate, 0.208 vs. 1.44,
respectively) or to the hospital (annual rate, 0 vs. 0.029, respectively) for
asthma care compared to low-income children in the control group during the
2-year assessment period. Low-income children in the treatment group tended to
have higher levels of use of controller medications, to receive a written
asthma action plan, and to miss fewer days of school. These differences were
not statistically significant compared to low-income children in the control
group. This study shows that the effectiveness of the physicians' education
program is not reserved merely to those patients with more resources. The
greatest decline in emergency department use was in children from low-income
families, when compared with children of middle- and upper-income families in
the larger study.

### Tobacco Smoke Reduction Program

**Article Citation:**  
Wilson SR, Yamada EG, Sudhakar R, Roberto L, Mannino D, Mejia C, Huss N. A
controlled trial of an environmental tobacco smoke reduction intervention in
low-income children with asthma. Chest 2001;20:1709-22.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The pediatric pulmonary service of a regional pediatric hospital in central
California

**Target Population:**  
Low-income minority children with asthma exposed to environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) who were Medicaid/Medi-Cal-eligible and were at risk of having
been seen for acute asthma in an urgent-care setting, hospital emergency
department, or impatient hospital setting in the previous year

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to determine the effectiveness of a cotinine-feedback,
behaviorally-based education intervention in reducing ETS exposure and health-
care utilization of children with asthma. The intervention consisted of three
one-on-one, behaviorally-based counseling sessions provided by a nurse-
educator spaced over 5 weeks. The protocol included instruction about asthma
and its treatment, environmental controls, the inflammatory nature of asthma,
and the role of ETS in exacerbating and sustaining inflammation. Behavior-
changing strategies were used to gain cooperation. ETS exposure recall was
reported at each session for the 3 days preceding the session. A key feature
of the intervention was repeated feedback to parents over a 5-week period
regarding the results of four successive urine cotinine measures to inform
them of the level of exposure to the child and the success of their efforts to
reduce this exposure.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study was a randomized controlled trial of an educational intervention
compared with usual care. Assays for urine cotinine and creatinine were
completed for intervention and control children at enrollment and at 6 and 12
months after enrollment. Intervention children provided urine samples at each
intervention session. All children's asthma drugs were adjusted as needed
following enrollment. Medical records were reviewed at the end of the follow-
up year.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 87 children aged 3-12 years, 44 in the intervention group and 43 in
the control group, participated in the study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
The primary outcome measures investigated were emergency and urgent health
utilization for asthma and ETS exposure as indexed by the child's urine
cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR). The proportion of children with more than one
asthma-related medical visit decreased substantially in the intervention group
from 50% in baseline year to 29.6% in follow-up year, contrasted by a
substantial increase of 37.2 % to 46.5% in the control group. The odds of
having more than one medical visit were reduced by about two thirds in the
intervention group compared with the control group. Cotinine-level differences
correspond to a 46% greater reduction in the CCR in the intervention group
than in the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant.
A trend toward relatively low odds of hospitalization in the intervention
group was observed, but the differences were not statistically significant.

**Availability of Protocol/Materials:**  
The protocol and materials are not available for widespread distribution.

**Case Study:**  
None

parents of infants and very young children with asthma: a developmental
evaluation of the Wee Wheezer's program. J Asthma 1996;33(4):239-254.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Outpatient clinic

**Target Population:**  
Children with asthma and less than seven years of age and their families

**Program Description:**  
An asthma education program in English and Spanish, based on social learning
theory, designed specifically for parents of young children under the age of
seven

The program helps parents gain the knowledge, skills and motivation necessary
to recognize, prevent, and/or appropriately manage asthma symptoms; to use
medical, educational, and interpersonal resources for information and support;
communicate effectively with other adult caretakers and physicians; and
promote general well-being of the family unit. The program consists of four
small group sessions that last approximately 2 hours each. Nurses familiar
with asthma management facilitate the sessions.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Unavailable

**Sample Size:**  
76 families, 41 in the intervention and 35 controls

The control families received the program after the intervention was
completed.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included symptom-free asthma days as reported by parents,
parental sleep interruption, degree to which child was bothered by asthma
symptoms, and the number of days the child was sick due to asthma. ANOVA was
used to analyze the data. Children in the treatment group experienced
improvement on all five outcomes and statistically significant improvement in
two outcomes: symptom-free days and sleep interruption. There were also
significant gains in parental knowledge about asthma and asthma management.
