## Summary

Your family history includes health information about you and your close
relatives. Families have many factors in common, including their genes,
environment, and lifestyle. Looking at these factors can help you figure out
whether you have a higher risk for certain health problems, such as heart
disease, stroke, and cancer.

Having a family member with a disease raises your risk, but it does not mean
that you will definitely get it. Knowing that you are at risk gives you a
chance to reduce that risk by following a healthier lifestyle and getting
tested as needed.

You can get started by talking to your relatives about their health. Draw a
family tree and add the health information. Having copies of medical records
and death certificates is also helpful.
