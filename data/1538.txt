### What is Down Syndrome?

Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome.
Chromosomes are small "packages" of genes in the body. They determine how a
baby's body forms during pregnancy and how the baby's body functions as it
grows in the womb and after birth. Typically, a baby is born with 46
chromosomes. Babies with Down syndrome have an extra copy of one of these
chromosomes, chromosome 21. A medical term for having an extra copy of a
chromosome is 'trisomy.' Down syndrome is also referred to as Trisomy 21. This
extra copy changes how the baby's body and brain develop, which can cause both
mental and physical challenges for the baby.

Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person
has different abilities. People with Down syndrome usually have an IQ (a
measure of intelligence) in the mildly-to-moderately low range and are slower
to speak than other children.

Some common physical features of Down syndrome include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * A flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose

### How Many Babies are Born with Down Syndrome?

Down syndrome remains the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the
United States. Each year, about 6,000 babies born in the United States have
Down syndrome. This means that Down syndrome occurs in about 1 in every 700
babies.1

### Types of Down Syndrome

There are three types of Down syndrome. People often can't tell the difference
between each type without looking at the chromosomes because the physical
features and behaviors are similar.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Trisomy 21:** About 95% of people with Down syndrome have Trisomy 21.2 With this type of Down syndrome, each cell in the body has 3 separate copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual 2 copies.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Translocation Down syndrome:** This type accounts for a small percentage of people with Down syndrome (about 3%).2 This occurs when an extra part or a whole extra chromosome 21 is present, but it is attached or "trans-located" to a different chromosome rather than being a separate chromosome 21.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Mosaic Down syndrome:** This type affects about 2% of the people with Down syndrome.2 Mosaic means mixture or combination. For children with mosaic Down syndrome, some of their cells have 3 copies of chromosome 21, but other cells have the typical two copies of chromosome 21. Children with mosaic Down syndrome may have the same features as other children with Down syndrome. However, they may have fewer features of the condition due to the presence of some (or many) cells with a typical number of chromosomes.

### Causes and Risk Factors

Researchers know that Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome, but no one knows for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role.

Women who are 35 years or older when they become pregnant are more likely to have a pregnancy affected by Down syndrome than women who become pregnant at a younger age.3-5However, the majority of babies with Down syndrome are born to mothers less than 35 years old, because there are many more births among younger women.6,7

### Diagnosis

There are two basic types of tests available to detect Down syndrome during
pregnancy: screening tests and diagnostic tests. A screening test can tell a
woman and her healthcare provider whether her pregnancy has a lower or higher
chance of having Down syndrome. Screening tests do not provide an absolute
diagnosis, but they are safer for the mother and the developing baby.
Diagnostic tests can typically detect whether or not a baby will have Down
syndrome, but they can be more risky for the mother and developing baby.
Neither screening nor diagnostic tests can predict the full impact of Down
syndrome on a baby; no one can predict this.

### Screening Tests

Screening tests often include a combination of a blood test, which measures
the amount of various substances in the mother's blood (e.g., MS-AFP, Triple
Screen, Quad-screen), and an ultrasound, which creates a picture of the baby.
During an ultrasound, one of the things the technician looks at is the fluid
behind the baby's neck. Extra fluid in this region could indicate a genetic
problem. These screening tests can help determine the baby's risk of Down
syndrome. Rarely, screening tests can give an abnormal result even when there
is nothing wrong with the baby. Sometimes, the test results are normal and yet
they miss a problem that does exist.

### Diagnostic Tests

Diagnostic tests are usually performed after a positive screening test in
order to confirm a Down syndrome diagnosis. Types of diagnostic tests include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)--examines material from the placenta
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Amniocentesis--examines the amniotic fluid (the fluid from the sac surrounding the baby)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS)--examines blood from the umbilical cord

These tests look for changes in the chromosomes that would indicate a Down
syndrome diagnosis.

### Other Health Problems

Many people with Down syndrome have the common facial features and no other
major birth defects. However, some people with Down syndrome might have one or
more major birth defects or other medical problems. Some of the more common
health problems among children with Down syndrome are listed below.8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Hearing loss

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Ear infections
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Eye diseases
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Heart defects present at birth

Health care providers routinely monitor children with Down syndrome for these
conditions.

### Treatments

Down syndrome is a lifelong condition. Services early in life will often help
babies and children with Down syndrome to improve their physical and
intellectual abilities. Most of these services focus on helping children with
Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services include speech,
occupational, and physical therapy, and they are typically offered through
early intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may
also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are
included in regular classes.
