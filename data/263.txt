## Summary

Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas
through the mouth is called belching or burping. Passing gas through the anus
is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor
comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases
that contain sulfur.

Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and
the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine. Certain
foods may cause gas. Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in
another.

You can reduce the amount of gas you have by

  * Drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks
  * Eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat
  * Avoiding milk products if you have lactose intolerance

Medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your
symptoms still bother you, see your health care provider.
