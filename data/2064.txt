#  DASH Eating Plan

Also called: DASH Diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension

## Summary

DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It is an eating plan
that is based on research studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI). These studies showed that DASH lowers high blood
pressure and improves levels of cholesterol. This reduces your risk of getting
heart disease.

The DASH eating plan

    * Emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole-grains
    * Includes fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils
    * Limits foods that are high in saturated fat. These foods include fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils.
    * Limits sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets

Along with DASH, other lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure.
They include staying at a healthy weight, exercising, and not smoking.
