The Board of Scientific Counselors, National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) was established under Section 222 of the Public Health
Service Act (42 U.S.C. Section 217a), as amended. The board is governed by the

related to developing and evaluating hypotheses, systematically documenting
findings, and disseminating results. The board shall evaluate the degree to
which the activities of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health: (1) conform to those standards of scientific excellence appropriate
for Federal scientific institutions in accomplishing objectives in
occupational safety and health; (2) address currently relevant needs in the
fields of occupational safety and health either alone or in conjunction with
other known activities inside and outside of the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health; and (3) produce their intended results in
addressing important research questions in occupational safety and health,
both in terms of applicability of the research findings and dissemination of
the findings.
