## Summary

Testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped
organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. It's easy
to injure your testicles because they are not protected by bones or muscles.
Men and boys should wear athletic supporters when they play sports.

You should examine your testicles monthly and seek medical attention for
lumps, redness, pain or other changes. Testicles can get inflamed or infected.
They can also develop cancer. Testicular cancer is rare and highly treatable.
It usually happens between the ages of 15 and 40.
