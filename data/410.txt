## Summary

Our environment affects our health. If parts of the environment, like the air,
water, or soil become polluted, it can lead to health problems. For example,
asthma pollutants and chemicals in the air or in the home can trigger asthma
attacks.

Some environmental risks are a part of the natural world, like radon in the
soil. Others are the result of human activities, like lead poisoning from
paint, or exposure to asbestos or mercury from mining or industrial use.
