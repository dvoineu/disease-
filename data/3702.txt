When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms usually
do not appear for up to two months (2-6 weeks) after being infested; however,
an infested person still can spread scabies during this time even though
he/she does not have symptoms.

If a person has had scabies before, symptoms appear much sooner (1-4 days)
after exposure. An infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not
have symptoms, until they are successfully treated and the mites and eggs are
destroyed.

#### Common Symptoms

The most common symptoms of scabies, itching and a skin rash, are caused by
sensitization (a type of "allergic" reaction) to the proteins and feces of the
parasite. Severe itching (pruritus), especially at night, is the earliest and
most common symptom of scabies. A pimple-like (papular) itchy (pruritic)
"scabies rash" is also common. Itching and rash may affect much of the body or
be limited to common sites such as:

The head, face, neck, palms, and soles often are involved in infants and very
young children, but usually not adults and older children.

Tiny burrows sometimes are seen on the skin; these are caused by the female
scabies mite tunneling just beneath the surface of the skin. These burrows
appear as tiny raised and crooked (serpiginous) grayish-white or skin-colored
lines on the skin surface. Because mites are often few in number (only 10-15
mites per person), these burrows may be difficult to find. They are found most
often in the webbing between the fingers, in the skin folds on the wrist,
elbow, or knee, and on the penis, breast, or shoulder blades.

#### Possible Complications

The intense itching of scabies leads to scratching that can lead to skin
sores. The sores sometimes become infected with bacteria on the skin, such as
_Staphylococcus aureus_ or beta-hemolytic streptococci. Sometimes the
bacterial skin infection can lead an inflammation of the kidneys called post-
streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

#### Crusted (Norwegian) scabies

Crusted scabies is a severe form of scabies that can affect the elderly,
persons who are immunocompromised, or persons who have conditions that prevent
them from itching and/or scratching (spinal cord injury, paralysis, loss of
sensation, mental debility). Crusted scabies is characterized by vesicles and
thick crusts over the skin that can contain many mites. Itching (pruritus) may
be absent in crusted scabies because of a patient's altered immune status or
neurological condition. Because they are infested with large numbers of mites
(up to 2 million), persons with crusted scabies are very contagious. Persons
with crusted scabies may not show the usual signs and symptoms of scabies such
as the characteristic rash or itching (pruritus).
