LDL: The "Bad" Cholesterol

#  LDL: The "Bad" Cholesterol

Also called: Low-density lipoprotein

## Summary

### What is cholesterol?

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in
your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as
meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.
But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary
artery disease.

### What are LDL and HDL?

LDL and HDL are two types of lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat
(lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they
can move through the blood. LDL and HDL have different purposes:

    * LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the "bad" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.
    * HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the "good" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.

### How can a high LDL level raise my risk of coronary artery disease and
other diseases?

If you have a high LDL level, this means that you have too much LDL
cholesterol in your blood. This extra LDL, along with other substances, forms
plaque. The plaque builds up in your arteries; this is a condition called
atherosclerosis.

Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of
your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed, which
slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart. Since your blood carries
oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough
oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain), or if the blood flow is completely
blocked, a heart attack.

### How do I know what my LDL level is?

A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including LDL. When and how
often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family
history. The general recommendations are:

**For people who are age 19 or younger:**

    * The first test should be between ages 9 to 11
    * Children should have the test again every 5 years
    * Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke

**For people who are age 20 or older:**

    * Younger adults should have the test every 5 years
    * Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years

### What can affect my LDL level?

Things that can affect your LDL level include

    * **Diet.** Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise
    * **Weight.** Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level
    * **Physical Activity.** A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain, which can raise your LDL level
    * **Smoking.** Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL from your arteries, if you have less HDL, that can contribute to you having a higher LDL level.
    * **Age and Gender.** As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL levels tend to rise.
    * **Genetics.** Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high blood cholesterol.
    * **Medicines.** Certain medicines, including steroids, some blood pressure medicines, and HIV/AIDS medicines, can raise your LDL level.
    * **Other medical conditions.** Diseases such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS can cause a higher LDL level.
    * **Race.** Certain races may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites.

### What should my LDL level be?

With LDL cholesterol, lower numbers are better, because a high LDL level can
raise your risk for coronary artery disease and related problems:

LDL (Bad) Cholesterol Level | LDL Cholesterol Category  
---|---  
Less than 100mg/dL | Optimal  
100-129mg/dL | Near optimal/above optimal  
130-159 mg/dL | Borderline high  
160-189 mg/dL | High  
190 mg/dL and above | Very High  
  

### How can I lower my LDL level?

There are two main ways to lower your LDL cholesterol:

    * **Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC).** TLC includes three parts:
      * **Heart-healthy eating.** A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan.
      * **Weight Management.** If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL cholesterol.
      * **Physical Activity.** Everyone should get regular physical activity (30 minutes on most, if not all, days).
    * **Drug Treatment.** If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins. The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your health care provider about which one is right for you. While you are taking medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.

Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment
called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to
remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of
the blood back to the person.
