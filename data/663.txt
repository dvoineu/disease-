## Summary

Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and deep underlying tissues. Group A
strep (streptococcal) bacteria are the most common cause. The bacteria enter
your body when you get an injury such as a bruise, burn, surgical cut, or
wound.

Symptoms include

    * Fever and chills
    * Swollen glands or lymph nodes
    * A rash with painful, red, tender skin. The skin may blister and scab over.

Your health care provider may take a sample or culture from your skin or do a
blood test to identify the bacteria causing infection. Treatment is with
antibiotics. They may be oral in mild cases, or intravenous (by IV) for more
severe cases.
