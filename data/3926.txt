## Overview

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious syndrome (a pattern of
symptoms) that causes limb weakness, mostly in children. Three national
outbreaks have occurred starting in 2014, when CDC began surveillance for AFM.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Most patients developed AFM in late summer or early fall.

### Clinicians: Timing is Key for AFM

![Clinicians: Timing is Key for AFM. Recognize AFM early: Be alert for onset
of acute flaccid limb weakness and consider AFM on your differential
diagnosis. Collect specimens & then get MRI: Collect cerebrospinal fluid
\(CSF\), serum, stool, and nasopharyngeal \(NP\) swab as soon as possible, and
handle and store specimens properly. Rapidly report to health department: If
the MRI shows a spinal lesion with some gray matter involvement, alert the
health department and send specimens and medical records.Diagnosis & medical
management: Refer to specialists, monitor for signs of worsening symptoms,
hospitalize if indicated, and begin treatment and
rehabilitation.](/vitalsigns/afm/images/afm-vital-signs-infographic1.jpg)
