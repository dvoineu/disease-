## Summary

When you play the piano or hit a tennis ball you are activating the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that controls coordination
and balance. Problems with the cerebellum include

    * Cancer
    * Genetic disorders
    * Ataxias - failure of muscle control in the arms and legs that result in movement disorders
    * Degeneration - disorders caused by brain cells decreasing in size or wasting away

Treatment of cerebellar disorders depends on the cause. In some cases, there
is no cure but treatment may help with symptoms.
