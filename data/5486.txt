Tuberculous meningitis is an infection of the tissues covering the brain and
spinal cord (meninges).

## Causes

Tuberculous meningitis is caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. This is the
bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). The bacteria spread to the brain and
spine from another place in the body, usually the lung.

Tuberculous meningitis is very rare in the United States. Most cases are
people who traveled to the United States from other countries where TB is
common.

People who have the following have a higher chance of developing tuberculous
meningitis:

    * HIV/AIDS
    * Drink alcohol in excess
    * TB of the lung
    * Weakened immune system 

## Symptoms

The symptoms often start slowly, and may include:

    * Fever and chills
    * Mental status changes
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
    * Severe headache
    * Stiff neck (meningismus)

Other symptoms that can occur with this disease may include:

    * Agitation
    * Bulging fontanellesÂ (soft spots) in babies
    * Decreased consciousness
    * Poor feeding or irritability in children
    * Unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwardÂ (opisthotonos).Â This is usually found in infants.Â 

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you. This will usually show that you
have the following:

    * Fast heart rate
    * Fever
    * Mental status changes
    * Stiff neck 

A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is an important test in diagnosing meningitis.
It is done to collect a sample of spinal fluid for examination. More than one
sample may be needed to make the diagnosis.

Other tests that may be done include:

    * Biopsy of the brain or meninges (rare)
    * Blood culture
    * Chest x-ray
    * CSF examination for cell count, glucose, and protein
    * CT scan of the head
    * Gram stain, other special stains, and culture of CSF
    * Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF
    * Skin test for TB (PPD)
    * Other tests to look for TB 

## Treatment

You will be given several medicines to fight the TB bacteria. Sometimes,
treatment is started even if your provider thinks you have the disease, but
testing has not confirmed it yet.

Treatment usually lasts for at least 12 months. Medicines called
corticosteroids may also be used.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Tuberculous meningitis is life threatening if untreated. Long-term follow-up
is needed to detect repeated infections (recurrences).

## Possible Complications

Untreated, the disease can cause any of the following:

    * Brain damage
    * Build-up of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)
    * Hearing loss
    * HydrocephalusÂ (buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling)
    * Seizures
    * Death

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or go to an emergency room if
you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:

    * Feeding problems
    * High-pitched cry
    * Irritability
    * Persistent unexplained fever 

Call the local emergency number if you develop any of the serious symptoms
listed above. Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.

## Prevention

Treating people who have signs of a non-active (dormant) TB infection can
prevent its spread. A PPD test and other TB tests can be done to tell if you
have this type of infection.

Some countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccine called BCG to
prevent TB. But, the effectiveness of this vaccine is limited, and it is not
usually used in the United States. The BCG vaccine may help prevent severe
forms of TB, such as meningitis, in very young children who live in areas
where the disease is common.

## Alternative Names

Tubercular meningitis; TB meningitis
