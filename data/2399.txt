Related Pages

The NIOSH extramural research and training programs include diverse portfolios
of investigator initiated research, mentored research scientist career
development awards, training programs, and small business innovation research
projects. Multidisciplinary education and research centers, state surveillance
programs, and global occupational health initiatives complement the breadth
and depth of extramural research and training at NIOSH.

A description of these portfolios is available along with links to current
performance data. Extramural performance data includes a listing of all active
awards, extramural funding summary by activity and year, and research funding
success rates. A link to the NIH Research Reporting Online Reporting Tools
(RePORT) provides access to reports, data and analysis of all NIH research.
NIOSH participates in this program and you can search NIOSH funded reports by
selecting CDC-NIOSH in the Agency /Institute/Center field on the query page.

The peer review and program management of the NIOSH extramural research and
training program portfolios is managed by the scientific program officials in
the Office of Extramural Programs (OEP). The OEP also manages the extramural
portfolio of cooperative agreements for the World Trade Center Health Program
(WTCHP). This portfolio includes the WTCHP Registry, research projects, and
outreach activities. Please see funding opportunities for current grant
opportunities at NIOSH.
