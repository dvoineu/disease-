## Summary

The prostate is a gland in men. It helps make semen, the fluid that contains
sperm. The prostate surrounds the tube that carries urine out of the body. As
men age, their prostate grows bigger. If it gets too large, it can cause
problems. An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). Most men will get BPH as they get older. Symptoms often start after age
50.

BPH is not cancer, and it does not seem to increase your chance of getting
prostate cancer. But the early symptoms are the same. Check with your doctor
if you have

  * A frequent and urgent need to urinate, especially at night
  * Trouble starting a urine stream or making more than a dribble
  * A urine stream that is weak, slow, or stops and starts several times
  * The feeling that you still have to go, even just after urinating
  * Small amounts of blood in your urine

Severe BPH can cause serious problems over time, such as urinary tract
infections, and bladder or kidney damage. If it is found early, you are less
likely to develop these problems.

Tests for BPH include a digital rectal exam, blood and imaging tests, a urine
flow study, and examination with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatments
include watchful waiting, medicines, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery.
