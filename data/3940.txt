## Overview

We can end the HIV epidemic in the US. Immediate, effective treatment is key.
Taking HIV medicine as prescribed can make the amount of virus in the body
very low (called viral suppression* or undetectable). People with HIV who stay
undetectable can stay healthy and have effectively no risk of sexually
transmitting HIV.

**To reduce new infections:**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Early HIV diagnosis is crucial. Everyone aged 13-64 should be tested at least once. People at high risk should be tested at least annually. Sexually active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (e.g., every 3-6 months). bit.ly/2eJ8YNz

People who stay in lifetime treatment can live longer, prevent complications from HIV, and prevent transmission through sex.

* Less than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood

Problem

##### Many people with HIV aren't getting the treatment they need.

###### About half of people with HIV are virally suppressed or undetectable.
