## Summary

A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of
pregnancy. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy, often before
a woman even knows she is pregnant.

Factors that may contribute to miscarriage include

    * A genetic problem with the fetus
    * Problems with the uterus or cervix
    * Chronic diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome

Signs of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting, abdominal pain or cramping,
and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of
miscarriage, but many women also have it in early pregnancy and don't
miscarry. To be sure, contact your health care provider right away if you have
bleeding.

Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not need any treatment.
In some cases, there is tissue left in the uterus. Doctors use a procedure
called a dilatation and curettage (D&C) or medicines to remove the tissue.

Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you do decide to try
again, work closely with your health care provider to lower the risks. Many
women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy babies.
