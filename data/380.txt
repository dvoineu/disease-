## Summary

Amyloidosis occurs when abnormal proteins called amyloids build up and form
deposits. The deposits can collect in organs such as the kidney and heart.
This can cause the organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they
should.

There are three main types of amyloidosis:

  * Primary - with no known cause
  * Secondary - caused by another disease, including some types of cancer
  * Familial - passed down through genes

Symptoms can vary, depending upon which organs are affected. Treatment depends
on the type of amyloidosis you have. The goal is to help with symptoms and
limit the production of proteins. If another disease is the cause, it needs to
be treated.
