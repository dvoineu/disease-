New: **_Recommendations for Providing Quality STD Clinical Services (STD
QCS)_** , a companion piece to _STD Treatment Guidelines 2015_.

### Summary

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were updated by CDC after consultation
with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in
Atlanta on April 30-May 2, 2013. The information in this report updates the
Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010 ( _MMWR_ Recomm Rep
2010;59 [No. RR-12]). These updated guidelines discuss 1) alternative
treatment regimens for _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ ; 2) the use of nucleic acid
amplification tests for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis; 3) alternative
treatment options for genital warts; 4) the role of _Mycoplasma genitalium_ in
urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; 5) updated HPV
vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) the management of persons
who are transgender; 7) annual testing for hepatitis C in persons with HIV
infection; 8) updated recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of urethritis;
and 9) retesting to detect repeat infection. Physicians and other health-care
providers can use these guidelines to assist in the prevention and treatment
of STDs.
