## Summary

Even if you use them properly, many chemicals can still harm human health and
the environment. When you throw these substances away, they become hazardous
waste. Some hazardous wastes come from products in our homes. Our garbage can
include such hazardous wastes as old batteries, bug spray cans and paint
thinner. U.S. residents generate 1.6 million tons of household hazardous waste
per year. Hazardous waste is also a by-product of manufacturing.

You may have hazardous wastes in your basement or garage. How do you get rid
of them? Don't pour them down the drain, flush them, or put them in the
garbage. See if you can donate or recycle. Many communities have household
hazardous waste collection programs. Check to see if there is one in your
area.
