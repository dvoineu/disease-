## Summary

Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on your skin. An allergic reaction to
a drug or food usually causes them. Allergic reactions cause your body to
release chemicals that can make your skin swell up in hives. People who have
other allergies are more likely to get hives than other people. Other causes
include infections and stress.

Hives are very common. They usually go away on their own, but if you have a
serious case, you might need medicine or a shot. In rare cases, hives can
cause a dangerous swelling in your airways, making it hard to breathe - which
is a medical emergency.
