#  Coping with Disasters

## Summary

No matter how well you have prepared, you might feel dazed or numb after going
through a disaster. You may also feel sad, helpless, or anxious. In spite of
the tragedy, you might just feel happy to be alive.

It is not unusual to have bad memories or dreams. You may avoid places or
people that remind you of the disaster. You might have trouble sleeping,
eating, or paying attention. Many people have short tempers and get angry
easily. These are all normal reactions to stress.

Sometimes the stress can be too much to handle alone. Some people have long-
term problems after a disaster, including

  * Post-traumatic stress disorder
  * Depression
  * Self-blame
  * Suicidal thoughts
  * Alcohol or drug misuse

If your emotional reactions are getting in the way of your relationships,
work, or other important activities, talk to a counselor or your health care
provider. Treatments are available.
