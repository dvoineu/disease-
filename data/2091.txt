## Summary

Heroin is a white or brown powder or a black, sticky goo. It's an opioid drug
made from morphine, a natural substance in the seedpod of the Asian poppy
plant. It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also
be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it
to the brain very quickly. This makes it very addictive.

Major health problems from heroin include miscarriages, heart infections, and
death from overdose. People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious
diseases, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.

Regular use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and
more drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes
dependent on heroin. If dependent users stop heroin, they have withdrawal
symptoms. These symptoms include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea
and vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps.
