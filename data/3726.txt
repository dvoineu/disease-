# Sports physical

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

A person gets a sports physical by a health care provider to find out if it is
safe to start a new sport or a new sports season. Most states require a sports
physical before children and teens can play.

Sports physicals do not take the place of regular medical care or routine
checkups.

## Why Do You Need a Sports Physical?

The sports physical is done to:

    * Find out if you are in good health
    * Measure the maturity of your body
    * Measure your physical fitness
    * Learn about injuries you have now
    * Find conditions you may have been born with that could make you more likely to be injured 

The provider can give advice on how to protect yourself from injury while
playing a sport, and how to safely play with a medical condition or chronic
illness. For example, if you have asthma, you may need a change in medicine to
better control it while playing sports.

## What Happens During a Sports Physical?

Providers may perform sports physicals differently from one another. But they
always include a conversation about your medical history and a physical exam.

Your provider will want to know about your health, your family's health, your
medical problems, and what medicines you take.

The physical exam is similar to your annual checkup, but with some added
things that relate to playing sports. The provider will focus on the health of
your lungs, heart, bones, and joints. Your provider may:

    * Measure your height and weight
    * Measure your blood pressure and pulse
    * Test your vision
    * Check your heart, lungs, belly, ears, nose, and throat
    * Check your joints, strength, flexibility, and posture 

Your provider may ask about:

    * Your diet
    * Your use of drugs, alcohol, and supplements
    * Your menstrual periods if you're a girl or woman 

## What Information Should You Bring to the Visit?

If you get a form for your medical history, fill it out and bring it with you.
If not, bring this information with you:

    * Allergies and what kind of reactions you have had
    * A list of the immunization shots you have had, with the dates you had them
    * A list of medicines you take, including prescription, over-the-counter, and supplements (such as vitamins, minerals, and herbs)
    * If you use contact lenses, dental appliances, orthotics, or have piercings
    * Illnesses you had in the past or have now
    * Injuries you have had, including concussions, broken bones, dislocated bones
    * Hospitalizations or surgeries you have had
    * Times you passed out, felt dizzy, had chest pain, had heat illness, or had trouble breathing during exercise
    * Illnesses in your family, including any deaths related to exercise or sports
    * A history of your weight loss or gain over time
