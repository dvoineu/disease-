## Summary

Most of us see our world in color. We enjoy looking at a lush green lawn or a
red rose in full bloom. If you have a color vision defect, you may see these
colors differently than most people.

There are three main kinds of color vision defects. Red-green color vision
defects are the most common. This type occurs in men more than in women. The
other major types are blue-yellow color vision defects and a complete absence
of color vision.

Most of the time, color blindness is genetic. There is no treatment, but most
people adjust and the condition doesn't limit their activities.
