# Goals & Strategy for Development of a Comprehensive Waterborne Burden
Disease Estimate

Minus

Related Pages

The goal of developing a waterborne disease burden estimate is to provide a
measure of illness, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare costs associated
with waterborne diseases and syndromes in the U.S., considering all types of
water exposures and disease outcomes.

Looking at All Waterborne Diseases

Waterborne diseases can affect a variety of body systems, and there is a need
to develop an estimate that includes all types of waterborne disease, not just
acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI, includes vomiting and diarrhea).

Waterborne diseases can cause more than gastrointestinal illnesses. There is a
whole spectrum of illnesses that can be spread through water, including ear,
eye, skin, respiratory, and wound infections. Waterborne diseases and
syndromes can affect multiple body systems and overall physical health.

Attributing Illnesses to Sources

Many pathogens that cause waterborne disease can also be transmitted by other
sources, such as through contaminated foods or contact with infected animals
or people. It is important that a waterborne disease burden estimate be
consistent with all possible sources of illness.

The process of estimating the specific source responsible for illness is
called **attribution.** The attribution process will result in an estimate of
what percentage of illness is due to each possible source (food, water,
infected animals and people, or other sources.) This percentage may vary for
each pathogen since some pathogens are primarily spread by water and others
are only partially spread by water. For example, _Salmonella_ is more likely
to be spread by contaminated food, while some amebae, such as _Naegleria
fowleri_ _,_ are primarily spread through water.

Once an illness is attributed to a water exposure, a secondary aim is to
determine the source of the water exposure. This is challenging because a
person may be exposed to numerous water sources in a short time period (for
example, it is likely for a person to be exposed to drinking and environmental
water sources in the same day.)

![Attribution pie chart showing how attribution determines what percentage of
selected pathogen infections are linked to contaminated water and what
percentage of the waterborne infections are linked to different water types.
Food is 50%, Water 25%, Person to Person 15%, Animal to Person 10%. The water
wedge breaks down in to a smaller pie chart showing 60% due to drinking water,
recreational water 25%, and environmental
15%.](/healthywater/images/attribution-goal-piechart.jpg)

These figures show the type of information attribution will illustrate. They
are an example and do not come from existing data.

It is often difficult to determine the specific water source responsible for
the illness, or whether water is responsible at all. Not everyone who is
exposed to a waterborne pathogen will become sick, and people usually do not
know what made them sick. Ongoing studies and partnerships with other
researchers will likely be needed to help expand and improve the analytical
methods and evidence base.

### Strategy for Developing a Waterborne Disease Burden Estimate

Take advantage of large, publicly available databases

Death certificates, administrative (insurance claims) databases, and
nationally representative surveys of health care providers are useful for
estimating waterborne disease because these sources provide large, nationally
representative samples. Since these data sources are based on national
insurance claims and health care provider records, the illness estimates can
approximate the U.S. population without being adjusted to account for
individuals that are not detected or diagnosed. Multiple pathogens can be
compared using a single data source, and the different data sources can be
compared to each other to verify results and account for the limitations of
each data source. Some of these data sources also provide information on
patient characteristics, which can be used to determine which populations are
more vulnerable to waterborne disease.

CDC's Waterborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) is a helpful
tool for monitoring illness trends, determining exposure routes and risk
factors, and planning for interventions. However, since not all outbreaks are
recognized, investigated, or reported, and there is no way to know how many
outbreaks go undetected, this data source cannot be used to estimate the
amount of waterborne illness in the U.S.

![Case reporting pyramid](/healthywater/images/case-reporting-pyramid.jpg)

The outbreak surveillance pyramid illustrates why outbreak surveillance data
does not include all waterborne disease. Most people do not seek health care
for their illnesses, and even among individuals who seek care, many do not
have any laboratory testing. Laboratory testing does not always identify a
pathogen, and even when a specific pathogen is identified, physicians may not
report all illnesses to public health departments. Further, it may not be
evident that patients are connected to a common exposure, so many outbreaks go
undetected and unreported.

In addition to systematic challenges with outbreak reporting, these data do
not measure sporadic (infections not linked to an outbreak) cases of
waterborne illness, which provide an important contribution to the burden of
waterborne illness in the U.S.

Focus on a subset of pathogens and diagnoses with the best data

The waterborne disease burden estimate will focus on partially and primarily
waterborne pathogens that are 1) largely driving waterborne illness in the
U.S. and 2) likely to be reported to a healthcare professional. Pathogen
selection was informed by previous studies and national outbreak data.

The following pathogens will be used to estimate the burden of waterborne
disease in the U.S. Some of these pathogens are more likely to be transmitted
by water (for example, _Naegleria fowleri_ or _Legionella_ ) than others (for
example, _Salmonella_ or _E. coli._ ) The attribution process will determine
the percentage of pathogen infections that are due to contaminated water.

Initially focus on compiling numbers of outcomes

CDC researchers published a manuscript in 2012External describing the
frequency and costs of hospitalizations and outpatient visits for ten
waterborne diseases 1. Future publications will build on this analysis to
include the frequency and costs of emergency room visits for selected
waterborne diseases. An additional step will be to estimate the annual number
of hospitalizations, deaths, and community illnesses for these selected
waterborne diseases and syndromes. These analyses will determine the baseline
level of potentially waterborne illness in the U.S. and will inform which
pathogens are responsible for the most illnesses and the greatest health care
costs. After establishing the number of illnesses, it will be possible to
focus on the how much of this illness is spread via water (attribution).

Address data challenges and limitations

There are limitations to using death certificates, administrative (insurance
claims) data, and health surveys.

Form research partnerships to tackle analytical challenges

Developing a comprehensive waterborne disease burden estimate will require
building on the existing evidence base and forming strong partnerships with
researchers throughout the water and public health sectors.

The 2012 Water and Health ConferenceExternal, hosted by the Institute for the
Environment and the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, provided a forum for public health, environmental health, and
water industry representatives to discuss the benefits and strategies for
developing a waterborne disease burden estimate. More than 40 participants
attended the waterborne disease burden workshop and requested continued
involvement and communication about the project. These multidisciplinary
public health agency and research partnerships are essential to improving
analytical methods needed to address
