## Summary

Chiropractic is a health care profession. Chiropractors perform adjustments
(manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal is to
correct alignment problems, ease pain, and support the body's natural ability
to heal itself. They may also use other treatments including

    * Heat and ice
    * Electrical stimulation
    * Relaxation techniques
    * Rehabilitative and general exercise
    * Counseling about diet, weight loss, and other lifestyle factors
    * Dietary supplements

Many people visit chiropractors for treatment of low back pain, neck pain, and
headaches.
