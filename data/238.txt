## Summary

Though many people are afraid of spiders, they rarely bite people unless
threatened. Most spider bites are harmless. Occasionally, spider bites can
cause allergic reactions. And bites by the venomous black widow and brown
recluse spiders can be very dangerous to people.

If you are bitten by a spider, you may see a reaction similar to that of a bee
sting, including redness, pain and swelling at the site. To treat a spider
bite:

  * Wash the area well with soap and water
  * Apply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area
  * Take over-the-counter pain medicine, if needed
  * Consider using antihistamines for severe swelling
  * Seek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms
