The 100-year anniversary of the 1918 pandemic and the 10-year anniversary of
the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are milestones that provide an opportunity to reflect
on the groundbreaking work that led to the discovery, sequencing and
reconstruction of the 1918 pandemic flu virus. This collaborative effort
advanced understanding of the deadliest flu pandemic in modern history and has
helped the global public health community prepare for contemporary pandemics,
such as 2009 H1N1, as well as future pandemic threats.

The 1918 H1N1 flu pandemic, sometimes referred to as the "Spanish flu," killed
an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including an estimated 675,000
people in the United States.1,2,3,4 An unusual characteristic of this virus
was the high death rate it caused among healthy adults 15 to 34 years of age.3
The pandemic lowered the average life expectancy in the United States by more
than 12 years.3 A comparable death rate has not been observed during any of
the known flu seasons or pandemics that have occurred either prior to or
following the 1918 pandemic.3

The virus' unique severity puzzled researchers for decades, and prompted
several questions, such as "Why was the 1918 virus so deadly?", "Where did the
virus originate from?", and "What can the public health community learn from
the 1918 virus to better prepare for and defend against future pandemics?"
These questions drove an expert group of researchers and virus hunters to
search for the lost 1918 virus, sequence its genome, recreate the virus in a
highly safe and regulated laboratory setting at CDC, and ultimately study its
secrets to better prepare for future pandemics. The following is a historical
recounting of these efforts, complete with references and descriptions of the
contributions made by all of the remarkable men and women involved.

For decades, the 1918 virus was lost to history, a relic of a time when the
understanding of infectious pathogens and the tools to study them were still
in their infancy. Following the 1918 pandemic, generations of scientists and
public health experts were left with only the epidemiological evidence of the
1918 pandemic virus' lethality and the deleterious impact it had on global
populations. A small ocean-side village in Alaska called Brevig Mission would
become both testament to this deadly legacy as well as crucial to the 1918
virus' eventual discovery.

Today, fewer than 400 people live in Brevig Mission, but in the fall of 1918,
around 80 adults lived there, mostly Inuit Natives. While different narratives
exist as to how the 1918 virus came to reach the small village - whether by
traders from a nearby city who traveled via dog-pulled sleds or even by a
local mail delivery person - its impact on the village's population is well
documented. During the five-day period from November 15-20, 1918, the 1918
pandemic claimed the lives of 72 of the villages' 80 adult inhabitants.

Later, at the order of the local government, a mass grave site marked only by
small white crosses was created on a hill beside the village - a grim monument
to a community all but erased from existence. The grave was frozen in
permafrost and left untouched until 1951. That year, Johan Hultin, a 25-year-
old Swedish microbiologist and Ph.D. student at the University of Iowa, set
out on an expedition to Brevig Mission in the hopes of finding the 1918 virus
and in the process unearth new insights and answers. Hultin believed that
within that preserved burial ground he might still find traces of the 1918
virus itself, frozen in time within the tissues of the villagers whose lives
it had claimed.

In 1951, Hultin successfully obtained permission from the village elders to
excavate the Brevig Mission burial site. With the help of several of his
university colleagues, Hultin set up a dig site over the grave. The excavation
took days, as Hultin had to create campfires to thaw the earth enough to allow
for digging. Two days in, Hultin came across the body of a little girl -- her
body was still preserved wearing a blue dress, and her hair was adorned with
red ribbons5. Ultimately, Hultin successfully obtained lung tissue from four
additional bodies buried at the site, but logistical and technological
limitations of the time period would prove formidable.

In a conversation Hultin had decades later with CDC microbiologist Dr.
Terrence Tumpey (see part III - the reconstruction), Hultin would explain how
during the return trip from Alaska to the University of Iowa, he flew on a
DC-3 propeller-driven airplane that was forced to make multiple stops along
the trip to refuel. During each stop, Hultin - ever resourceful - would
deboard the plane and attempt to re-freeze the lung samples using carbon
dioxide from a fire extinguisher.

The noise generated from this activity apparently drew puzzled glances from
fellow passengers and onlookers. Once back in Iowa, Hultin attempted to inject
the lung tissue into chicken eggs to get the virus to grow.5 It did not. In
the end, perhaps unsurprisingly, Hultin was unable to retrieve the 1918 virus
from this initial attempt.

It wouldn't be until 46 years later, in 1997, that Hultin would have another
opportunity to pursue the 1918 virus. That year, Hultin came across an article
in the journal _Science_ authored by Jeffery Taubenberger et al. entitled,
"Initial Genetic Characterization of the 1918 "Spanish" Influenza Virus."6 At
the time, Dr. Taubenberger was a young molecular pathologist working for the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C.

In the article, Taubenberger and his team described their initial work to
sequence part of the genome of the 1918 virus. The genome is the complete list
of genetic instructions that make up an organism, similar to a blueprint used
for construction. Many people are familiar with the concept of DNA, which is
dual-stranded and determines the fundamental genetic characteristics of nearly
all living things. However, the genome of an influenza virus consists of
single-stranded RNA instead. Taubenberger's team team successfully extracted
RNA of the 1918 virus from lung tissue obtained from a 21-year-old male U.S.
service member stationed in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The serviceman had
been admitted to the camp's hospital on September 20, 1918, with a diagnosis
of influenza infection and pneumonia. He died six days later on September 26,
1918, and a sample of his lung tissue was collected and preserved for later
study.

From this tissue, Taubenberger's group was able to sequence nine fragments of
viral RNA from four of the virus' eight gene segments. This work did not
represent a complete sequence of the entire 1918 virus' genome, but it
provided a clearer picture of the pandemic virus than ever before. Based on
the 1918 virus' sequence data Taubenberger assembled in 1997, he and his
fellow researchers initially claimed that the 1918 virus was a novel influenza
A (H1N1) virus that belonged to a subgroup of viruses that came from humans
and pigs, as opposed to birds.6 However, there was still much to learn about
the virus.

After reading Taubenberger's article, Hultin once again became inspired to
attempt to recover the 1918 virus. Hultin wrote a letter to Taubenberger,
asking if Taubenberger would be interested if he could return to Brevig
Mission and obtain lung tissues from victims of the 1918 virus buried in the
Alaskan permafrost. During a return phone call, Taubenberger responded, yes. A
week later, Hultin departed for Brevig Mission once again with meager tools
for the task. He famously borrowed his wife's garden shears to assist in the
excavation.

Forty-six years had passed since Hultin's first trip to the gravesite, and he
was now 72 years old. He once again sought permission to excavate the
gravesite from the village council -- which he obtained -- and he also hired
locals to assist in the work. Hultin paid for the trip himself at a personal
cost of about $3,200.7 The excavation took about five days, but this time
Hultin made a remarkable find.

Buried and preserved by the permafrost about 7 feet deep was the body of an
Inuit woman that Hultin named "Lucy." Lucy, Hultin would learn, was an obese
woman who likely died in her mid-20s due to complications from the 1918 virus.
Her lungs were perfectly frozen and preserved in the Alaskan permafrost.
Hultin removed them, placed them in preserving fluid, and later shipped them
separately to Taubenberger and his fellow researchers, including Dr. Ann Reid,
at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.5 Ten days later, Hultin received a
call from the scientists to confirm -- to perhaps everyone's collective
astonishment -- that positive 1918 virus genetic material had indeed been
obtained from Lucy's lung tissue.

The initial impact of this discovery would first be described in a February
1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS)
journal entitled "Origin and evolution of the 1918 "Spanish" influenza virus
hemagglutinin gene," by Ann Reid et al. 8 Hultin was acknowledged as a co-
author. In the paper, the authors described their effort to sequence (i.e.,
characterize) the 1918 virus's hemagglutinin "HA" gene.

The HA gene of an influenza virus determines the properties of the virus's HA
surface proteins. These HA surface proteins allow an influenza virus to enter
and infect a healthy respiratory tract cell. HA is also targeted by antibodies
produced by the immune system to fight infection.  Modern flu vaccines work by
targeting an influenza virus' unique HA (a fact that virologist Dr. Peter
Palese, featured later in this article, helped pioneer).

In the 1999 study, the authors succeeded in sequencing the full length HA gene
sequence of the 1918 virus. To accomplish this, the authors used RNA fragments
of the virus obtained from the bodies of the formerly described 21-year-old
Fort Jackson service member, "Lucy" from Brevik Mission, and a third person, a
30-year-old male service member stationed at Camp Upton, New York. This man
was admitted to the camp hospital with influenza on September 23, 1918, had a
rapid clinical course of illness, and died from acute respiratory failure on
September 26, 2018.

Sequencing results suggested that the ancestor of the 1918 virus infected
humans sometime between 1900 and 1915. Drs. Reid and Taubenberger noted that
the 1918 HA gene had a number of mammalian as opposed to avian adaptations,
and was more human-like or swine-like depending on the method of analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis, which is used to group influenza viruses in accordance
with their evolutionary development and diversity, placed the 1918 virus' HA
within and around the root of the mammalian clade. This means that it likely
was an ancestor or closely related to the earliest influenza viruses known to
infect mammals. However, the authors believed the virus likely obtained its HA
from avian viruses, but were unsure how long the virus may have been adapting
in a mammalian host before emerging in pandemic form.

According to the authors, the existing strain to which the 1918 virus
sequences were most closely related was "A/sw/Iowa/30," the oldest classical
swine influenza strain. The authors noted that contemporary avian influenza
virus strains are very different from the 1918 pandemic virus, and
unfortunately older avian strains from around the time of the 1918 pandemic
were not available for study. The authors also noted that the 1918 virus' HA1
had only four glycosylation sites, which is different from modern human HA's
which have accumulated up to five additional glycosylation sites through the
process of antigenic drift. Antigenic drift refers to small changes in the
genes of influenza viruses that happen continually over times as the virus
copies itself. Antigenic drift is one reason why there is a flu season every
year and also a reason for why people can get the flu multiple times in their
lifetime.

Glycosylation sites are believed to be necessary for the function of influenza
viruses, and the inclusion of additional glycosylation sites is believed to be
an adaptation of the virus to human hosts. Also of note, the authors did not
see any genetic changes in the 1918 virus' HA that would explain its
exceptional virulence.

Unlike modern virulent avian influenza strains, such as avian influenza A (H5)
and (H7) viruses, the 1918 virus' HA did not possess a "cleavage site"
mutation, which is a recognized genetic marker for virulence, i.e., the
severity or harmfulness of a disease. The insertion of amino acids in the HA
cleavage site can allow an influenza virus to grow in tissues outside of its
normal host cells. In the absence of such obvious markers, Dr. Reid and her
fellow researchers concluded that there were likely multiple genetic factors
responsible for the 1918 virus' severity.

A follow-up paper published in June 2000, entitled "Characterization of the
1918 "Spanish" Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Gene," described sequencing of
the 1918 virus' neuraminidase (NA) gene.9 In an influenza virus, the
neuraminidase gene is responsible for coding the virus' NA surface proteins
(see prior virus image for reference). An influenza virus' NA surface proteins
allow an influenza virus to escape an infected cell and infect other cells.
Therefore, it plays an important role in spreading influenza infection. The
author noted that NA is also targeted by the immune system, and that
antibodies against NA do not prevent infection, but they do significantly
limit the ability of the virus to spread.

Of note, the authors were able to sequence the entire code of the 1918 virus'
NA from the virus sample obtained from "Lucy's" body. So here again, Hultin's
work proved invaluable. The authors found that the NA gene of the 1918 virus
shared many sequence and structural characteristics with both mammalian and
avian influenza virus strains.9 Phylogenetic analysis suggested the NA gene of
the 1918 virus was intermediately located between mammals and birds,
suggesting that it likely was introduced into mammals shortly before the 1918
pandemic. Furthermore, the 1918 virus' NA obtained from Lucy suggested that it
is very similar to the ancestor of all subsequent swine and human isolates.9

Overall, the phylogenetic analysis seemed to indicate that the ultimate source
of the 1918 virus' NA was avian in nature, but the authors couldn't determine
the pathway from its avian source to the virus' final pandemic form. Regarding
genetic features of the NA that could explain the 1918 virus' severity, the
researchers were once again unable to find any single feature of the 1918 NA
that contributed to the virus' virulence.9 For example, in some modern
influenza viruses, the loss of a glycosylation site in NA at amino acid 146
(in WSN/33) contributes to virulence and also results in the virus attacking
the nervous system in mice. However, this change was not found in the NA of
the 1918 virus.

Following this study, a series of additional studies were published, each
detailing the findings from each of the 1918 virus' remaining genes (flu
viruses have 8 genes in total). In 2001, a paper by Christopher Basler et al.
published in the Proceedings of the National Academic of Science (PNAS)
described the sequencing of the 1918 virus' nonstructural (NS) gene.10 A 2002
study in the Journal of Virology by Ann Reid et al. described sequencing of
the virus' matrix gene.11 Two years later, a 2004 Journal of Virology study
described the sequencing of the 1918 virus' nucleoprotein (NP) gene.12 In
2005, the virus' polymerase genes were sequenced by Taubenberger et al and
described in a Nature article.13 This final study bookended the nearly decade
long process of sequencing the entire genome of the 1918 virus.

With the entire genome of the 1918 virus now sequenced, the necessary
information was in place to reconstruct a live version of the 1918 virus.
However, one more intermediate step was needed to start the reverse genetics
process, which was to create plasmids for each of the 1918 virus' eight gene
segments.

This task was undertaken by renowned microbiologist, Dr. Peter Palese and Dr.
Adolfo Garcia-Sastre at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. A
plasmid is a small circular DNA strand that can be amplified (or replicated)
in the laboratory. Years earlier, Dr. Palese helped pioneer the use of
plasmids in reverse genetics to produce viable influenza viruses. The
techniques he developed allowed the relationships between the structure and
function of viral genes to be studied, and these efforts paved the way for the
techniques used to reconstruct the 1918 virus. Once Dr. Palese and his
colleagues at Mount Sinai completed creation of the plasmids, they were
shipped to CDC so the official process of reconstruction could begin.

### **The Reconstruction**

The decision to reconstruct the deadliest pandemic flu virus of the 20th
century was made with considerable care and attention to safety. Senior
government officials decided on CDC headquarters in Atlanta as the location of
the reconstruction.  CDC conducted two tiers of approvals: first by CDC's
Institutional Biosafety Committee and the second by CDC's Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee, before work in the laboratory began. The work would be
performed using stringent biosafety and biosecurity precautions and
facilities, including what's known as Biosecurity Level 3 (BSL-3) practices
and facilities with enhancements.

For reference, there are four biosafety levels that correspond to the degree
of risk posed by research, with 1 posing the least risk and 4 posing the
greatest risk. Each biosecurity level also corresponds with specific
laboratory practices and techniques, personnel training requirements,
laboratory equipment, and laboratory facilities that are appropriate for the
operations being performed. The stringency of these considerations - again
ranging from 1 as the lowest to 4 as the highest -- is designed to protect the
personnel performing the work, the environment and the community.

Each biosecurity level includes considerations for what is known as "primary"
and "secondary" barriers. Examples of primary barriers include safety
cabinets, isolation chambers, gloves and gowns, whereas secondary barriers
include considerations such as the construction of the facility and HEPA
filtration of air in the laboratory. The specific criteria for each biosafety
level are detailed in the CDC/NIH publication Biosafety in Microbiological and
Biomedical Laboratories.

A BSL3 laboratory with enhancements includes a number of primary and secondary
barriers and other considerations. For example, all personnel must wear a
powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), double gloves, scrubs, shoe covers
and a surgical gown. They also must shower before exiting the laboratory. In
addition, all work with the virus or animals must be conducted within a
certified Class II biosafety cabinet (BSC), and airflow within the laboratory
is directionally controlled and filtered so that it cannot accidentally exit
the laboratory.

For the reconstruction of the 1918 virus, additional rules were created to
govern the experiments to be conducted. For example, to prevent mix-ups and
cross-contamination, work on the 1918 virus could not take place alongside
work on other influenza viruses.

As part of security and safety considerations, CDC's Office of the Director
determined that only one person would be granted permission, laboratory
access, and the tremendous responsibility of reconstructing the 1918 virus.
That person was trained microbiologist Dr. Terrence Tumpey, who was approved
for the project by then CDC director, Dr. Julie Gerberding. Reconstruction of
the 1918 virus also was approved by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease (NIAID) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
which partially funded the project.

Dr. Tumpey was formerly a U.S. Department of Agriculture microbiologist at the
Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Earlier in his
career, he had applied for an American Society of Microbiology (ASM)
postdoctoral fellowship with CDC microbiologist and flu expert Dr. Jacqueline
Katz, who recently retired as Deputy Director of CDC's Influenza Division.
This two-year fellowship in CDC's Influenza Division would mark the beginning
of Dr. Tumpey's career at CDC. He officially transferred employment to CDC for
the purpose of studying human health implications of influenza viruses,
including the 1918 pandemic virus.

Dr. Tumpey's work to reconstruct the complete 1918 virus began in the summer
of 2005. To reduce risk to colleagues and the public, he was required to work
on the virus alone and only after hours when fellow colleagues had exited the
laboratories for the day and gone home. A biometric fingerprint scan was
required for access into the BSL-3E laboratory, and the virus storage freezers
were only accessible via an iris scan of his eyes. Dr. Tumpey was required to
take a prescribed prophylactic (preventative) daily dose of the influenza
antiviral drug, oseltamivir, as an additional safety precaution to prevent him
from becoming infected. Should he become infected, he was informed that he
would be placed in quarantine and denied contact with the outside world. He
understood and accepted this responsibility and its consequences.

Using reverse genetics, Dr. Tumpey took the plasmids created by Dr. Palese for
each of the 1918 virus' eight gene segments and inserted them into human
kidney cells. The plasmids then instructed the cells to reconstruct the RNA of
the complete 1918 virus. For multiple weeks in July 2005, colleagues and
collaborators asked Dr. Tumpey if he had the 1918 virus and if it had appeared
in cell-culture yet.

On the day the 1918 virus appeared in his cell-culture, Dr. Tumpey knew
history had been made, and in fact, a historic virus had been brought back
from extinction. He sent a playful, Neil Armstrong-inspired email later that
day to colleagues and collaborators, which simply said "That's one small step
for man, one giant leap for mankind." Everyone then knew what had been
accomplished. Dr. Tumpey had become the first man to reconstruct the complete
1918 virus. The next step was to study it and unlock its deadly secrets.

Laboratory studies on the reconstructed 1918 virus began in August 2005. A
report of this work, "Characterization of the Reconstructed 1918 Spanish
Influenza Pandemic Virus", was published in the October 7, 2005, issue of
Science.14 To evaluate the 1918 virus' pathogenicity (i.e., the ability of the
virus to cause disease and harm a host), animal studies involving mice were
conducted. The mice were infected with the 1918 virus, and measures of
morbidity (i.e., weight loss, virus replication, and 50% lethal dose titers)
were collected and documented. For comparison, other mice were infected with
different influenza viruses that were designed via reverse genetics to have
varying combinations of genes from the 1918 virus and contemporary human
seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses. These viruses are called "recombinant
viruses."

The fully reconstructed 1918 virus was striking in terms of its ability to
quickly replicate, i.e., make copies of itself and spread infection in the
lungs of infected mice. For example, four days after infection, the amount of
1918 virus found in the lung tissue of infected mice was 39,000 times higher
than that produced by one of the comparison recombinant flu viruses.14

Furthermore, the 1918 virus was highly lethal in the mice. Some mice died
within three days of infection with the 1918 virus, and the mice lost up to
13% of their body weight within two days of infection with the 1918 virus. The
1918 virus was at least 100 times more lethal than one of the other
recombinant viruses tested.14 Experiments indicated that 1918 virus' HA gene
played a large role in its severity. When the HA gene of the 1918 virus was
swapped with that of a contemporary human seasonal influenza A (H1N1) flu
virus known as "A/Texas/36/91" or Tx/91 for short, and combined with the
remaining seven genes of the 1918 virus, the resulting recombinant virus
notably did not kill infected mice and did not result in significant weight
loss.14

Other experiments were conducted to determine if infection with the 1918 virus
could spread to other vital organs of mice -- such as the brain, heart, liver
and spleen. Laboratory testing did not detect virus in these organs,
suggesting that the 1918 virus did not cause systemic infection in its
victims.

However, one well-documented effect of the 1918 virus was rapid and severe
lung damage. In 1918, victims of the pandemic virus experienced fluid-filled
lungs, as well as severe pneumonia and lung tissue inflammation.  Within four
days post infection, mice infected with the 1918 virus experienced similar
lung complications, suggesting that this was a unique aspect of the 1918
virus' severity.14

The impact of the 1918 virus on lung tissue was also studied using a human
lung cell line (known as Calu-3 cells). The amount of 1918 flu virus was
measured in the cells at 12, 16 and 24 hours post infection and these results
were compared to those produced by recombinant viruses with a combination of
genes from the 1918 virus mixed with genes from contemporary human seasonal
flu viruses. Similar to the experiments involving mice, the 1918 virus quickly
multiplied and spread within the human lung cells. So much so, that the 1918
virus produced as much as 50 times the amount of virus in human lung cells as
one of the comparison viruses. These experiments suggested that in addition to
the HA, the polymerase genes of the 1918 virus played a significant role in
the virus' infectivity and virulence in human lung tissue.14

Another set of experiments was conducted to better understand the possible
avian origins of the 1918 virus. The earlier sequencing efforts led by Dr.
Taubenberger and Reid had suggested that the 1918 virus' gene segments were
more closely related to avian influenza A(H1N1) viruses than H1N1 viruses
found in other mammals. Researchers were interested to know whether the 1918
virus would be lethal to fertilized chicken eggs, i.e., chicken eggs
containing an embryo, similar to modern highly pathogenic avian influenza
viruses.

To find an answer, 10-day old fertilized chicken eggs were inoculated with the
1918 virus. The 1918 virus proved lethal for the chicken egg embryos, similar
to the effects caused by contemporary H1N1 bird flu viruses.14 Notably,
comparison experiments using human seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses did not
have this destructive effect on chicken embryos. Furthermore, the recombinant
flu viruses that Dr. Tumpey created containing two, five or seven genes of the
1918 virus also did not hurt chicken embryos.14 Similar to the results of the
studies conducted in mice and human lung cell, these fertilized chicken egg
experiments indicated that the HA and polymerase genes of the 1918 virus both
likely played roles in its virulence.

The work conducted by Dr. Tumpey and his CDC colleagues provided new
information about the properties that contributed to the virulence of the 1918
virus. Dr. Tumpey determined that the HA and PB1 virus genes of the virus
played particularly important roles in its infectiousness and severity.
However, as his experiments involving recombinant flu viruses with some but
not all of the 1918 virus's genes showed, it was not any single component of
the 1918 virus but instead the unique combination of all of its genes together
that made it so particularly dangerous.

Tumpey and colleagues wrote "the constellation of all eight genes together
make an exceptionally virulent virus."14 No other human influenza viruses
tested were as exceptionally virulent. In that way, the 1918 virus was special
- a uniquely deadly product of nature, evolution and the intermingling of
people and animals. It would serve as a portent of nature's ability to produce
future pandemics of varying public health concern and origin.

Since 1918, the world has experienced three additional pandemics, in 1957,
1968, and most recently in 2009. These subsequent pandemics were less severe
and caused considerably lower mortality rates than the 1918 pandemic.2,3,4 The
1957 H2N2 pandemic and the 1968 H3N2 pandemic each resulted in an estimated 1
million global deaths, while the 2009 H1N1 pandemic resulted in fewer than 0.3
million deaths in its first year.3,4 This perhaps begs the question of whether
a high severity pandemic on the scale of 1918 could occur in modern times.

Many experts think so. One virus in particular has garnered international
attention and concern: the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from China. The H7N9
virus has so far caused 1,568 human infections in China with a case-fatality
proportion of about 39% since 2013. However, it has not gained the capability
to spread quickly and efficiently between people. If it did, experts believe
it could result in a pandemic with severity comparable to the 1918 pandemic.
So far, it has shown only limited ability to spread between people. Most human
infections with this virus have result from exposure to birds.

When considering the potential for a modern era high severity pandemic, it is
important; however, to reflect on the considerable medical, scientific and
societal advancements that have occurred since 1918, while recognizing that
there are a number of ways that global preparations for the next pandemic
still warrant improvement.

Besides the properties of the virus itself, many additional factors
contributed to the virulence of the 1918 pandemic. In 1918, the world was
still engaged in World War I. Movement and mobilization of troops placed large
numbers of people in close contact and living spaces were overcrowded. Health
services were limited, and up to 30% of U.S. physicians were deployed to
military service.3

In addition, medical technology and countermeasures at the time were limited
or non-existent. No diagnostic tests existed at the time that could test for
influenza infection. In fact, doctors didn't know influenza viruses existed.
Many health experts at the time thought the 1918 pandemic was caused by a
bacterium called "Pfeiffer's bacillus," which is now known as Haemophilus
influenzae.

Influenza vaccines did not exist at the time, and even antibiotics had not
been developed yet. For example, penicillin was not discovered until 1928.
Likewise, no flu antiviral drugs were available. Critical care measures, such
as intensive care support and mechanical ventilation also were not available
in 1918.4 Without these medical countermeasures and treatment capabilities,
doctors were left with few treatment options other than supportive care.3

In terms of national, state and local pandemic planning, no coordinated
pandemic plans existed in 1918. Some cities managed to implement community
mitigation measures, such as closing schools, banning public gatherings, and
issuing isolation or quarantine orders, but the federal government had no
centralized role in helping to plan or initiate these interventions during the
1918 pandemic.3

Today, considerable advancements have been made in the areas of health
technology, disease surveillance, medical care, medicines and drugs, vaccines
and pandemic planning. Flu vaccines are now produced and updated yearly, and
yearly vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.
Antiviral drugs now exist that treat flu illness, and in the event of virus
exposure, can be used for prophylaxis (prevention), as well. Importantly, many
different antibiotics are now available that can be used to treat secondary
bacterial infections.

Diagnostic tests for identifying influenza are now available and they are
improving over time. Current rapid tests for flu, also known as RIDTs, provide
results within 15 minutes and have sensitivities ranging from 50-70%.
Recently, new "rapid molecular assays" have become available that are timely
and much more accurate than RIDTs. Just as important as these advancements in
diagnostic tests are the improvements that have been made in laboratory
testing capacity both within the United States and globally.

The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Influenza Surveillance and
Response System (GISRS) is a global flu surveillance network that monitors
changes in seasonal flu viruses and also monitors the emergence of novel
(i.e., new in humans) flu viruses, many of which originate from animal
populations. Through animal and human interactions and environmental
exposures, these viruses can cause human infections. CDC in Atlanta is one of
WHO's six Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza
(joining others in Australia, China, Japan and the United Kingdom). The WHO
collaborating centers collect influenza viruses obtained from respiratory
specimens from patients around the world, and they are supported by 143
National Influenza Centers in 114 WHO member countries.3

Expanding laboratory testing and flu surveillance capacity around the world
has been an important focus of pandemic preparedness efforts. In 2004, CDC
began an international surveillance capacity building initiative that entailed
a 5-year period of financial support to improve laboratory diagnostic tests
and surveillance of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI) in 39 partner countries.

In 2008, CDC established the International Reagent Resource (IRR), which
provides reagents to laboratories around the world to identify seasonal
influenza A and B viruses, as well as novel influenza A viruses. During the
2009 H1N1 pandemic, the IRR distributed a new CDC developed 2009 H1N1 PCR
assay to domestic public health laboratories and laboratories around the world
less than 2 weeks after the 2009 H1N1 virus was first identified. This
considerably enhanced the ability of the global flu surveillance community to
track spread of the virus.3

As part of WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), countries must notify
WHO within 24 hours of any case of human infection caused by a novel influenza
A virus subtype. This requirement is designed to help quickly identify
emerging viruses with pandemic potential.

Since 2010, CDC has used its Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) to evaluate
and score emerging novel influenza A viruses and other viruses of potential
public health concern. The score provided by the IRAT answers two questions:
1) What is the risk that a virus that is novel in humans could result in
sustained human to human transmission? and: 2) What is the potential for the
virus to substantially impact public health if it does gain the ability to
spread efficiently from person to person? Results from the IRAT have helped
public health experts target pandemic preparedness resources against the
greatest disease threats and to prioritize the selection of candidate vaccine
viruses and the development of pre-pandemic vaccines against emergent viruses
with the greatest potential to cause a severe pandemic.

When pre-pandemic vaccines are made, they are stored in the Strategic National
Stockpile, along with facemasks, antiviral drugs and other materials that can
be used in case of a pandemic.

All of these resources, tools, technologies, programs and activities are
excellent tools for pandemic planning, and pandemic planning itself has
improved significantly since 1918. In the United States, the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains a national Pandemic Influenza Plan,
and this plan was updated in 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
published instructions for countries to use in developing their own national
pandemic plans, as well as a checklist for pandemic influenza risk and impact
management.3

Planners have access to other materials as well. For example, in 2014, CDC
published a pandemic framework with six intervals that fall within a pandemic
curve. Each interval helps with prioritizing data collection, government
resources and interventions, and other important activities during the
pandemic. In addition, CDC experts have devised a Pandemic Severity Assessment
Framework that uses data to assign severity and transmissibility scores to
pandemics. The tool is useful for planning purposes and for determining
appropriate mitigations based on the severity of a pandemic. In addition,
guidelines for non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as closing schools and
large social gatherings, have been established and revised, for use during a
pandemic.

While all of these plans, resources, products and improvements show that
significant progress has been made since 1918, gaps remain, and a severe
pandemic could still be devastating to populations globally. In 1918, the
world population was 1.8 billion people. One hundred years later, the world
population has grown to 7.6 billion people in 2018.3 As human populations have
risen, so have swine and poultry populations as a means to feed them. This
expanded number of hosts provides increased opportunities for novel influenza
viruses from birds and pigs to spread, evolve and infect people. Global
movement of people and goods also has increased, allowing the latest disease
threat to be an international plane flight away. Due to the mobility and
expansion of human populations, even once exotic pathogens, like Ebola, which
previously affected only people living in remote villages of the African
jungle, now have managed to find their way into urban areas, causing large
outbreaks.

If a severe pandemic, such as occurred in 1918 happened today, it would still
likely overwhelm health care infrastructure, both in the United States and
across the world. Hospitals and doctors' offices would struggle to meet demand
from the number of patients requiring care. Such an event would require
significant increases in the manufacture, distribution and supply of
medications, products and life-saving medical equipment, such as mechanical
ventilators. Businesses and schools would struggle to function, and even basic
services like trash pickup and waste removal could be impacted.

The best defense against the flu continues to be a flu vaccine, but even
today, flu vaccines face a number of challenges. One challenge is that flu
vaccines are often moderately effective, even when well matched to circulating
viruses. But perhaps the biggest challenge is the time required to manufacture
a new vaccine against an emerging pandemic threat. Generally, it has taken
about 20 weeks to select and manufacture a new vaccine.

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the first doses of pandemic vaccine did not
become available until 26 weeks after the decision to manufacture a monovalent
vaccine.3 As a result, most vaccinations in the United States occurred after
the peak of 2009 H1N1 illness. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan has a goal of
reducing the timeframe to make a pandemic flu vaccine from 20 weeks to 12
weeks, but accomplishing this is challenging.

One possible solution is to create more broadly protective and longer lasting
vaccines. Creation of a "universal vaccine" continues to elude the world's top
scientists, but in the future, it could become a reality. In the meantime,
health officials seek to get the most out of new and existing flu vaccine
technologies, such as cell based and recombinant vaccines, which are not
reliant on a supply of chicken eggs, like traditional vaccines, and have the
potential to be produced faster.

One other vaccine issue is the inadequate global capacity for mass producing
flu vaccines. Global pandemic flu vaccine capacity was estimated to be 6.4
billion doses in 2015, but this is not enough to cover even half of the
world's population, should two doses of a pandemic vaccine be required for
protection.3

Other challenges at a global level include surveillance capacity,
infrastructure and pandemic planning. The majority of counties that report to
the WHO still do not have a national pandemic plan, and critical and clinical
care capacity, especially in low income countries, continues to be inadequate
to the demands of a severe pandemic.3 In 2005, milestones were created in the
revised International Health Regulations (IHR) for countries to improve their
response capacity for public health emergencies, but in 2016, only one-third
of countries were in compliance.3

All of these issues show that more work needs to be done, both here in the
United States and internationally, to prepare for the next pandemic. On May 7,
2018, The Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in partnership
with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hosted a one-day
symposium on the 100-year anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The
event involved experts from government and academia discussing current
pandemic threats and the future of pandemic preparedness, influenza prevention
and control. U.S. and global influenza experts who attended the meeting agreed
that we still face great challenges to prepare for future flu pandemics, but
part of the solution is recognizing these challenges and working together with
the rest of the world to address them.
