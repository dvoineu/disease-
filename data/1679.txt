Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is an acute febrile
illness of unknown cause that primarily affects children younger than 5 years
of age. The disease was first described in Japan by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967,
and the first cases outside of Japan were reported in Hawaii in 1976. Clinical
signs include fever, rash, swelling of the hands and feet, irritation and
redness of the whites of the eyes, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and
irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and throat.
