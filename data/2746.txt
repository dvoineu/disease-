Hypospadias is a birth (congenital) defect in which the opening of the urethra
is on the underside of the penis. The urethra is the tube that drains urine
from the bladder. In males, the opening of the urethra is normally at the end
of the penis.

## Causes

Hypospadias occurs in up to 4 in 1,000 newborn boys. The cause is often
unknown.

Sometimes, the condition is passed down through families.

## Symptoms

Symptoms depend on how severe the problem is.

Most often, boys with this condition have the opening of the urethra near the
tip of the penis on the underside.

More severe forms of hypospadias occur when the opening is in the middle or
base of the penis. Rarely, the opening is located in or behind the scrotum.

This condition may cause a downward curve of the penis during an erection.
Erections are common in infant boys.

Other symptoms include:

    * Abnormal spraying of urine
    * Having to sit down to urinate
    * Foreskin that makes the penis looks like it has a "hood" 

## Exams and Tests

This problem is almost always diagnosed soon after birth during a physical
exam. Imaging tests may be done to look for other congenital defects.

## Treatment

Infants with hypospadias should not be circumcised. The foreskin should be
kept intact for use in later surgical repair.

In most cases, surgery is done before the child starts school. Today, most
urologists recommend repair before the child is 18 months old. Surgery can be
done as young as 4 months old. During the surgery, the penis is straightened
and the opening is corrected using tissue grafts from the foreskin. The repair
may require several surgeries.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Results after surgery are most often good. In some cases, more surgery is
needed to correct fistulas, narrowing of the urethra, or a return of the
abnormal penis curve.

Most males can have normal adult sexual activity.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if your son has:

    * A curved penis during an erection
    * Opening to the urethra that is not on the tip of the penis
    * Incomplete (hooded) foreskin

## Patient Instructions

    * Hypospadias repair - discharge
