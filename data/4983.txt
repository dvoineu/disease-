## Abstract

**Problem/Condition:** Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has short- and long-term
adverse clinical outcomes, including death and disability. TBI can be caused
by a number of principal mechanisms, including motor-vehicle crashes, falls,
and assaults. This report describes the estimated incidence of TBI-related
emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths during 2013 and
makes comparisons to similar estimates from 2007.

**Reporting Period:** 2007 and 2013.

**Description of System:** State-based administrative health care data were
used to calculate estimates of TBI-related ED visits and hospitalizations by
principal mechanism of injury, age group, sex, and injury intent. Categories
of injury intent included unintentional (motor-vehicle crashes, falls, being
struck by or against an object, mechanism unspecified), intentional (self-harm
and assault/homicide), and undetermined intent. These health records come from
the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Emergency Department
Sample and National Sample. TBI-related death analyses used CDC multiple-
cause-of-death public-use data files, which contain death certificate data
from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

**Results:** In 2013, a total of approximately 2.8 million TBI-related ED
visits, hospitalizations, and deaths (TBI-EDHDs) occurred in the United
States. This consisted of approximately 2.5 million TBI-related ED visits,
approximately 282,000 TBI-related hospitalizations, and approximately 56,000
TBI-related deaths. TBIs were diagnosed in nearly 2.8 million (1.9%) of the
approximately 149 million total injury- and noninjury-related EDHDs that
occurred in the United States during 2013. Rates of TBI-EDHDs varied by age,
with the highest rates observed among persons aged ≥75 years (2,232.2 per
100,000 population), 0-4 years (1,591.5), and 15-24 years (1,080.7). Overall,
males had higher age-adjusted rates of TBI-EDHDs (959.0) compared with females
(810.8) and the most common principal mechanisms of injury for all age groups
included falls (413.2, age-adjusted), being struck by or against an object
(142.1, age-adjusted), and motor-vehicle crashes (121.7, age-adjusted). The
age-adjusted rate of ED visits was higher in 2013 (787.1) versus 2007 (534.4),
with fall-related TBIs among persons aged ≥75 years accounting for 17.9% of
the increase in the number of TBI-related ED visits. The number and rate of
TBI-related hospitalizations also increased among persons aged ≥75 years (from
356.9 in 2007 to 454.4 in 2013), primarily because of falls. Whereas motor-
vehicle crashes were the leading cause of TBI-related deaths in 2007 in both
number and rate, in 2013, intentional self-harm was the leading cause in
number and rate. The overall age-adjusted rate of TBI-related deaths for all
ages decreased from 17.9 in 2007 to 17.0 in 2013; however, age-adjusted TBI-
related death rates attributable to falls increased from 3.8 in 2007 to 4.5 in
2013, primarily among older adults. Although the age-adjusted rate of TBI-
related deaths attributable to motor-vehicle crashes decreased from 5.0 in
2007 to 3.4 in 2013, the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related ED visits
attributable to motor-vehicle crashes increased from 83.8 in 2007 to 99.5 in
2013. The age-adjusted rate of TBI-related hospitalizations attributable to
motor-vehicle crashes decreased from 23.5 in 2007 to 18.8 in 2013.

**Interpretation:** Progress has been made to prevent motor-vehicle crashes,
resulting in a decrease in the number of TBI-related hospitalizations and
deaths from 2007 to 2013. However, during the same time, the number and rate
of older adult fall-related TBIs have increased substantially. Although
considerable public interest has focused on sports-related concussion in
youth, the findings in this report suggest that TBIs attributable to older
adult falls, many of which result in hospitalization and death, should receive
public health attention.

**Public Health Actions:** The increase in the number of fall-related TBIs in
older adults suggests an urgent need to enhance fall-prevention efforts in
that population. Multiple effective interventions have been identified, and
CDC has developed the STEADI initiative (Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and
Injuries) as a comprehensive strategy that incorporates empirically supported
clinical guidelines and scientifically tested interventions to help primary
care providers address their patients' fall risk through the identification of
modifiable risk factors and implementation of effective interventions (e.g.,
exercise, medication management, and Vitamin D supplementation).

##  Introduction

CDC conducts surveillance of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to understand the
public health burden, to monitor trends, and to identify groups at greatest
risk for TBI. TBI is a major cause of mortality in the United States,
contributing to approximately 30% of all injury-related deaths ( _1_ ). The
burden on the health care system is also substantial; in 2010, approximately
2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, or deaths were
associated with TBI ( _2_ ). From 2001 to 2010, the rates of ED visits
increased by 70%, and rates of hospitalization and death increased by 11% and
7%, respectively ( _2_ ).

Historically, CDC's national estimates of TBI-related hospitalizations and ED
visits have been based on data from two sources: the National Hospital
Discharge Survey (NHDS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NHAMCS), respectively. These databases have been useful in identifying
broad groups affected by TBI and the most common principal mechanisms of
injury resulting in TBI. However, the relatively small sample sizes of these
databases have not allowed for the calculation of stable annual estimates by
subgroups of interest, such as estimates stratified by both age group and
principal mechanism of injury. As a result, pooled years of data were required
to achieve stability; for example, data published by CDC in 2010 included
estimates of TBI-related medical encounters from NHDS and NHAMCS that were
pooled for 2002-2006\. This limits the ability of researchers to document
changes in TBI incidence over time, especially for subgroups of particular
risk (e.g., falls among children and older adults and sports-related TBIs
among youth). To improve TBI estimation, CDC identified alternative databases
that were large enough to provide annual estimates of TBI within subgroups.
CDC uses the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases to
estimate the incidence of TBI in the United States ( _3_ - _5_ ). The findings
in this report can be used by public health officials to understand trends in
TBI-related medical events (e.g., emergency department visits,
hospitalizations and deaths) and to identify priority areas for prevention
programs.

##  Methods

To estimate the incidence of TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits,
hospitalizations, and deaths (TBI-EDHDs) during 2013 compared to 2007, CDC
analyzed the latest data from two HCUP databases and the National Vital
Statistics System (NVSS). The findings are reported by principal mechanism of
injury, age group, sex, and medical event type (i.e., ED visits,
hospitalizations, deaths) for 2013. In addition, estimates from 2007 and 2013
were compared to describe changes in TBI incidence since CDC's most recent
detailed report examining data during 2002-2006 ( _1_ ). Traumatic brain
injury-related deaths were analyzed using the multiple-cause-of-death files
from the 2007 and 2013 NVSS.

### Data Sources

The HCUP Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) and HCUP National
Inpatient Sample (NIS) are visit-based databases that contain sample sizes
large enough to provide stable annual estimates of TBI for subgroups ( _3_ ,
_4_ ). Previous work has found that the frequencies of TBI-related
hospitalizations and ED visits in these HCUP databases are comparable to those
observed in NHDS and NHAMCS ( _5_ ). NVSS includes data for all deaths
registered in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia ( _6_ ).

Data used to describe TBI-related ED visits were obtained from the 2007 and
2013 NEDS. NEDS is the largest all-payer ED record database in the United
States; in 2013, it contained 29,581,718 records representing 134,869,015 ED
visits nationally ( _4_ ). NEDS is designed to represent a 20% stratified
sample of U.S. hospital-based EDs with records drawn from non-Federal, short-
term, general, and other specialty hospitals from participating states (30
states in 2013) ( _4_ ).

TBI-related inpatient hospitalizations were analyzed using data from the 2007
and 2013 NIS. Similar to NEDS, NIS is the largest all-payer inpatient
hospitalization database; in 2013, it contained data from 7,119,563 records,
representing 35,597,792 hospital discharges nationally ( _3_ ). Throughout the
report, NIS discharges are referred to as hospitalizations. The 2013 data
represent a 20% sample of hospital discharges from community hospitals,
excluding rehabilitation and long-term acute care facilities ( _3_ ).

Records from both NEDS and NIS do not include individual patient identifiers
and, unlike the mortality data, might contain more than one record per person
(i.e., multiple ED visits for the same injury or multiple medical event types
for different injuries). Certain records were excluded to reduce the
possibility of counting multiple encounters for the same injury. In-hospital
deaths were excluded from the hospitalization counts (because these would be
included in the mortality data), as were hospital transfers and hospital
admissions that occurred directly from the ED (because each would be included
in the hospitalization data).

### Surveillance Definition

For TBI-related ED visits and hospitalizations, cases were identified using
codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) using an established definition ( _7_ ).
Records were included and classified as TBI-related if any of the following
ICD-9-CM codes were included in the record as a diagnosis code, regardless of
its position (i.e., both primary and secondary diagnoses were included):

### Variables

Data were stratified by age, sex, principal mechanism of injury, and injury
intent. Age groups included ages 0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64,
65-74, and ≥75 years. Principal mechanisms of injury included motor-vehicle
crashes, falls, being struck by or against an object, mechanism unspecified,
and other. Categories of injury intent included unintentional (motor-vehicle
crashes, falls, being struck by or against an object, mechanism unspecified),
intentional (self-harm and assault/homicide), and undetermined intent.
Estimates of intentional self-harm were suppressed for the 0-4 and 5-14 year
age groups because it is unclear whether children aged <10 years are truly
able to form suicidal intent ( _8_ ). For ED visits and hospitalizations,
these categories were based on CDC's recommended framework for grouping
external cause-of-injury codes (E-codes) using ICD-9-CM ( _9_ ). Up to four
E-codes can be recorded per ED visit or hospitalization in NEDS or NIS. The
first-listed E-code should correspond to the most serious diagnosis assigned (
_10_ ). Therefore, only the first-listed valid E-code was used in this
analysis, and this assigned code was assumed to be the principal mechanism of
injury for the TBI. Valid injury mechanism E-codes (E800-E966 and E968-E999)
are those that are correct in syntax (i.e., they exist as stated within
ICD-9-CM) and correspond to a principal mechanism of injury rather than an
activity (code E000), place of occurrence (E001-E030), or perpetrator of abuse
(E967). Principal mechanism of injury and injury intent for TBI-related deaths
were categorized on the basis of the CDC-recommended external cause of injury
mortality matrix for ICD-10 ( _11_ ).

### Statistical Analysis

For ED visits and hospitalizations, data were weighted to provide national
estimates of annual numbers and rates per 100,000 population. These rates and
95% confidence intervals around each rate were based on U.S. bridged-race
population estimates of the resident population released and maintained by CDC
for individual years ( _12_ ). Age-adjusted rates were standardized to the
U.S. census population estimates for 2000 by the direct method ( _1_ ).
Estimates were considered unreliable and not reported if the relative standard
error was >30% or the standard error = 0. Chi-square or t-tests were used to
analyze between-group differences for number and rates, respectively, of TBI-
related ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Only selected comparisons
were tested for statistical significance. Differences with p values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS Systems for Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina).

The sampling frame for NIS data changed in 2012. Before 2012, NIS data were
derived from a sample of hospitals with all discharges included. Beginning in
2012, NIS data were based on a sample of discharges from all NIS-participating
hospitals. Revised weights for trend analyses using 2011 NIS data and earlier
were used to calculate estimates comparable to the new design in accordance
with NIS guidance ( _13_ ).

##  Results

In 2013, a total of 2.8 million TBI-EDHDs occurred in the United States (Table
1). This consisted of approximately 2.5 million TBI-related ED visits,
approximately 282,000 TBI-related hospitalizations, and approximately 56,000
TBI-related deaths. Of the 149 million total injury and noninjury-related
EDHDs that occurred in the United States in 2013, TBIs were diagnosed in 1.9%
of these. The proportion of TBI-related injuries accounted for approximately
one of every 50 ED visits (2.2%). TBI-related deaths accounted for 2.2% of all
deaths in the United States.

### TBI-Related ED Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Age Group

Rates of TBI-EDHD varied by age, with the highest rates observed among those
aged ≥75 years (2,232.2 per 100,000 population), 0-4 years (1,591.5), and
15-24 years (1,080.7) (Table 2). With respect to TBI-related ED visits only,
the age groups with the highest rates were those aged ≥75 years (1,701.7), 0-4
years (1,541.1), and 15-24 years (1,001.9). Rates of TBI-related
hospitalizations and deaths were highest among the oldest age groups. For
hospitalizations, the age groups with the highest rates were those aged ≥75
years (454.4), 65-74 years (139.4), and 55-64 years (86.0). The same pattern
was observed for TBI-related deaths with the highest rates found among those
aged ≥75 years (76.1), 65-74 years (24.3), and 55-64 years (18.8). In terms of
overall numbers, persons aged 15-24 years accounted for 17.9% of all TBI-
related ED visits, more than any other age group. Those aged ≥75 years
comprised the largest proportion of both TBI-related hospitalizations (31.4%)
and deaths (26.5%).

### TBI-Related ED Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Age Group and
Principal Mechanism of Injury

Rates of TBI-EDHDs varied by principal mechanism of injury, and by age group
within principal mechanism of injury (Table 3). Overall, the most common
principal mechanisms of injury were falls (413.2 per 100,000 population, age-
adjusted), being struck by or against an object (142.1, age-adjusted), and
motor-vehicle crashes (121.7, age-adjusted). These principal mechanisms
represented 47.2%, 15.4%, and 13.7% of all TBI-EDHDs, respectively. Examining
each principal mechanism by age group reveals a different pattern. Those aged
≥75 years had the highest rate of fall-related TBI-EDHDs (1,859.0), followed
by 0-4 years (1,119.3), and 65-74 years (539.8). For TBI-EDHDs attributable to
being struck by or against an object, the age groups with the highest rate
include those aged 5-14 years (291.9), 0-4 years (262.7), and 15-24 years
(243.3). Finally, for TBI-EDHDs attributable to motor-vehicle crashes, those
aged 15-24 years (258.3), 25-34 years (182.9), and 35-44 years (126.5) had the
highest rates.

### TBI-Related ED Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Sex and Principal
Mechanism of Injury

Differences in age-adjusted rates were found for each principal mechanism when
comparing rates of TBI-EDHDs by sex (Table 4). Overall, males had higher age-
adjusted rates of TBI-EDHDs (959.0 per 100,000 population) compared with
females (810.8. Males had higher age-adjusted rates of being struck by or
against an object compared with females (167.3 versus 115.6), a higher age-
adjusted rate of motor-vehicle crash-related TBI-EDHDs (128.2 versus 115.5), a
more than fivefold higher age-adjusted rate of intentional self-harm-related
TBI-EDHDs (11.7 versus 2.3), a higher age-adjusted rate of assault-related
TBI-EDHDs (96.0 versus 54.8) (Table 4). Females had a significantly higher
age-adjusted rate of fall-related TBI-EDHDs compared to men (417.7 versus
400.7).

### Comparison of TBI-Related ED Visits Between 2007 and 2013 by Age Group and
Principal Mechanism of Injury

Age-adjusted rates of TBI-related ED visits increased from 534.4 per 100,000
in 2007 to 787.1 in 2013 (Table 2). Further, this increase in TBI-related ED
visit rates has occurred for nearly all of the major principal mechanism
categories: a 65% increase for falls (from 222.6 per 100,000 to 366.5, age-
adjusted); a 55% increase in being struck by or against an object (from 90.3
to 139.8, age-adjusted); a 75% increase for TBIs as a result of intentional
self-harm (from 0.4 to 0.7, age-adjusted); a 20% increase for assaults (from
56.8 to 68.2, age-adjusted); and a 19% increase for motor-vehicle crashes
(from 83.8 to 99.5, age-adjusted) (Table 5).

The number of TBI-related ED visits increased from approximately 1.6 million
in 2007 to approximately 2.5 million in 2013, representing an increase of more
than 50%, or an increase of more than 850,000 ED visits (Table 2). The key
contributors to the increase are falls (accounting for 57.3% of the increase);
being struck by or against an object (accounting for 18.2% of the increase);
and motor-vehicle crashes (accounting for 7.0% of the increase). With respect
to both principal mechanism and age, the key contributors to the increase are
fall-related TBIs among those aged ≥75 years (accounting for 17.9% of the
increase), aged 65-74 years (accounting for 7.7% of the increase), aged 55-64
years (accounting for 6.7% of the increase), and aged 0-4 years (accounting
for 6.1% of the increase) and being struck by or against an object among those
aged 5-14 years (accounting for 5.7% of the increase) and 15-24 years
(accounting for 4.2% of the increase).

### Comparison of TBI-Related Hospitalizations Between 2007 and 2013 by Age
Group and Principal Mechanism of Injury

Approximately 75% of TBI-related hospitalizations in 2013 were attributable to
two principal mechanisms: falls (50.4%) and motor-vehicle crashes (21.5%)
(Table 6). Overall, the total number of TBI-related hospitalizations in 2013
(281,555) was similar to the number of TBI-related hospitalizations in 2007
(267,350) and rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained nearly the same
(Table 2). The age-adjusted rate of TBI-related hospitalizations attributable
to motor-vehicle crashes decreased from 2007 to 2013 (from 23.5 to 18.8 per
100,000) (Table 6). In addition, the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related
hospitalizations attributable to falls increased from 33.9 in 2007 to 42.2 in
2013.

Age was an important factor contributing to the TBI-related hospitalization
rate change from 2007 to 2013. The overall decrease in rates of TBI-related
hospitalizations attributable to motor-vehicle crashes was evidenced most
prominently among those aged 15-24 years as the rate decreased from 47.3 in
2007 to 31.8 in 2013 (Table 6). The overall increase in rates of TBI-related
hospitalizations attributable to falls was observed most prominently among
those aged ≥75 years (from 257.3 in 2007 to 354.8 in 2013).

### Comparison of TBI-Related Deaths Between 2007 and 2013 by Age Group and
Principal Mechanism of Injury

Overall, the number of TBI-related deaths increased from 54,699 in 2007 to
55,920 in 2013 (Table 2). However, age-adjusted rates of TBI-related deaths
decreased slightly during that period (from 17.9 to 17.0 per 100,000). This
decrease is largely attributable to an overall decrease in the age-adjusted
rate of TBI-related deaths attributable to motor-vehicle crashes (5.0 in 2007
to 3.4 in 2013) (Table 7). Despite the overall decrease in rates, there were
increases in the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related deaths attributable to falls
(from 3.8 in 2007 to 4.5 in 2013) and intentional self-harm (from 4.8 in 2007
to 5.6 in 2013). Whereas motor-vehicle crashes were the leading cause of TBI-
related death in 2007, in both number and rate, intentional self-harm was the
leading cause, in number and rate, in 2013. Increases between 2007 and 2013 in
the number of TBI-related deaths attributable to self-harm were found among
all age groups examined (i.e., those aged ≥15 years). In 2013, of TBI-related
deaths attributable to self-harm, 86.9% were among males; in 96.9% of these
cases, a firearm was the principal mechanism (data not shown). Although
leading causes of TBI-related deaths for all other age groups are either
falls, motor-vehicle crashes, or unintentional self-harm, the leading cause
among those aged 0-4 years in 2007 and 2013 was assault/homicide (Table 7).

The overall decrease in the rate of TBI-related deaths attributable to motor-
vehicle crashes was found among all age groups, with the most pronounced
decrease being among those aged 15-24 years (from 10.0 in 2007 to 5.7 in
2013). The increased rate of TBI-related deaths attributable to falls was not
evenly spread among all ages as those aged ≥75 years had the largest increase
(from 39.7 in 2007 to 50.3 in 2013).

##  Discussion

In 2013, approximately 2.8 million TBI-EDHDs occurred in the United States.
Most were TBI-related ED visits (87.9%), and only 2.0% of the total were TBI-
related deaths. Males continue to have higher rates of TBI-EDHDs compared with
females ( _1_ , _14_ ). Although the total number of TBI-EDHDs has increased
over time, the increases are not uniform across all age groups or principal
mechanisms of injury, and this suggests priority areas for TBI-related
prevention.

Several hypotheses might explain the increase in TBI-EDHDs over time. First,
heightened public awareness about sports-related concussions might have
translated to greater public concern about the effects of TBI generally,
leading people of all ages to more readily seek care. Second, heightened
awareness among health care providers, and the broader dissemination of
validated assessment tools, might have resulted in more TBI diagnoses.
Although increases among youth were found for TBI-related ED visits, there
were significant increases in the number of ED visits, hospitalizations, and
deaths attributable to TBIs resulting from older adult falls. This across-the-
board increase over a relatively short time, suggests the need to address
preventing and reducing the number of older adult falls resulting in TBI.

The highest rates of TBI-EDHDs were among the oldest or youngest age groups.
TBIs in these age groups are notable for several reasons. In children aged <7
years, TBIs can impair neurologic development and the ability to meet
developmental milestones ( _15_ ). Impaired development might lead to further
challenges as a child ages, such as declines in academic functioning and
psychosocial sequelae such as emotional and behavioral disorders (e.g.,
depression or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) ( _16_ - _19_ ). In
older adults, TBIs are associated more often with hospitalization and death.
Cognitive and physical reserve are diminished at older ages, so TBIs might
have a greater impact on daily living. TBIs in older adults are more likely to
lead to hospitalization and these hospitalizations can be complicated by the
presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, more frequent use of anticoagulants
among older adults can result in a greater likelihood of secondary effects
because of an increased likelihood of intracranial hemorrhage ( _20_ , _21_ ).

The most common principal mechanisms of injury for TBI-EDHDs were falls, being
struck by or against an object, and motor-vehicle crashes. Although these
three principal mechanisms accounted for approximately 70% of all TBI-EDHDs,
particular age groups were disproportionally affected by specific principal
mechanisms, similar to previous studies ( _1_ , _14_ , _22_ , _23_ ).
Approximately half of all fall-related TBI-EDHDs occurred among those aged 0-4
years and ≥75 years. Codes defining whether a TBI was fall-related are
heterogeneous. In addition to falls attributable to tripping and slipping, the
codes also capture falls on stairs or from ladders, falls from one level to
another (e.g., from a bed or chair), and falls into openings such as swimming
pools. This analysis did not examine the individual contribution of each fall-
related code. Future analyses could examine these individual codes to
delineate better how activities leading to fall-related TBI vary by age group.

Certain prevention strategies have been identified for older adult falls, many
of which have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials to be
effective ( _24_ ). These include multicomponent physical exercise programs,
Tai chi, Vitamin D supplementation (which might be effective among those who
are Vitamin D deficient), surgical interventions (e.g., pacemakers and
cataract surgery where indicated), and strategies to reduce home hazards
(e.g., increased lighting and removal of tripping hazards). CDC has developed
the STEADI initiative (Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injuries) as a
comprehensive strategy to reduce falls in older adults. STEADI incorporates
empirically supported clinical guidelines and scientifically tested
interventions to help primary care providers address patient fall risk through
the identification of modifiable risk factors and implementation of effective
interventions (e.g., medication management) ( _25_ ).

A number of strategies have been suggested for preventing injuries in children
in general, including those resulting from falls. These include the use of
safety gates at the top and bottom of stairways; ensuring that children aged
<6 years do not sleep in the top bunk of a bunk bed; seat belt use in a
shopping cart; use of an appropriate helmet for activities such as bicycle
riding, skateboarding, and horseback riding; and age- and activity-appropriate
supervision by adult caregivers ( _26_ - _28_ ). To prevent TBIs related to
motor-vehicle crashes among infants and children, children should sit in the
back seat until aged 13 years and be seated in age- and size-appropriate car
seats ( _29_ ). Unrestrained children aged 4-15 years are three times more
likely to sustain a TBI than children who were restrained ( _30_ ). The
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infants and toddlers
remain in a rear-facing car safety seat until aged 2 years or until they reach
the height and weight limit designated by the manufacturer of the car seat,
then be restrained in forward-facing car seats (until they reach the
height/weight limits on their car seats) ( _29_ ). AAP recommends that
children sit in a booster seat once they outgrow child safety seats and can
fit appropriately into an adult seat belt ( _29_ ).

The leading cause of TBI-related death among those aged 0-4 years was
assault/homicide, including abusive head trauma by inflicted blunt impact or
violent shaking, and other causes, such as firearm-related injuries ( _31_ ).
A number of strategies have been developed to prevent child abuse and neglect.
To help communities make use of the best available evidence for prevention,
CDC has released a technical package that describes a set of strategies and
examples of specific approaches that enhance safe, stable, nurturing
relationships and environments for children and families to reduce abuse and
neglect and promote health ( _32_ ).

The highest rates of TBI-EDHDs occurring after being struck by or against
objects were among those aged 0-24 years. Sports- and recreation-related
activities likely contribute to these types of injuries, especially for those
aged 4-24 years. However, this analysis did not look at specific E-codes as a
means to identify sports- and recreation-related TBIs. Although E-codes have
been used to identify sports-related injuries ( _33_ ), it is challenging to
describe all activities associated with sports and recreation using these data
due to differences in coding policies among health care providers, limited
documentation in medical records, and limited utility of E-codes. To obtain
greater detail about the nature of "struck by or against" related injuries and
identify targets for prevention, use of other data sources would be needed.
For example, the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury
Program (NEISS-AIP) includes narratives with each record that provide a short
description of the injury event. Sometimes this includes what the person was
doing at the time of injury and additional parties involved. Such information
has been more useful in identifying risk factors for strike-related TBI
incidence ( _22_ ).

The most common principal mechanism of TBI-EDHDs among persons aged 15-24 and
25-34 years was motor-vehicle crashes. This corresponds with the age groups
that are known to be at higher risk for a motor-vehicle crash ( _34_ ).
Several factors have contributed to increased motor vehicle-related injuries
in teens and young adult drivers compared to older drivers, including a
reduced ability to recognize driving hazards and unsafe road conditions ( _35_
), low frequency of seat belt use ( _36_ ), and higher levels of alcohol-
impaired driving ( _37_ ). The motor vehicle mechanism category used in the
analysis includes injuries to pedal cyclists and pedestrians by motor
vehicles. However, previous research has shown that approximately 70% of the
motor-vehicle-related TBIs in persons aged 15-34 years involve occupants of a
vehicle, approximately 12% involve motorcycle passengers, and approximately 8%
involve pedestrians ( _1_ ).

Compared to 2007, in 2013 the overall age-adjusted rate of TBI-related
hospitalizations attributable to motor-vehicle crashes decreased, with the
largest decreases occurring among those aged 15-24 years. This may be due to
the implementation of programs and policies focused on young and inexperienced
drivers. Programs such as graduated drivers licensing focus on young drivers
as a way to increase safety awareness and reduce driving under high-risk
driving conditions when the driver is still relatively inexperienced ( _38_ ).
All states have instituted zero tolerance for alcohol and driving among young
drivers (i.e., those aged <20 years) ( _39_ ). Overall decreases in these
motor-vehicle-related hospitalizations were likely the result of both
behavioral and vehicle improvements such as the increased use of seatbelts and
vehicle safety measures such as airbags and electronic stability control (
_40_ - _42_ ). These advances have helped to reduce the incidence of motor-
vehicle crashes but might also contribute to decreased injury severity,
resulting in fewer TBIs that require hospitalization.

Although the number of TBI-related deaths increased from 2007 to 2013, the
age-adjusted rate of TBI-related deaths decreased. This decrease was largely
attributable to a decrease in the rate of fatal TBIs in motor-vehicle crashes.
However, to some extent, this decrease has masked increases during the same
period in fatal TBIs caused by falls, particularly among older adults, and an
increase in fatal TBIs attributable to intentional self-harm. Fatal TBIs
attributable to intentional self-harm were found predominantly among males;
firearms were the predominant principal mechanism of injury. The increase in
fatal TBIs attributable to intentional self-harm is consistent with an overall
increase in suicide rates in the United States and underscores the importance
of comprehensive and coordinated prevention efforts, including efforts to
enhance social support and connectedness, reduce stigma for help-seeking, and
provide support for those at greatest risk ( _43_ _,_ _44_ ).

The increase in the overall number of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths
attributable to older adult falls might be in some part attributable to
increased life expectancy combined with the increased risk of falls among
older adults ( _45_ ). However, the increase in life expectancy during the
relatively short period of time covered by this analysis (from 78.1 years in
2007 to 78.8 in 2013) cannot explain such a large increase in the rate of TBI-
related hospitalizations and deaths attributable to falls among older adult
age groups. The reason or reasons for this increase are unknown.

##  Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First,
these findings might overestimate the incidence of TBI-related ED visits and
hospitalizations because the data are collected at the visit-level only.
Thereby multiple records might exist for a single injury as persons might
present more than once for treatment. However, steps were taken to reduce the
number of records that were double-counted, including removing in-hospital
deaths (that would be included in the mortality data) and excluding hospital
transfers but residual double counting for multiple encounters/readmissions
cannot be ruled out. Second, clinical severity cannot be ascertained from
hospital administrative data that are not primarily designed for public health
surveillance. Although TBIs are included as a diagnosis in the HCUP NIS and
NEDS records, the severity of these injuries is unknown, nor is it known if
hospital admissions with multiple diagnoses were attributable to the head
injury or to another diagnosis. Third, this study does not include data on
persons who did not seek care for their TBI or those who sought care in an
outpatient setting. As a result, the TBI-EDHDs described in this report are
not a complete accounting of all TBIs occurring in the United States and
likely an undercount of TBIs that are milder in severity.

##  Conclusion

In 2013, approximately 2.8 million TBI-related ED visits, hospitalizations,
and deaths occurred in the United States, representing an increase since 2007
that was largely attributed to an increase in the number and rate of TBI-
related ED visits. Although much public interest has been devoted to sports-
related concussion in youth, the findings in this report indicate that older
adult falls account for a much larger proportion of the increase in TBI-
related ED visits during this period. In addition, although the modest
increases in ED visits that might be attributed to youth sports concussion do
not extend to increases in TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths, the same
cannot be said for TBIs attributable to older adult falls. From 2007 to 2013,
increases in TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths attributable to older
adult falls suggest the need for greater attention to preventing older adult
falls. Empirically validated prevention measures can help reduce the incidence
of older adult falls.

The decrease in TBI-related deaths caused by motor-vehicle crashes from 2007
to 2013 is likely attributable to efforts to prevent motor-vehicle crashes.
Nevertheless, more can be done to further reduce motor-vehicle crashes. The
United States lags behind other high-income countries in the rate of motor-
vehicle crash deaths; in 2013, the rate of motor-vehicle crash deaths in the
United States was more than double the average rate of other high-income
comparison countries ( _46_ ). Redoubling efforts to increase restraint use
and reduce alcohol-impaired driving, among other proven interventions, are
critical to the continued reduction of motor-vehicle crashes and motor-vehicle
crash-related TBIs.
