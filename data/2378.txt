An abdominal tap is used to remove fluid from the area between the belly wall
and the spine. This space is called the abdominal cavity.

## How the Test is Performed

This test may be done in a health care provider's office, treatment room, or
hospital.

The puncture site will be cleaned and shaved, if necessary. You then receive a
local numbing medicine. The tap needle is inserted 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm)
into the abdomen. Sometimes, a small cut is made to help insert the needle.
The fluid is pulled out into a syringe.

The needle is removed. A dressing is placed on the puncture site. If a cut was
made, one or two stitches may be used to close it.

Sometimes, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. An ultrasound uses sound
waves to make the image and not x-rays. It does not hurt.

There are 2 kinds of abdominal taps:

    * Diagnostic tap --Â A small amount of fluid is taken and sent to the laboratory for testing.
    * Large volume tap --Â Several liters may be removed to relieve abdominal pain and fluid buildup. 

## How to Prepare for the Test

Let your provider know if you:

    * Have any allergies to medicines or numbing medicine
    * Are taking any medicines (including herbal remedies)
    * Have any bleeding problems
    * Might be pregnant 

## How the Test will Feel

You may feel a slight sting from the numbing medicine, or pressure as the
needle is inserted.

If a large amount of fluid is taken out, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded.
Tell the provider if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.

## Why the Test is Performed

Normally, the abdominal cavity contains only a small amount of fluid. In
certain conditions, large amounts of fluid can build up in this space.

An abdominal tap can help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup or the presence
of an infection. It may also be done to remove a large amount of fluid to
reduce belly pain.

## Normal Results

Normally, there should be little or no fluid in the abdominal space.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

An exam of abdominal fluid may show:

    * Cancer that has spread to the abdominal cavity (most often cancer of the ovaries)
    * Cirrhosis of the liver
    * Damaged bowel
    * Heart disease
    * Infection
    * Kidney disease
    * Pancreatic disease 

## Risks

There is a slight chance that the needle could puncture the bowel, bladder, or
a blood vessel in the abdomen. If a large quantity of fluid is removed, there
is a slight risk of lowered blood pressure and kidney problems. There is also
a slight chance of infection.

## Alternative Names

Peritoneal tap; Paracentesis; Ascites - abdominal tap; Cirrhosis - abdominal
tap; Malignant ascites - abdominal tap
