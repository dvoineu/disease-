## Summary

Salmonella is the name of a group of bacteria. In the United States, it is a
common cause of foodborne illness. Salmonella occurs in raw poultry, eggs,
beef, and sometimes on unwashed fruit and vegetables. You also can get
infected after handling pets, especially reptiles like snakes, turtles, and
lizards.

Symptoms include

    * Fever
    * Diarrhea
    * Abdominal cramps
    * Headache
    * Possible nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite

Symptoms usually last 4-7 days. Your health care provider diagnoses the
infection with a stool test. Most people get better without treatment.
Infection can be more serious in older adults, infants, and people with
chronic health problems. If Salmonella gets into the bloodstream, it can be
serious. The usual treatment is antibiotics.

Typhoid fever, a more serious disease caused by Salmonella, is not common in
the United States. It frequently occurs in developing countries.
