## Basal Body Temperature

Basal body temperature is your temperature at rest when you wake up in the
morning. This temperature rises slightly around the time of ovulation. Keeping
track of this temperature and other changes such as cervical mucus may help
you figure out when you are ovulating. Take your temperature before you get
out of bed every morning. Since the change during ovulation is only about 1/2
degree F (1/3 degree C), you should use a sensitive thermometer such as a
basal body thermometer.

## Blood Alcohol Content

Blood alcohol content, or blood alcohol concentration (BAC), is the amount of
alcohol in a given volume of blood. For medical and legal purposes, BAC is
expressed as grams of alcohol in a 100 milliliter sample of blood.

## Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries
as your heart pumps blood. It includes two measurements. "Systolic" is your
blood pressure when your heart beats while pumping blood. "Diastolic" is your
blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. You usually see blood
pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the
diastolic number. For example, you might see 120/80.

## Blood Type

There are four major blood types: A, B, O, and AB. The types are based on
substances on the surface of the blood cells. Besides blood types, there is
the Rh factor. It is a protein on red blood cells. Most people are Rh-
positive; they have Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Rh factor is
inherited though genes.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat. It is calculated from
your height and weight. It can tell you whether you are underweight, normal,
overweight, or obese. It can help you gauge your risk for diseases that can
occur with more body fat.

## Cervical Mucus

Cervical mucus comes from the cervix. It collects in the vagina. Tracking the
changes in your mucus during your cycle, along with changes in your basal body
temperature, may help you figure out when you are ovulating.

## Menstruation

Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as part of a
woman's monthly cycle. Keeping track of your cycles helps you figure out when
the next one will come, whether you missed one, and if there is a problem with
your cycles.

## Ovulation Test

Ovulation is the release of an egg from a woman's ovary. Ovulation tests
detect a rise in a hormone level that happens just before ovulation. This can
help you figure out when you will ovulate, and when you are most likely to get
pregnant.
