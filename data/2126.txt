## Summary

The spread of a disease doesn't stop at a country's borders. With more people
traveling to other countries and living in crowded cities, it's easier for
germs to spread. Infectious diseases that start in one part of the world can
quickly reach another. Resistance to medicines such as antbiotics is on the
rise. This makes it harder to treat certain diseases. Natural and man-made
disasters create refugee populations with immediate and long-term health
problems.

Some of the major diseases currently affecting countries around the globe
include HIV/AIDS, malaria, Zika, and tuberculosis. Climate change is also an
international problem which can affect people's health. Many countries and
health organizations are working together and sharing information on these and
other health issues.
