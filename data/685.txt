#  Legionnaires' Disease

Also called: Legionellosis

## Summary

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria. You usually
get it by breathing in mist from water that contains the bacteria. The mist
may come from hot tubs, showers, or air-conditioning units for large
buildings. The bacteria don't spread from person to person.

Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include high fever, chills, a cough, and
sometimes muscle aches and headaches. Other types of pneumonia have similar
symptoms. You will probably need a chest x-ray to diagnose the pneumonia. Lab
tests can detect the specific bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease.

Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to
get sick if you

    * Are older than 50
    * Smoke
    * Have a chronic lung disease
    * Have a weak immune system

Legionnaires' disease is serious and can be life-threatening. However, most
people recover with antibiotic treatment.
