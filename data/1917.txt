## Summary

Acne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair
follicles under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face, neck, back,
chest, and shoulders. Anyone can get acne, but it is common in teenagers and
young adults. It is not serious, but it can cause scars.

No one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes, such as those during
the teenage years and pregnancy, probably play a role. There are many myths
about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed, but there
is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. Another
common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however, blackheads and pimples
are not caused by dirt. Stress doesn't cause acne, but stress can make it
worse.

If you have acne

    * Clean your skin gently 
    * Try not to touch your skin 
    * Avoid the sun 

Treatments for acne include medicines and creams.
