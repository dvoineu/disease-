Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death
in the United States. Based on 2018 data, about 34 million US adults smoke
cigarettes. Every day, about 1,600 young people under age 18 years smoke their
first cigarette, and nearly 200 begin smoking cigarettes daily. Over 16
million people live with at least one disease caused by smoking, and 58
million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is at the forefront of
the nation's efforts to reduce deaths and prevent chronic diseases that result
from tobacco use. The agency and its partners promote tobacco control
interventions, including actions to prevent youth from starting to use
tobacco, smoke-free environments, programs to help tobacco users quit, and
steps to eliminate tobacco-related health disparities in different population
groups.
