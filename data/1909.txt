#  Ataxia Telangiectasia

## Summary

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, inherited disease. It affects the
nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. Symptoms appear in
young children, usually before age 5. They include

    * Ataxia - trouble coordinating movements
    * Poor balance 
    * Slurred speech
    * Tiny, red spider veins, called telangiectasias, on the skin and eyes
    * Lung infections
    * Delayed physical and sexual development

People with A-T have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers,
especially lymphoma and leukemia. Although it affects the brain, people with
A-T usually have normal or high intelligence.

A-T has no cure. Treatments might improve some symptoms. They include
injections to strengthen the immune system, physical and speech therapy, and
high-dose vitamins.
