Overview of PCR technologiesIn developing countries, the most commonly used approaches for detection and characterization of bacterial meningitis pathogens include culture, Gram stain, and latex agglutination. Although culture is considered the gold standard for case confirmation in clinics, the positive rate is relatively low due to suboptimal storage and transportation conditions, culture practice, and/or antibiotic treatment administered before the specimen is collected. While Gram staining is important, inexpensive, and should be performed whenever possible, it merely gives a clue as to the genus and species of the etiological agent. The reading of latex agglutination results is subjective and can be difficult to interpret, especially when a specimen's bacterial load is low. It is also not feasible to do quality control on latex agglutination. Culture should be kept as the gold standard as cultured bacteria are sources of data for antibiotic susceptibility, complete subtyping, the expression of antigens that are to be included in future vaccines, and pathophysiology of isolates. Specimens that do not yield any culture can still be analyzed by molecular methods (see below) that can be applied on DNA extracted from clinical specimens (typically, blood and CSF).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)PCR was developed in the mid- to late 1980s (36, 42) and is considered one of the most important methodological inventions in molecular biology. It is designed to permit selective amplification of a specific target DNA sequence(s) within a heterogeneous collection of DNA sequences (e.g., total genomic DNA). In PCR, the DNA target is exponentially amplified through repeating three major steps: 1) denaturation of double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNA; 2) annealing of primers to the complementary single-stranded target sequences; and 3) extension of the primers in the 5′ to 3′ direction by heat-stable DNA polymerase to produce double-stranded DNA molecules. The copy number of DNA molecules is doubled in each extension step, generating millions of copies of the original DNA molecules when PCR is completed. Because the method does not require live or intact cells, PCR is a valuable tool for detecting bacterial pathogenic agents from clinical specimens, where bacteria die or lyse easily due to inappropriate storage conditions or prior antibiotic treatment. PCR is now widely used in the diagnosis and surveillance of bacterial pathogens because of its high sensitivity and specificity and high throughput capabilities. It provides a complementary tool to classic phenotype-based methods such as culture, Gram stain, and latex agglutination and often enhances confirmatory results (3).A number of conventional PCR assays have been developed for detection and subtyping of bacterial and viral pathogens. Conventional PCR detects products at the end point of DNA amplification by visualizing amplicons using agarose gel electrophoresis. Gel-based detection requires that tubes containing PCR amplicons be opened and manipulated, thereby greatly increasing the risk of contamination of laboratory space, equipment, and reagents with amplified materials. Conventional PCR is also very time consuming and less sensitive and specific than a type of PCR called real-time PCR, so it is primarily used for typing assays employing purified cultures or clinical specimens that contain the organism in high density. The use of real-time PCR is rapidly expanding because it is easier to perform and, being a closed system, it reduces potential contamination problems inherent to conventional PCR. Many of the same precautions mentioned for conventional PCR assays also apply to real-time PCR assays.

Real-time PCR technologyReal-time PCR is also known as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR/qPCR) or kinetic polymerase chain reaction, which combines amplification and detection in one step through the use of fluorescent dyes. There are two types of detection systems: non-specific and specific. Non-specific detection systems use a fluorescent dye that intercalates into any double-stranded DNA molecules and emits enhanced fluorescence. This detection system is relatively inexpensive but susceptible to false positivity. Specific detection systems rely on fluorescent resonance energy transfer probes that specifically recognize target sequences, thus making them the systems of choice for the molecular detection assays described here. Specific detection systems are more expensive than non-specific detection systems and require sophisticated probe designs. Three types of probes are currently in use, including: hydrolysis, hybridization, and hairpin probes (7, 13). A fluorescent signal is only generated if the probe interacts with its specific target and is subsequently hydrolyzed during amplification. The resulting increase in fluorescence is proportional to the amount of amplified PCR product in the reaction.The first use of dual-labeled hydrolysis probes was reported in 1993 (30) and has been widely used in many laboratories since that time. A dual-labeled hydrolysis probe is an oligonucleotide (~17-35 bp long) labeled with a reporter fluorophore (usually a short wavelength colored dye) at the 5′ end and a quencher fluorophore (usually a long wavelength colored dye) at the 3′ end or at an internal thymine or "T" residue. Optimally, the quencher dye should be 7­-15 base pairs from the reporter dye. When the probe is intact and excited by a light source, the fluorescence emission of the reporter (or donor) dye is absorbed by the quencher (or acceptor) dye as a result of the close proximity of the dyes. This process is also known as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). During PCR amplification, the probe anneals to an internal region of the target DNA template between the forward and reverse primer. When DNA polymerase catalyzes the extension of the primer and reaches the region where the probe is bound, the 5′ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase cleaves the probe and releases the reporter from the quencher. This allows emission of the fluorescence from the reporter dye to be observed because it is no longer absorbed by the quencher which has diffused away (Figure 1). The increase in fluorescence is proportional to the amount of amplified PCR product in the reaction and is measured cumulatively over the course of the entire PCR run (7, 30).

Target gene assays for detection and characterization of bacterial meningitis etiologiesOver the past several years, conventional and real-time PCR assays have been developed for detection of bacterial meningitis pathogens. Reliable assays have been extensively evaluated using invasive clinical isolates and/or clinical specimens from around the world (8, 12, 15, 17, 29, 35, 52, 60). In general, validated assays should have high sensitivity and specificity. They can be used as complementary approaches in bacterial disease diagnosis. The gene targets, DNA sequence of primers and probes, and the final concentration used in the PCR reactions described here to detect and characterize _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ are listed in Tables 2-5.The PCR strategy typically employed to detect the causative agent in a suspected case of bacterial meningitis is to first run each of the species-specific assays concurrently on the DNA extracted from the clinical specimen or isolate. The appropriate serogroup/serotype specific assays should then be run on any positive specimens. See Section V below, "Workflow for detection of bacterial meningitis pathogens by PCR", for more details. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Species-specific real-time PCR assaysPCR detection of _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae,_ and _S. pneumoniae_ can be achieved by amplification of several potential gene targets (8, 35, 53, 60). The following assays have been developed and validated to be used on DNA extracted from clinical specimens (typically, blood and CSF) and bacterial isolates.  

##### _N. meningitidis_

Two genes can be targeted in _N. meningitidis_ species-specific assays, _ctrA_
and _sodC_. The capsule transport to cell surface gene, _ctrA,_ is highly
conserved among isolates responsible for invasive meningococcal infections and
has been used in both real-time and conventional PCR to detect _N.
meningitidis_ (35). It is a gene within the capsule locus (Figure 2). However,
since at least 16% of carried meningococci lack _ctrA_ (10, 14, 41), a real-
time PCR assay to detect all meningococci, regardless of encapsulation status,
was recently developed and validated (15). This assay targets the Cu, Zn
superoxide dismutase gene, _sodC_ , which is not genetically linked to the
capsule locus. The _sodC_ assay detects encapsulated meningococci, but it is
also useful for detecting nongroupable meningococci that do not contain an
intact _ctrA_ , as will be recovered during carriage studies. For this reason,
it is recommended that _sodC_ be used for detection of _N. meningitidis_ , if
possible. _sodC_ and _ctrA_ primers and probes are listed in Table 2.

##### _H. influenzae_

The protein D encoding gene, _hpd_ , encodes protein D, a highly conserved,
surface-exposed lipoprotein that is present in all encapsulated and non-
encapsulated _H. influenzae_ (24, 45). The conserved nature of this gene and
its presence in all strains of _H. influenzae_ characterized to date make it a
highly attractive gene target for the development of a _H. influenzae_
species-specific real-time PCR assay. The recently developed and validated
_hpd_ real-time PCR assay is capable of detecting all six serotypes (a-f) and
nontypeable (HiNT) _H. influenzae_ with high sensitivity and specificity (60).
Real-time PCR assays targeting _bexA_ were developed and distributed because
_bexA_ is present in all six serotypes of _H. influenzae_. However, though
sensitive for detection of Hib, it is less sensitive for Hia, Hic, and Hid,
and does not detect Hie, Hif, or HiNT and should no longer be used. The
primers and probes for the _hpd_ assay are listed in Table 2.

##### _S. pneumoniae_

Both conventional and real-time PCR assays have been developed for the
detection of _S. pneumoniae,_ and target genes have included the pneumolysin (
_ply_ ), autolysin ( _lytA_ ), and pneumococcal surface adhesion ( _psaA_ )
genes (8). However, false-positive results with _ply_ -based PCR have been
reported when applied to upper respiratory tract specimens. A suggested
explanation for these false positives is the detection of non-pneumococcal
alpha-hemolytic streptococci (37, 47), which are normally present in the
respiratory flora (e.g., _Streptococcus mitis_ group and _Streptococcus
oralis_ ) which sometimes contain a _ply_ gene (62). The PCR detection assay
for _S. pneumoniae_ using a specific segment of the autolysin gene ( _lyt_ A)
is recommended because it is highly conserved within the species and it has
been shown that this assay bestseparates _S. pneumoniae_ from the
genotypically similar species _S. mitis, S. oralis,_ and _S. pseudopneumoniae_
(33). The real-time PCR assay _lytA_ primers and probes that have been found
to be extremely reliable for detection of _S. pneumoniae_ are listed in Table
2. Due to recombination events that occur between pneumococci and closely
related streptococci, there will probably be rare false-positives or false-
negatives for virtually any real-time assay for pneumococcal identification.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Serogroup/serotype-specific real-time PCR assaysThe capsule gene loci of both _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ have areas that are both unique and conserved within each serogroup ( _N. meningitidis_ ) or serotype ( _H. influenzae_ ) thus providing gene targets for the development or real-time PCR assays designed to identify each specific serogroup or serotype.  

##### _N. meningitidis_

_N. meningitidis_ is classified into 12 serogroups on the basis of the
chemical composition and linkage type of saccharide subunits of the capsular
polysaccharide that are expressed on the bacterial cell surface. Major
disease-causing serogroups include A, B, C, Y, and W135, the latter four of
which produce sialic acid containing capsular polysaccharides; whereas
serogroup A produces a poly-α1-6-linked N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate
capsule (31). Outbreaks caused by serogroup X meningococci, which express
poly-α1-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate capsule (6) have also been
reported (2, 20). Serogroup D is no longer recognized as a serogroup of _N.
meningitidis_.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the genetic organization of the capsule locus is
conserved among the serogroups. The capsule expression genes are located in
four operons: one that encodes capsule biosynthesis (called _syn_ or _sia_
genes, depending on which nomenclature system is used) and three that encode
the capsule transport to the cell surface proteins ( _ctr_ ). The gene
products of the _ctr_ operon share high similarity with the ATP-dependent
transporters of the ABC family (19) and are highly conserved among the major
disease-causing serogroups (1, 18, 39, 55) and serogroup X (56). Sensitive
real-time PCR assays targeting _ctrA_ , which is the first gene in the capsule
transport operon, have been developed for detection of all encapsulated and
some non-encapsulated (nongroupable) _N. meningitidis_ (12, 35), though a more
specific and sensitive assay using the _sodC_ gene as a target has been
developed. The genetic differences among the capsule biosynthesis operons of
meningococcal serogroups have facilitated the development of real-time PCR
assays targeting serogroup-specific genes for capsule biosynthesis to
determine the capsule genotype of a meningococcal isolate (35).

The gene _sia_ (for sialic acid biosynthesis (16, 22), also called _syn_
forcapsule biosynthesis (21, 51), are used for genotyping for serogroups B (
_synD_ ), C ( _synE_ ), Y ( _synF_ ) and W135 ( _synG_ ). The _sacB_ gene is
targeted for serogroup A and the _xcbA_ gene, which most likely encodes the
capsule polymerase, is targeted for serogroup X (2, 35). These target genes
are depicted within the structure of the capsule gene complex for serogroups
A, B, C, Y, W135, and X (Figure 2). The most current adapted primer and probe
sequences for the serogrouping real-time PCR assays are listed in Table 3,
though, periodically, the primers and probes are adapted as new information
regarding probe chemistries and allelic variations become available.

There have been several different systems in place for naming the genes for
meningococcal capsule biosynthesis. Some groups have called this operon _syn_
for capsule bio _syn_ thesis (21, 51); other groups have used the _sia_
nomenclature for _sia_ lic acid biosynthesis (16, 22); still others have
referred to them as _neu_ genes based on homologies to _E. coli_ K1 genes for
_N_ -acetyl _neu_ raminic acidbiosynthesis (21). While the _siaD_ genes of
serogroups B, C, W135, and Y were initially thought to be alleles, more
extensive sequencing analysis demonstrated that this is not so. The _synD_ and
_synE_ genes of serogroups B and C, respectively, are alleles and encode
capsular polysaccharide polymerases that catalyze different linkages of sialic
acid monomers (α2->8 linkage for serogroup B and α2->9 linkage for serogroup
C). However, the Y and W135 genes are over twice the size of the B and C genes
and differ in nucleotide sequence (11, 50), though they are highly similar to
each other. In addition, the polymerases for serogroups Y and W135 link
heteropolymers of sialic acid plus either glucose or galactose, respectively.
Thus, the capsular polysaccharide polymerase genes of serogroups Y and W135
are alleles. To continue to call all of these polymerase genes _siaD_ would be
a misnomer. For these reasons and for simplicity, this text will use the
_synABCD_ / _E_ / _F_ / _G_ nomenclature listed above and in Table I.

For serogroups B, C, Y and W135, the first three genes of the _syn_ operon
encode functions for the synthesis of capsule polysaccharide precursors (32,
48, 51). The fourth gene product is a polymerase that catalyzes the formation
of polymers with the serogroup-specific linkage. In serogroups B and C, the
products of a four-gene operon ( _synABC_ plus the polysialyltransferase gene
_synD_ [Nmen B] or _synE_ [Nmen C]) are responsible for biosynthesis of the
sialic acid (also known as _N_ -acetylneuraminic acid, NeuNAc, or NANA)
homopolymer. Expression of the poly- _N_ -acetylmamosamine-1-phosphate capsule
polymer of serogroup A requires the _sacABCD_ operon (formerly known as
_mynABCD_ (49), while expression of the poly- _N_ -acetyl-D-
glucosamine-1-phosphate capsule of serogroup X requires the _xcbABC_ operon.

##### _Haemophilus influenzae_

The capsule locus of all six serotypes of _H. influenzae_ (Hi a, b, c, d, e,
and f) consists of three regions encoding functions for capsule polysaccharide
synthesis, modification, and translocation (Figures 3 and 4) (25, 43, 44).
_bexDCBA_ in the ATP-driven export region (also known as Region I) code for
protein components of an ATP-driven polysaccharide export apparatus. _hcsA_
and _hcsB_ in post polymerization modification region (also known as Region
III) share high similarity with _lipA_ and _lipB_ (recently renamed _ctrE_ and
_ctrF_ ), respectively, which are involved in modification and export of
meningococcal capsule polysaccharide (43). Both regions are common to all
serotypes. The same nomenclature is used for genes in the two regions for all
six serotypes. The serotype-specific region (previously Region II) contains
genes for capsule synthesis and is unique to each serotype. The serotype-
specific genes are named _acs_ , _bcs_ , etc. for "a capsule synthesis", "b
capsule synthesis", and so on.

The _cap_ locus encodes functions for _H. influenzae_ capsule synthesis. The
genetic organization of the _cap_ locus has been well characterized in Hib and
Hif, which belong to two phylogenetic divisions that are defined by multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis typing. The ATP-driven export region includes most of
Hia and Hib strains, and all of Hic, Hid, and Hie strains. Strains from this
region have at least one completed _cap_ locus flanked by insertion sequence
(IS) element IS _1016_ , except Hie. The majority of Hib strains and some Hia
strains from this region have the direct-repeat configuration with the second
copy of the _bexA_ gene partially deleted as illustrated in Figure 4. The
truncated _cap_ locus is not required for capsule synthesis (26-28). In Hif,
Hib, and Hia strains of the serotype-specific region and some Hie strains of
the ATP-driven export region, the _cap_ locus is flanked by _sodC_ and HI1637
(26, 44).

While serotype b causes the vast majority of _H. influenzae_ disease in
countries without a Hib vaccination program, serotypes a, c, d, e, and f, and
nontypeable _H. influenzae_ (NTHi), also contribute to case numbers (43, 59).
As implementation of Hib vaccine becomes more widespread, it is important to
monitor incoming specimens for both b and non-b serotypes of _H. influenzae_.
Therefore, serotype-specific real-time PCR assays have been developed that
target the serotype-specific region genes where possible, or the 5′ end of
_bexD_ , which is less conserved among the serotypes compared with the other
genes in the export region. The genes targeted for real-time PCR assays
specific to each serotype are as follows: _acsB_ (Hia), _bcsB_ (Hib), _ccsD_
(Hic), _dcsE_ (Hid), _ecsH_ (Hie), and _bexD_ (Hif) (Figure 3). The primer and
probe information for each of these serotyping assays can be found in Table 4.
Each of these assays has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for
their respective serotypes.

for a capsule synthesis, b capsule synthesis, and so on. With the exception of
the Hif serotype-specific assay, the target genes for the serotype-specific
assays can be found in this region.](/meningitis/lab-

The high cost of antisera, subjectivity in interpretation, need for a complete set of control strains, and technical expertise requirements associated with these serologic methods have resulted in the more recent development of PCR-based serotyping systems. PCR-serotyping has the potential to overcome some of the difficulties associated with serologic testing and the development of PCR-based assays for direct detection of serotypes from clinical specimens is a valuable aid in surveillance, particularly in situations where culture is insensitive. PCR assays (both conventional and real-time) for the detection of the more common serotypes are being developed and are discussed in more detail below (38, 54).  

##### Multiplex conventional PCR assays for serotyping _S. pneumoniae_

A multiplex PCR-based serotyping scheme that includes 40 serotype
specificities has been developed (38). This PCR approach has the potential to
greatly reduce reliance upon conventional serotyping and provides serotype-
determining potential to laboratories that lack type-specific antisera and
other reagents needed for conventional serotyping, yet have the equipment
necessary for DNA amplification and electrophoresis.

The multiplex approach uses 9 reactions to identify 40 serospecificities
(Table 5 for primers, Tables 6-8 for schemes, and Figure 5 for PCR products)
but also provides some flexibility that allows for altering combinations of
serotypes included in each sequential reaction. These can be modified based on
the most prevalent serotypes in any given geographic region but do require
validation to ensure no cross reaction between serotype primer sets. Three
such schemes based upon pneumococcal serotype prevalence in the USA, Africa,
and Latin America have been designed (Tables 6-8). These schemes will continue
to be refined as additional serotypes are added and primer sets updated to
improve specificity and sensitivity. The most current methods are described at
the CDC _Streptococcus_ website and should be consulted on a regular basis

##### Real-time PCR assays for serotyping _S. pneumoniae_

A number of real-time PCR assays for serotyping _S. pneumoniae_ have been
published in the literature and others are being developed (34, 40). These
real-time assays are recommended for determining serotypes from clinical
specimens when DNA may be present in low amounts and insufficient for
conventional multiplex PCR serotyping. Please see the _Streptococcus_
Laboratory website for an example.

Multiplex real-time PCR for pathogen detectionReal-time PCR allows for development of multiplex assays for detection of several genes in the same reaction by using specific probes with different fluorescent dye labels. Multiplex real-time PCR assays are available for detection of _N. meningitidis_ , _H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ in a single reaction. In addition, assays for serogrouping _N. meningitidis_ and serotyping _S. pneumoniae_ using a multiplex approach have also been developed. However, they are not recommended for routine use. The multiplex approach requires careful optimization. Changes in DNA polymerase or PCR reagent concentrations may lead to loss of sensitivity. The assays need to be optimized and re-evaluated, which is a very time-consuming process and requires a complete set of reference strains.

General considerationsBoth crude DNA preps (boiled cell suspension) and extracted genomic DNA can be used as template for PCR amplification. DNA extraction from clinical specimens or isolates should be performed in a separate room from the room used for PCR reaction assembly (prior to DNA addition). If separate rooms are not possible, separate laboratory benches should be used. The use of boiled extracts may limit the risk of contamination as it limits manipulation. Moreover, PCR on clinical specimens should be performed in a separate room from where bacteria are cultured with strict organization of the laboratory workflow. Use of a biological safety cabinet is necessary for infectious materials such as clinical isolates, blood, and CSF. Separate pipettes, laboratory coats, and gloves should be used for performing DNA extraction procedures. Signage indicating which spaces and equipment are DNA-free and which are used to prepare or manipulate DNA would be helpful. UV irradiation and decontamination of surfaces and equipment with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol should be performed after any manipulation of nucleic acids at the laboratory bench. Always use filter-barrier pipette tips and change and discard gloves frequently.

Extracting genomic DNA from clinical isolates and specimensEfficient extraction of the DNA template is a necessary step for any real-time PCR assay. The goal of DNA extraction is to lyse the bacterial cells in the specimens to maximize bacterial DNA yield and quality while removing any PCR inhibitors (i.e. salts, proteins), dissolve the DNA in a buffer compatible with the enzymes used in the next step and concentrating the DNA at the same time. When considering a DNA extraction method, it is important to select one that will produce an adequate DNA yield for detection by real-time PCR (dependant on the assay-specific lower limit of detection) without purifying potential PCR inhibitors as well. Things to consider are the type and volume of specimen, nucleic acid sought (DNA or RNA), concentration of the target DNA present in the specimen, impurities present that could act as PCR inhibitors, facilities/equipment available, and safety requirements. Generally, methods with fewer steps decrease chances of contamination and loss of DNA. Commercial methods are available for both cell lysis and purification and include silica membrane, spin column, and magnetic bead technology, in addition to biochemical and physical methods. In general, these methods produce adequate results as long as the protocol provided by the manufacturer is precisely followed.

Bacterial cell lysisThe first step in extracting and purifying bacterial DNA is to lyse the bacterial cell walls for maximum DNA yield. There are multiple ways to lyse bacterial cells, either physically or chemically, and this step can be optimized by considering the suspected bacteria and starting specimen material, as well as the materials available to each laboratory. Chemical or enzymatic based lysis methods are typically simpler to perform and can be more cost efficient. Both _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ are Gram negative and can be effectively lysed using lysis buffer containing protease such as Proteinase K along with a detergent. Incubation temperature and duration vary between organisms and specimen material. The optimal temperature range for Proteinase K activity is between 55-65°C. At temperatures above 65°C, the enzyme activity decreases. However, specimens incubated at 37°C can be left for longer incubation periods without affecting DNA quality. Specimens should be incubated until cells are completely lysed (when solution clears) and the time will vary between specimens. Once the bacteria are completely lysed one should proceed to the next step.For optimal yields of _S. pneumoniae_ , which is gram-positive, additional enzyme digestion with lysozyme and mutanolysin will help to degrade the higher content of peptidoglycan in the cell wall before being lysed with buffer. The temperature and length of the enzyme incubation will depend on the concentration and type of enzyme used, as well as the lysis buffer used. High temperature incubation and repeated freeze/thaw cycles are generally used with higher concentrations of cells, such as when extracting from cultures. Physical lysis can be performed using a liquid or pressure cell homogenizer, sonication, or shaking with glass beads, although some of these methods will require additional and sometimes costly equipment and they tend to shear the DNA in to smaller fragments.

Removal of eukaryotes from bloodIf DNA is being extracted from clinical specimens such as blood, CSF, or serum, considerations should be taken to remove potential PCR inhibitors from the surrounding material before lysing the cells. If the starting specimen is blood, steps to remove erythrocytes can results in higher DNA yield with fewer PCR inhibitors. Hemoglobin is very inhibitory to DNA polymerases. Erythrocytes can be removed through the use of a hypotonic buffer or by using gradient centrifugation to create a buffy coat in which leukocytes are concentrated. Bacteria in large volumes of clinical specimens can be concentrated by centrifugation or antigen capture to increase yield.

Purification of DNAPurification of the extraction product is important to remove any residual material that could potentially inhibit real-time PCR. Purification can be performed by many commercially available extraction kits or with the use of organic solvents, such as the chloroform/phenol method. Some methods may purify RNA along with DNA and as RNA may inhibit some reactions, use of RNAase improves purity of DNA as well. 

Phenol/Chloroform to remove cell debris and proteins

Phenol is a hazardous organic solvent and safety precautions should be taken
when working with phenol. Always use suitable chemical protection gloves when
handling phenol containing solutions. Specific waste procedures may be
required for the disposal of solutions containing phenol.

The dried DNA may be dissolved in sterile Tris buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and stored at 4°C for further manipulation or at -20°C for long-term storage.

Storage of DNA

Extracted and purified DNA should be stored in a designated elution buffer
from a commercial kit or in Tris buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Distilled
water can also be used but these specimens may experience degradation from
acid hydrolysis. DNA can be kept at 4°C for short periods of time and at -20°C
for long-term storage.

General considerationsPCR is a very sensitive method for amplifying a specific DNA target, but also very susceptible to contamination with extraneous DNA. Extra precautions should be taken to minimize such cross-contamination. It is recommended to physically separate the different steps including PCR reaction assembly, addition of template DNA to the reaction wells, and agarose gel detection of PCR products. If separate rooms are not possible, separate laboratory benches should be used for these steps. Working in an unventilated still air biocontainment cabinet (sometimes called a PCR hood), are also suggested to minimize cross-contamination. Separate micropipettors, laboratory coats, and gloves should be used for reaction assembly. Signage indicating which spaces and equipment are DNA-free and which are used to prepare or manipulate DNA would be helpful. Decontamination of surfaces and equipment with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol should be performed after any manipulation of nucleic acids at the laboratory bench. Always use filter-barrier pipette tips and change and discard gloves frequently.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gel

PCR products (10 µl) are run on 2% agarose gels to determine band sizes using
positive controls. A positive control for each serotype and a 50 bp ladder
molecular size marker should be included on each gel.

Visualize the gel under a UV light and print out or save the image, if possible.

Each reaction should give two bands, i.e., species-specific positive control (cpsA, although some are cpsA negative) and a serotype-specific band.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      9. Store the remainder of the amplicon at -20°C, if necessary.

Interpretation

Band sizes on agarose gelsmust match those of positive controls before
assigning a putative serotype (Figure 5). PCR reactions are setup sequentially
and will include those serotypes most frequently determined for each of the
schemes. For example, if a strain is negative for any of the serotypes
included in reaction 1 then proceed to reaction 2 and so forth until a
serotype is determined. If all reactions are completed for a specific scheme
and no serotype bands were identified that matched any of the positive
controls then the strain may be a nontypeable or one of the serotypes not yet
included in the scheme and would need to be further typed using the Quellung
reaction (see Chapter 8: Identification and Characterization of _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ ). Resolution of individual serotypes within some of the positive
reactions could be applicable in some circumstances. For example, to further
resolve a PCR positive reaction for 12F/12A/44/46 (reaction 3 in Table 6),
perform a Quellung reaction using type-specific antisera to determine whether
the strain has a 12F, 12A, 44, or 46 capsular type. It must be mentioned that
for practical reasons this is usually not necessary. For example, serotype 12F
is commonly detected in disease and carriage specimens, while serotypes 12A,
44, and 46 are extremely rare.

Helpful tips

The positive pneumococcal control band for _cpsA_ can be negative in 1-2% of
PCR-serotypeable isolates. This is most often encountered in serotypes 25 and
38, but has also rarely been found for serotypes 14 and 35A. Although a _cpsA_
negative result is relatively rare, at present a negative _cpsA_ does not
necessarily equate to a non-serotypeable isolate or a pneumococcus-negative
clinical specimen.

Quality control

A positive control for each serotype included in the PCR reaction(s) should be
run on each gel to ensure that bands are assigned to the correct serotype.

Workstation for real-time PCR reaction set-upThe extremely sensitive lower limit of detection of real-time PCR assays increases the chance of detection of cross-contamination with other DNA. Extra precautions should be taken to minimize such cross-contamination. It is strongly recommended that reaction assembly be performed in one room, which is designated a clean room, while DNA extraction from clinical specimens or isolates and addition of template DNA to the reaction wells should be performed in a separate room, which is designated a dirty room. If separate rooms are not possible, separate laboratory benches should be used for these two steps. Working in an unventilated biocontainment cabinet (sometimes called a PCR hood), is also suggested to minimize cross-contamination. Use of a biological safety cabinet is necessary for infectious materials but does not provide significant protection from amplicon cross-contamination. Separate micropipettors, laboratory coats, and gloves should be used for DNA extraction and reaction assembly. Signage indicating which spaces and equipment are DNA-free and which are used to prepare or manipulate DNA would be helpful. Decontamination of surfaces and equipment with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol should be done after any manipulation of nucleic acids at the laboratory bench. Always use filter-barrier pipette tips and change and discard gloves frequently. Even though real-time PCR is more expensive, it may be advisable to use given that it is a closed system and has much less potential for cross-contamination of the workspace.

Equipment for real-time PCR analysisThe main piece of equipment needed is the real-time PCR machine. There are more than 30 different real-time PCR thermocycler models that are manufactured by 14 companies (13). When choosing the machine to buy, be sure to consider the fluorescent filters that it will contain; the filters in the machine must be able to detect the wavelengths of light that will be emitted by the fluorophores conjugated to the probes. An accompanying desktop or laptop computer and appropriate software will be necessary to view and analyze the results that are generated by the machine. Given their replacement cost and sensitivity to damage by electrical surges, it is strongly recommended that this machine and computer be plugged directly into a battery backup with surge protection, to protect them from fluctuations in current, to protect your data, and to keep the reactions running in case power is lost.

Table 2 lists the recommended nucleotide sequences, working concentrations,
and suggested chemical modifications of the primers and probes for _N.
meningitidis_ , _H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ species detection
targeting the _ctrA_ or _sodC_ , _hpd_ , and _lytA_ genes, respectively.
Primers and probes for the detection of _N. meningitidis_ serogroups (Table 3)
and _H. influenzae_ serotypes (Table 4) are also given. Additional _S.
pneumoniae_ serotype assays are currently in development. A two-tiered
approach for detecting and characterizing bacterial meningitis pathogens is
recommended with the first tier being species-specific detection of _N.
meningitidis,_ _H. influenzae,_ or _S. pneumoniae_ with subsequent
serogroup/serotype determination of any positive specimens (Figure 8).

Primers and probes must be diluted from concentrated stocks into working
stocks. It is convenient to dilute working stocks to concentrations that will
allow 2 µl of each primer and probe to be added to the master mix per
reaction. The optimized working stock concentration of each primer and probe
for the assays described here that will allow 2 µl of each to be added to the
master mix is presented in the tables above.

To calculate the required dilution from concentrated stock to working stocks,
use the formula: (Concentration1)(Volume1)=(Concentration2)(Volume2). Example:
A 500 µl working stock of the _sacB_ forward primer is needed. For the
purposes of this example, the _sacB_ forward primer has a stock concentration
of 220 µM. Table 3 shows that the working concentration of the _sacB_ forward
primer should be 3.75 µM; therefore the equation becomes:

> (220 µM is the given concentration of the concentrated stock)(x µl of
> concentrated stock) = (3.75 µM is the desired concentration of the working
> stock)(500 µl is the desired volume of working stock)

Or: (220 µM)(x µl) / (3.75 µM)(500 µl)

Solve for x. x = (3.75 µM)(500 µl) / 220 µM = (1875 µM/µl) / 220 µM = 8.5 µl
of concentrated stock.

Next, to calculate how much water to add to x µl of concentrated stock
calculated above:  
500 µl total volume of working stock - x µl of concentrated stock = y µl of
water to add

Therefore, using the example above: 500 µl - 8.5 µl = 491.5 µl of water.

Of this working stock of the primer, add 2 µl to the master mix per specimen
to be tested.

When diluting primers and probes, it is important to use filter tips and to
work in a clean space (i.e., free of template DNA) to avoid cross-
contamination of these reagents. It is optimal to use a clean PCR cabinet or
hood if one is available. Concentrated stocks of primers and probes should be
stored at -20°C. If used on a regular basis, the working stocks can be stored
at 4°C. Be sure to store probes in the dark, since they are light-sensitive
(ideally, covered in aluminum foil and in a box). Concentrated stocks of
probes are especially susceptible to degradation due to their fluorescent tags
and should not be freeze-thawed more than 5 times. Primers should not be
freeze-thawed more than 20 times (46). Therefore, it is recommended that the
primer and probe stocks be aliquoted upon their arrival, before initially
freezing them for longer-term storage.

The length of time for which primers and probes can be stored in this manner
will vary. Performing positive controls with each reaction will help you to
determine when your primers and probes need to be replaced.

Performing real-time PCR

General considerations

Before setting up the reactions, the real-time PCR machine should be turned
on. For some machines, it can take about 20 minutes for the lamp to warm up.

The high sensitivity of real-time PCR significantly increases the risk for
cross-contamination. Therefore, the following precautions are recommended:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Separate rooms are suggested for handling DNA template (dirty room) and for handling other reagents (clean room) to avoid cross-contamination.

Assays are carried out in 25 µl reaction volumes, using a commercial PCR
master mix according to the manufacturer's instructions. Per sample to be
tested, each reaction mix contains: 2 µl of DNA sample, 2 µl of each primer, 2
µl of probe, 12.5 µl of master mix, and 4.5 µl of sterile, PCR-grade water.
Add enough reagents for 1-2 extra reactions than the number of specimens there
are to be tested to ensure there will be enough mix.

Positive and negative controls are extremely important to ensure the
laboratorian that contamination of reagents and workspace has not generated
false positives and that the assay is detecting targets as expected. Non-
template controls (NTCs) contain all reagents except for template DNA;
instead, 2 µl of sterile, PCR-grade water should be added to the NTC reaction
wells. It is advisable to add water used in the clean room to at least two NTC
reaction wells and to add water used in the dirty room to at least two NTC
reaction wells. If either NTC reaction generates an amplification curve that
crosses the threshold, the water from that room should be discarded and
replaced, and NTCs should be performed again to determine if other reagents
are the source of contamination. An additional control for contamination at
the DNA extraction step is the extraction of water, as suggested in the
extraction protocol. If the extracted water negative control(s) generate an
amplification curve that crosses the threshold, then contamination occurred
during the DNA extraction process, and replacement of extraction reagents with
new ones and cleaning of workspace and pipettes is recommended. Positive
control reactions should be performed using DNA from known positive isolates.
Dilute the positive control DNA in order to decrease the likelihood of
contamination of the PCR workspace, thereby avoiding false positives. In
summary, for each target gene to be detected (i.e., for each mix that is made
up), the following controls should be run:

labeled with either the specimen name or type of control. In this case, three
assays are being run on same plate and each assay is color-coded: _sodC_ (or
_ctrA_ ) for _N. meningitidis_ detection in pale red; _hpd_ for _H.
influenzae_ detection in green, and _lytA_ for _S. pneumoniae_ detection in
blue. The non-template controls (ntc) for both the clean and dirty rooms are
done in duplicate for each assay type (more can be added if the user deems it
necessary). One positive control well should be used for each assay type and
is labeled _sodC , hpd_ , and _lytA_. The water extraction to control for
contamination during DNA extraction is labeled Extracted H2O. The 17 unknown
specimens are labeled unk-1 to unk-17. The panel to the right depicts the

In the clean room/hood, gather reagents: commercial PCR master mix, primers, probes, and PCR grade water. If they are used infrequently enough and are therefore stored at -20°C, allow working stocks of primers and probes to thaw completely before use.Vortex or flick each tube before using. Assemble one master mix per primer and probe set to be used. For each extraction to be tested, the master mix should contain:12.5 µl of master mix  
4.5 µl of sterile, PCR-grade water  
2 µl of forward primer  
2 µl of reverse primer  
2 µl of probe  
23 µl total before adding 2 µl DNAWhen calculating volumes of master mix
reagents, add enough master mix reagents for 2 extra reactions to ensure there
will be enough mix.

Pipette 23 µl of this master mix into each appropriate well of a 96-well plate, according to the plate template worksheet. Add 2 µl of PCR-grade water to the clean NTC wells and then cap only that row. Ensure that the lid is flush with the plate to avoid evaporation from wells during PCR.

Figure 7. Amplification plot generated by a real-time PCR assay. This is a
graph showing a plot of amplification cycle numbers on the X axis versus
fluorescence units (dRn) on the Y axis for each reaction. dRn is the baseline
subtracted fluorescent reading normalized to the reference dye. The green line
of the fluorescence threshold is highlighted by the black arrow and the
exponential phase is highlighted by the red arrow.

The readout of the data generated by real-time PCR machines will come in two
main formats: amplification plots (Figure 7) and plate sample values. The
curves that are generated should be sigmoidal in shape, ideally plateauing as
the last cycle is approached, indicating complete use of reactants. The cycle
number at which the fluorescence curve for each sample crosses the
fluorescence threshold (green line in the above graph, which is generated
automatically by the data analysis software) is referred to as the cycle
threshold value, or Ct value. The plate sample values format of data readout
is simply a listing of the Ct value generated by each reaction. The
fluorescence threshold should be set higher than the negative controls and
negative specimens and should be within the start of the exponential phase
(see Figure 7). In an optimal PCR reaction running at 100% efficiency, exact
doubling of the PCR product occurs at every cycle during the exponential
phase. The laboratorian should carefully examine each curve and document all
Ct values obtained. If possible, it is recommended that the electronic data
files be saved for each run of the real-time PCR machine, including
amplification plots for future reference.

As with any experiment, results for the unknowns cannot be evaluated without
first assessing the results for the controls. NTCs and negative controls
should give "No Ct" and should produce amplification curves that are straight
lines near zero. Positive controls should give Ct values less than 35, and the
amplifications plots of the positive controls and any unknown specimens that
generate curves should all be sigmoidal. The commercial master mix used may
contain a reference dye, which is often ROX. If the real-time PCR machine is
working properly, the amplification plot and plate sample value for ROX in
each reaction should resemble those of the NTCs and negative controls. If
these criteria are not met, it will be difficult to interpret the results of
the unknown samples. If this is the case, refer to the troubleshooting section
below.

When determining whether to call an unknown specimen positive or negative for
an etiology, the following cutoff values are used in the Meningitis Laboratory
at CDC:

Positive = Ct ≤ 35  
Negative = Ct > 40  
Equivocal = Ct 36-40

Those with Ct values between 36 and 40 are considered equivocal and should be retested after diluting the template DNA 1:4 and 1:10 in PCR-grade water to reduce any inhibitors that may be interfering with the reaction. If the Ct value decreases to ≤35, the specimen should be considered positive.

pathogens by PCR. Once DNA template is prepared from either a clinical
specimen, an isolate, or from sampling a bottle of inoculated Tran-Isolate

assay.  
1 It is not always practical to test for all serogroups for which assays are
available in a laboratory. Testing algorithms may be set up in laboratories
with previous knowledge of the predominance or lack of serogroups within that
particular geographic region to test for the most common serogroups first.
Modifications may be made to the testing algorithm for any laboratory based on
information about current strains that are circulating in the region. For
example, in Africa, testing to detect serogroups A and W135 (and X in some
regions) should be adequate to characterize most specimens. Specimens reacting
negatively in the A and W135 assays should then be tested using the other
available assays, particularly C, Y, X and B. Nearly all invasive specimens
are serogroupable, if they are tested against a comprehensive panel of assays
and proper controls are used.

2 It is not always practical to test for all serotypes for which assays are
available in a laboratory. If a Hib vaccination program does not exist or is
fairly new, testing all _hpd_ positive specimens for Hib first may be adequate
to characterize most specimens.

3 For bacterial isolates confirmed as _S. pneumoniae_ by microbiological
methods, conventional multiplex PCR serotyping is used. For clinical specimens
that are _lyt_ A-positive by real-time PCR and have Ct values ≤30,
conventional multiplex PCR serotyping can be used. If Ct values are >30, then
a real-time PCR serotyping approach is recommended for increased sensitivity.
