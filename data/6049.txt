Prevent Heat-Related Illness

Workers who are exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may be at
risk of heat stress. Exposure to extreme heat can result in occupational
illnesses and injuries. Heat stress can result in heat stroke, heat
exhaustion, heat cramps, or heat rashes. Heat can also increase the risk of
injuries in workers as it may result in sweaty palms, fogged-up safety
glasses, and dizziness. Burns may also occur as a result of accidental contact
with hot surfaces or steam.

Workers at risk of heat stress include outdoor workers and workers in hot
environments such as firefighters, bakery workers, farmers, construction
workers, miners, boiler room workers, factory workers, and others. Workers at
greater risk of heat stress include those who are 65 years of age or older,
are overweight, have heart disease or high blood pressure, or take medications
that may be affected by extreme heat.

Prevention of heat stress in workers is important. Employers should provide
training to workers so they understand what heat stress is, how it affects
their health and safety, and how it can be prevented.
