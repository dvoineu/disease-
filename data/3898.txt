###  **Summary**

**What is already known about this topic?**

Targets for reducing tuberculosis (TB) have been set in a World Health
Organization (WHO) initiative, The End TB Strategy. Achieving these targets
will require substantial annual reductions in the incidence of TB and the
number of TB deaths.

**What is added by this report?**

In 2018, an estimated 10 million incident TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths
occurred, reductions of 2% and 5%, respectively, from 2017. TB epidemiology
varied by WHO region.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Innovative approaches to case finding, scale-up of TB preventive treatment,
use of newer TB treatment regimens, and prevention and control of HIV will
contribute to decreasing TB incidence.

Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single
infectious disease agent ( _1_ ), including among persons living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ( _2_ ). A World Health Organization
(WHO) initiative, The End Tuberculosis Strategy, set ambitious targets for
2020-2035, including 20% reduction in TB incidence and 35% reduction in the
absolute number of TB deaths by 2020 and 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95%
reduction in TB deaths by 2035, compared with 2015 ( _3_ ). This report
evaluated global progress toward these targets based on data reported by WHO (
_1_ ). Annual TB data routinely reported to WHO by 194 member states were used
to estimate TB incidence and mortality overall and among persons with HIV
infection, TB-preventive treatment (TPT) initiation, and drug-resistant TB for
2018 ( _1_ ). In 2018, an estimated 10 million persons had incident TB, and
1.5 million TB-related deaths occurred, representing 2% and 5% declines from
2017, respectively. The number of persons with both incident and prevalent TB
remained highest in the WHO South-East Asia and African regions. Decreases in
the European region were on track to meet 2020 targets. Globally, among
persons living with HIV, 862,000 incident TB cases occurred, and 1.8 million
persons initiated TPT. Rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB occurred
among 3.4% of persons with new TB and 18% among persons who were previously
treated for TB (overall, among 4.8% of persons with TB). The modest decreases
in the number of persons with TB and the number of TB-related deaths were
consistent with recent trends, and new and substantial progress was observed
in increased TPT initiation among persons living with HIV. However, to meet
the global targets for 2035, more intensive efforts are needed by public
health partners to decrease TB incidence and deaths and increase the number of
persons receiving TB curative and preventive treatment. Innovative approaches
to case finding, scale-up of TB preventive treatment, use of newer TB
treatment regimens, and prevention and control of HIV will contribute to
decreasing TB.

TPT (the most common global regimen consists of daily isoniazid for ≥6 months)
has been demonstrated to prevent TB disease among persons who might be
infected with TB and are at risk for TB disease ( _4_ ). Current WHO
recommendations advise providing a course of TPT to all persons living with
HIV and to all household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed
pulmonary TB disease ( _5_ ).

TB data are reported to WHO annually by 194 member states and are reviewed and
validated in collaboration with reporting entities ( _1_ , _6_ ). For each
country, 2018 disease incidence (per 100,000 HIV-negative persons and per 100
persons living with HIV) was estimated from 1) TB prevalence surveys; 2)
notifications from country surveillance systems adjusted by a standard factor
to account for underreporting, overdiagnosis, and underdiagnosis; 3) national
inventory studies that measure the level of underreporting of detected persons
with TB combined with capture-recapture modeling; and 4) national notification
data supplemented with expert opinion about case-detection gaps. Among HIV-
negative persons, TB mortality rate estimates were based on all-cause
mortality data from civil registration and vital statistics, mortality
surveys, or the product of TB incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) ( _1_ ).
Among persons living with HIV, TB mortality rates were derived from the
product of incidence and CFR. Data on persons receiving TPT represent numbers
directly reported to WHO.

In 2018, an estimated 10 million persons had incident TB (132 per 100,000
population), a 2% decline from 2017 (Figure 1). Incidence has declined by an
average of 1.6% per year since 2000. In 2018, 7.0 million persons globally
were notified of their TB-positive results, representing 70% of the estimated
number of persons with incident TB, an increase from the 6.4 million persons
(64%) notified in 2017. In 2018, 69% of all persons with incident TB received
anti-TB treatment, compared with 64% in 2017. The estimated number of TB-
related deaths declined 5%, from 1.57 million in 2017 to 1.49 million in 2018
(CFR = 15%) (Figure 2). An estimated 862,000 persons living with HIV had
incident TB in 2018, accounting for 8.6% of all persons with TB. Within this
group, the estimated annual TB incidences were 6% in 2000, 2.5% in 2017, and
2.3% in 2018. In 2018, an estimated 251,000 TB deaths among persons living
with HIV occurred (CFR = 29%). Overall, an estimated 484,000 persons had
incident rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB in 2018, representing
4.8% of all persons with TB, 3.4% of persons with a new TB diagnosis, and 18%
of persons previously treated for TB. An estimated 214,000 persons died of
either rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB (CFR = 44%) in 2018.
Among persons with rifampicin-resistant TB, 78% were estimated to have
multidrug-resistant TB.

The WHO region of South-East Asia accounted for the highest percentage of TB
cases (44% of all persons with TB) in 2018 (TB incidence = 220 per 100,000
population) (Table). TB incidence also was high in the African region (231 per
100,000 population) and, in 2018, this region accounted for 71% of all persons
living with HIV with TB worldwide, similar to 2017. In the European region, TB
incidence declined 15% since 2015 to 28 per 100,000 population. However, the
proportion of persons with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB in
this region (30%) remained substantially higher than that in all other regions
(range = 3.1%-5.4%), and overall incidence of rifampicin-resistant or
multidrug-resistant TB is similar to the Africa and South-East Asia regions.

In 2018, 65 countries reported data on TPT use among eligible persons living
with HIV and 109 countries among children aged <5 years. Among these
countries, 1.8 million persons living with HIV received TPT in 2018 (an 88%
increase from 960,000 in 2017). Less progress was observed among eligible
children aged <5 years: 350,000 children received TPT in 2018, a 20% increase
compared with 292,000 in 2017.

## Discussion

WHO's initiative, The End TB Strategy ( _3_ ), has ambitious targets for
2020-2035, and the 2018 United Nations High Level Meeting on TB (UNHLM-TB)
declaration established targets for 2022 that included providing TB treatment
for 40 million persons infected with TB and providing TPT to 30 million
persons, including 6 million persons living with HIV ( _7_ ). Although some
progress was made in 2018 toward meeting global targets, the overall number of
persons with TB and TB-associated deaths decreased only slightly from 2017.
Notable highlights in progress include an increased proportion of persons
notified of TB-positive results, increased TPT among persons living with HIV,
and decreased TB incidence in the European region.

The African region continues to have the highest HIV prevalence; thus, a large
proportion of the TB cases in this region were associated with HIV. Similarly,
the TB CFR among persons living with HIV continues to be high, and
consequently, overall TB CFR was highest in this region. Whereas the European
region is on track to meet 2020 targets, the overall proportion of persons
with rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB remains a substantial
challenge. Recent progress in the development of new treatment regimens for TB
and updated WHO guidelines suggest that all persons with rifampicin-resistant
or multidrug-resistant TB could benefit from effective all-oral treatment
regimens ( _8_ ).

A key UNHLM-TB target is to initiate 30 million persons on TPT by 2022.
Although the overall number of TPT initiations remains well below the target,
including among household members of persons with TB, the number of persons
living with HIV who initiated TPT nearly doubled from 2017 to 2018 and appears
on track to meet the target of 6 million by 2022 ( _1_ ). Substantial
improvements in TPT initiation in other populations, including children aged
<5 years who are household contacts of persons with TB, are necessary to reach
the UNHLM-TB targets. Although daily isoniazid has been the primary TPT
regimen globally, an alternative regimen of a 12-dose, once-weekly combination
of isoniazid and rifapentine has been demonstrated to have similar efficacy
with lower toxicity ( _4_ ) and is anticipated to be increasingly used as a
TPT regimen.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First
underlying data quality, particularly for surveillance, might affect the
accuracy of estimates. Second, the differing methodologies used to generate
country-level estimates might affect the comparability of estimates among
regions and countries.

Global targets to end TB represent ambitious goals; however, achieving them
will result in the prevention of disease and death among millions of persons.
Although progress continues to be made, at the current pace of progress it
remains unlikely that 2035 targets will be met. The scale-up of TB disease
surveillance, initiation of TPT among eligible persons, and effective
treatment need to continue to improve. Much more intensive efforts to find,
cure, and prevent all cases of TB are necessary to meet global targets and end
the public health burden of TB.
