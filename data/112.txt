## Summary

A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye. It affects your vision.
Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all
Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.

A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to
the other. Common symptoms are

  * Blurry vision
  * Colors that seem faded
  * Glare - headlights, lamps or sunlight may seem too bright. You may also see a halo around lights.
  * Not being able to see well at night
  * Double vision 
  * Frequent prescription changes in your eye wear 

Cataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare
sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option.
It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.
Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may
help to delay cataracts.
