## Summary

Pests live where they are not wanted or cause harm to crops, people, or
animals. Pesticides can help get rid of them. Pesticides are not just insect
killers. They also include chemicals to control weeds, rodents, mildew, germs,
and more. Many household products contain pesticides.

Pesticides can protect your health by killing germs, animals, or plants that
could hurt you. However, they can also be harmful to people or pets. You might
want to try non-chemical methods first. If you do need a pesticide, use it
correctly. Be especially careful around children and pets. Proper disposal of
pesticides is also important - it can help protect the environment.

Biologically-based pesticides are becoming more popular. They often are safer
than traditional pesticides.
