# Methylmalonic acid blood test

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

The methylmalonic acid blood test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid in
the blood.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.

## How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is necessary.

## How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.
Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterwards, there may be some throbbing
or slight bruising. This soon goes away.

## Why the Test is Performed

Methylmalonic acid is a substance produced when proteins, called amino acids,
in the body break down.

The health care provider may order this test if there are signs of certain
genetic disorders, such as methylmalonic acidemia. Testing for this disorder
is often done as part of a newborn screening exam.

This test may also be done with other tests to check for a vitamin B12
deficiency.

## Normal Results

Normal values are 0.07 to 0.27 micromoles per liter.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs
use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor
about the meaning of your specific test results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

A higher than normal value may be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or
methylmalonic acidemia.

## Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries
vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the
other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:

    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Multiple punctures to locate veins
    * Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
    * Excessive bleeding
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
