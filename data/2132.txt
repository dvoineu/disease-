## Summary

Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest
food, store energy, and remove poisons.

There are many kinds of liver diseases:

    * Diseases caused by viruses, such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C
    * Diseases caused by drugs, poisons, or too much alcohol. Examples include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.
    * Liver cancer
    * Inherited diseases, such as hemochromatosis and Wilson disease

Symptoms of liver disease can vary, but they often include swelling of the
abdomen and legs, bruising easily, changes in the color of your stool and
urine, and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no
symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for
liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.
