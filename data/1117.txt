Weighted results are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending
public schools (and in some cases, public and private schools) in each
jurisdiction. With weighted data, it is possible to say, for example, "X% of
students in state Y never or rarely wore a seat belt when riding in a car
driven by someone else."  
2 Unweighted data represent only the students who completed the survey. The
following states conducted a high school survey in 2017 and did not obtain
