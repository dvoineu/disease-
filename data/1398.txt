Travelers Information

People Under Investigation (PUI) in the United States*†‡

Cases of COVID-19 Reported in the US, by Source of Exposure Travel-related |
1,388  
---|---  
Close contact | 4,325  
Under investigation | 233,566  
**Total cases** | 239,279  
  
* Data include both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC since January 21, 2020, with the exception of testing results for persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan. State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.

† CDC is no longer reporting the number of persons under investigation (PUIs)
that have been tested, as well as PUIs that have tested negative. Now that
states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC's numbers are not
representative of all testing being done nationwide.
