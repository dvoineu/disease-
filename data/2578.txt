## Information

**Why get vaccinated?**

 **Recombinant zoster (shingles) vaccine** can prevent **shingles**.

 **Shingles** (also called herpes zoster, or just zoster) is a painful skin
rash, usually with blisters. In addition to the rash, shingles can cause
fever, headache, chills, or upset stomach. More rarely, shingles can lead to
pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or
death.

The most common complication of shingles is long-term nerve pain called
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN occurs in the areas where the shingles rash
was, even after the rash clears up. It can last for months or years after the
rash goes away. The pain from PHN can be severe and debilitating.

About 10% to 18% of people who get shingles will experience PHN. The risk of
PHN increases with age. An older adult with shingles is more likely to develop
PHN and have longer lasting and more severe pain than a younger person with
shingles.

Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes
chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body and can
cause shingles later in life. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to
another, but the virus that causes shingles can spread and cause chickenpox in
someone who had never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine.

 **Recombinant shingles vaccine**

Recombinant shingles vaccine provides strong protection against shingles. By
preventing shingles, recombinant shingles vaccine also protects against PHN.

 **Recombinant shingles vaccine is the preferred vaccine for the prevention of
shingles**. However, a different vaccine, live shingles vaccine, may be used
in some circumstances.

The recombinant shingles vaccine is recommended for **adults 50 years and
older** without serious immune problems. It is given as a two-dose series.

This vaccine is also recommended for people who have already gotten another
type of shingles vaccine, the live shingles vaccine. There is no live virus in
this vaccine.

Shingles vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

 **Talk with your health care provider**

Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:

    * Has had an **allergic reaction after a previous dose of recombinant shingles vaccine** , or has any **severe, life-threatening allergies**.
    * Is **pregnant or breastfeeding**.
    * Is **currently experiencing an episode of shingles**. 

In some cases, your provider may decide to postpone shingles vaccination to a
future visit.

People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are
moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before
getting recombinant shingles vaccine.

Your provider can give you more information.

 **Risks of a vaccine reaction**

    * A sore arm with mild or moderate pain is very common after recombinant shingles vaccine, affecting about 80% of vaccinated people. Redness and swelling can also happen at the site of the injection.
    * Tiredness, muscle pain, headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, and nausea happen after vaccination in more than half of people who receive recombinant shingles vaccine. 

In clinical trials, about 1 out of 6 people who got recombinant zoster vaccine
experienced side effects that prevented them from doing regular activities.
Symptoms usually went away on their own in 2 to 3 days.

You should still get the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine even if you
had one of these reactions after the first dose.

People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell
your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.

As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a
severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.

 **What if there is a serious problem?**

An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the
clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the
face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or
weakness), call **9-1-1** and get the person to the nearest hospital.

For other signs that concern you, call your provider.

Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS). Your provider will usually file this report, or you can do it
yourself. Visit the VAERS website (vaers.hhs.gov) or call 1-800-822-7967.
_VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff do not give medical
advice_.

 **How can I learn more?**

    * Ask your provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information.
    * Contact your local or state health department.
    * Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by calling **1-800-232-4636** ( **1-800-CDC-I** NFO) or visiting CDC's vaccines website.
