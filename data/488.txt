## Summary

Swine flu is an infection caused by a virus. It's named for a virus that pigs
can get. People do not normally get swine flu, but human infections can and do
happen. In 2009 a strain of swine flu called H1N1 infected many people around
the world.

The virus is contagious and can spread from human to human. Symptoms of swine
flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include
fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.

There are antiviral medicines you can take to prevent or treat swine flu.
There is a vaccine available to protect against swine flu. You can help
prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses like influenza by

    * Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
    * Washing your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. You can also use alcohol-based hand cleaners.
    * Avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
    * Trying to avoid close contact with sick people.
    * Staying home from work or school if you are sick.
