The results of that conversation was the STD/STI Framing Conversation Report.Cdc-pdfAlthough there are some signs of progress, large disparities by age and race still exist. The STD/STI Framing Report provides the workgroup's suggestions and actionable items for consideration for CDC to combat this persistent high burden of STDs. This report is useful for governmental agencies, non-governmental agencies, and non-traditional partners working with ethnic and minority communities in the health and medical fields.
