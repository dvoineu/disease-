## Summary

Shots may hurt a little, but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse.
Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots, or vaccinations, are
essential. They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis
B, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations
are important for adults as well as children.

Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to
combat them. Once it does, the immune system "remembers" the germ and can
fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When
given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond
and thus build immunity.

Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and
surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.
