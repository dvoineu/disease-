facts](/tetanus/images/header_vp1.jpg)

Tetanus is an infection caused by bacteria called _Clostridium tetani_. When
the bacteria invade the body, they produce a poison (toxin) that causes
painful muscle contractions. Another name for tetanus is "lockjaw". It often
causes a person's neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the
mouth or swallow. CDC recommends vaccines for infants, children, teens, and
adults to prevent tetanus.
