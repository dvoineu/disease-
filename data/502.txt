## Summary

Testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped
organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. You can get
cancer in one or both testicles.

Testicular cancer mainly affects young men between the ages of 20 and 39. It
is also more common in men who

    * Have had abnormal testicle development
    * Have had an undescended testicle
    * Have a family history of the cancer

Symptoms include pain, swelling, or lumps in your testicles or groin area.
Doctors use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to
diagnose testicular cancer. Most cases can be treated, especially if found
early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.
Regular exams after treatment are important.

Treatments may also cause infertility. If you may want children later on, you
should consider sperm banking before treatment.
