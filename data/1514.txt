Many women need to take medicine to stay healthy during pregnancy, including
medicine for mental health conditions. Two studies from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) **found that** **a small number of women
reported** **taking benzodiazepines or atypical antipsychotic medicines during
pregnancy.** Benzodiazepines are medicines used to treat anxietyexternal icon
and atypical antipsychotics are medicines used to treat schizophreniaexternal
icon, bipolar disorderexternal icon, and other mental health conditions.

Women should discuss options for managing their mental health conditions with
their doctors if or when they start planning for pregnancy.

### Main Findings

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Fewer than 1 in 100 women took benzodiazepine or atypical antipsychotic medicines during pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Researchers found a small increased risk for some birth defects following use of these medicines during pregnancy. However, it is important to remember that the risk for birth defects is still quite low. Researchers don't know if the risk for birth defects is linked to using benzodiazepines or atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy or to the underlying mental health conditions that these medicines are used to treat.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Women shouldn't start any new medicines or stop a current medicine without talking to a doctor. In some cases, avoiding or stopping a medicine during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking that medicine. Women should discuss options for managing their mental health conditions with their doctors if or when they start planning for pregnancy **.**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * In these studies, women who took benzodiazepine or atypical antipsychotic medicines were also more likely to have other factors that increase the chance of birth defects, like smoking during pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Researchers only studied a small number of children with birth defects, so there is still limited information on the safety of these medicines taken during pregnancy.

###  About Birth Defects

Birth defects are structural changes present at birth that can affect almost
any part or parts of the body such as the heart, brain, or foot. Birth defects
are common, costly, and critical conditions that affect 1 in 33 babies born in
the United States.

### Our Work

CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD)
is working to improve the health of women and babies through its Treating for
Two: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy program. Treating for Two works to
understand the safety or risk of using certain medicines during pregnancy.
