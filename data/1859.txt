## Summary

Organ donation takes healthy organs and tissues from one person for
transplantation into another. Experts say that the organs from one donor can
save or help as many as 50 people. Organs you can donate include

    * Internal organs: Kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs 
    * Skin 
    * Bone and bone marrow 
    * Cornea

Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some
organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.

People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age
18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you
are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card.
You should also let your family know your wishes.
