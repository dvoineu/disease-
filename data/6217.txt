Contaminated Waste

Related Pages

Page Summary

 **Who this is for** : Public health, state and/or local authorities who may
have to decontaminate or arrange for a contract company to decontaminate a
U.S. residence and remove contaminated waste because someone living there was
confirmed to have Ebola virus disease (EVD).

Members of the general public who have concerns regarding their residence and
environmental contamination because a member of the residence, whether owned
or rented, had a confirmed case of EVD should contact local public health
and/or assigned authorities for Ebola emergency response in their location. If
the public health and/or assigned authorities cannot be reached, please call
the CDC Emergency Operations Center at: 1-770-488-7100.

**What this is for** : These recommendations list effective disinfectant
products and procedures, guidance for contract companies to follow in dealing
with contaminated wastes, and guidance on how to use personal protective
equipment (PPE).

**How to use** : Use this document for guidance on decontaminating a residence
and disposing of waste that could be contaminated.

Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims for hospital disinfection (or the equivalent microbial pathogen claims) and claims against nonenveloped viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus). These products are broadly antiviral and capable of inactivating both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, including Ebola virus. These disinfectants should be used in accordance with the manufacturer's labeled instructions.One simple way to identify an appropriate product effective against Ebola virus is to use a product included in EPA's List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virusexternal icon.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Level of cleaning and decontamination** : Once a person has been confirmed to have EVD, the way to decontaminate the residence depends on the person's symptoms at the time they were in the residence: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Cleaning by residents - If the person with EVD **had only a fever** with no gastrointestinal (diarrhea, vomiting) or hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms while he or she was in the residence, the person should not be contaminating their environment. The remaining members of the residence can clean and launder as normal using detergent and/or disinfectant.

OSHA provides guidance for cleaning and decontaminating in non-healthcare settingsexternal icon. Any contract company conducting such work must comply with its state's Ebola policies and with OSHA standardsexternal icon for, among others that may apply, bloodborne pathogensexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1030), PPEexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.132), respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134), and hazard communicationexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1200) (for example, for chemical hazards). In states that operate their own occupational safety and health programs, different or additional requirements may exist.

The public health authorities can assist in finding a qualified contract
company. Any contract company conducting such work must comply with its
state's Ebola policies and with OSHA standardsexternal icon for, among others
that may apply, bloodborne pathogensexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1030),
PPEexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.132), respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134),
and hazard communicationexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1200) (for example, for
chemical hazards). In states that operate their own occupational safety and
health programs, different or additional requirements may exist. The contract
company will assess the residence to determine the proper decontamination and
disposal procedures. **Only areas/rooms with contamination from diarrhea,
vomiting, unexplained bleeding, and/or other body fluids will need to be
cleaned and disinfected.**

requirements, PPE, and waste removal

Recommendations for the contract company to follow are described in CDC's

One simple way to identify an appropriate product effective against Ebola virus is to use a product included in EPA's List L: Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virusexternal icon. Any EPA-registered disinfectant that is effective against a nonenveloped virus will also be effective against Ebola virus.

Store the properly contained contaminated material in a room that is not being used until it can be collected for disposal.

If a contract company is handling the waste, requirements in OSHA standards, including Bloodborne Pathogensexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1030) may also apply.

**Contract company requirements and PPE (biological and chemical)** : Contract
company employees must be properly trained. The contract company is
responsible for selecting and providing PPE to protect their workers from
exposure to Ebola and to chemical hazards from the cleaning and disinfectant
agents. Refer to the OSHA PPE Selection Matrixpdf iconexternal icon for
assistance in determining the appropriate PPE. Where respiratory hazards
exist, such as from aerosolized viral particles or chemicals used in cleaning
and disinfection, workers must use NIOSH-approved respirators, be fit-tested
before using respirators, and be medically cleared. (Note: Medical clearance
for respirators is determined by the institution, which may involve a
questionnaire for screening, physical examination and spirometry, and/or chest
X-ray).
