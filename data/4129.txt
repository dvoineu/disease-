**Intervention Setting:**  
Out patient chest clinic at Central Hospital of Vest-Agder, Kristiansand,
Norway

**Target Population:**  
Adults with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
aged 18-70 years not suffering from other serious diseases (e.g. unstable
coronary heart disease, heart failure, serious hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, and kidney or liver failure) were included in the study. Subjects
with asthma were to have a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) equal
to or higher than 80% of predicted value in stable phase along with a positive
reversibility test, a documented 20% spontaneous variability, or a positive
metacholine test.

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to assess the effect of education on patients with
asthma and COPD on health-related quality of life (HRqol). The intervention
group received a booklet with essential information about asthma medication,
compliance, self-care, and a self-management plan. Education consisted of four
group sessions with five to eight persons on separate days. The first group
session, presented by a physician, focused on airway smooth muscle cramp,
inflammatory components of obstruction, and prevention of attacks and
exacerbation factors; the danger of smoking was also emphasized. The second
group session, presented by a pharmacist, focused on asthma drugs and their
use. The third group session, presented by a nurse, focused on recording peak
expiratory flow (PEF) and symptoms in a diary and the stepwise treatment plan.
The fourth group session, presented by a physiotherapist, was on breathing,
exercise, rest positions, and respiration. Patients then had one to two
individualized sessions with a nurse and one to two individual sessions with a
physiotherapist.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study was a randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up.
Spirometry was performed before randomization and at 12 months follow-up.
HRqoL was assessed using the following four approaches:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Extent of chest trouble in the last year;

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 140 patients participated, 78 of whom had asthma. Participants were
randomized to either an intervention group or a control group.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included FEV1 scores and scores on the four HRqoL areas.
Statistically significant differences were found in all four areas for asthma.
(COPD results are not reported in this summary.) Of the intervention group
participants, 84% reported their chest trouble had improved compared with 43%
of those in the control group. Only 19% of the intervention group participants
reported daily or weekly symptoms, compared with 64% in the control group. Six
percent of the intervention group participants and 41% of the control
participants reported nightly or weekly nighttime symptoms. After 1 year, 13%
of those in the intervention group reported an impact on daily life compared
with 38% in the control group. None of the intervention group answered they
had deteriorated during the follow-up year; 4 of 5 felt their condition had
improved. During the 12-month follow-up, the mean FEV1 increased by 112 among
participants receiving the intervention, whereas it fell by 83 in the control
group.

Lucas DO, Zimmer LO, Paul JE, Jones D, Slatko G, Liao W, Lashley J. Two-year
results of the Asthma self-management program: long-term impact on health care
services, cost, functional status, and productivity. Journal of Asthma
2001;38(4):321-330.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The intervention involved 16 health plans, clinics, and employer groups in a
classroom setting.

**Target Population:**  
Persons diagnosed with asthma aged 14 years and older were recruited from
various health plans, clinics, and employer groups.

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to assess the effectiveness of the Asthma Self-
Management Program (ASMP) as an education and behavioral change instrument.
ASMP is an eight-session course of 60-90 minutes each over 8 weeks with
instruction on the respiratory system, trigger avoidance, use of monitoring
techniques, peak flow meter and metered dose inhaler use, use of an asthma
journal to monitor breathing and self-care, and asthma medication. Print
materials used were "Asthma: A Patient Guide to Treatment" and a course
manual. A characteristic of the intervention was the development and
assessment of participant skills. Skill performance was promoted by take-home
exercises to allow participants to apply newly learned skills. Repeated
performance of self-management behavior allowed for skill mastery and improved
confidence in participants' capacity to take on desired behaviors.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The evaluation was one-group, pre-post design, with a comparison of responses
to questionnaire items before and after program participation. Self
administered telephone surveys at 3 and 6 months and mailed surveys at 12 and
24 months following the intervention were used to assess asthma control
behaviors, daily functioning, quality of life, and utilization of health care
services.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 213 people enrolled in the program. Only 137 participants attended
5 or more of the 8 weekly sessions. Data were provided by 110 individuals at
baseline, 1 year, and 2 years, and were included in the analysis.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, functioning,
productivity, and health care utilization. Increases in self-efficacy scores
after one year were statistically significant over baseline scores.
Statistically significant improvements in functioning (e.g., emotional well-
being, daily work, social activities, and physical activities) were observed 1
and 2 years after program completion. Nighttime waking because of asthma in
the past week decreased from 1.3 to 0.5, work and school days missed in 12
months decreased from 2.9 to 1.5, and the number of days with reduction in
productivity at work and school fell from 18.7 to 3.2 after 2 years. From
baseline to 2 years, hospitalizations decreased by 64%, emergency department
visits decreased by 86%, and urgent-care visits decreased more than 50%. A
return on investment was calculated at 254%.

can have positive results in an Asian population with low socioeconomic and
cultural status where the influence of herbal medicine is still widespread.
All patients attended a 2-hour education session in groups of 10 run by a
trained asthma education nursing staff. The course addressed the nature of
asthma, potential triggers, medications available and their use, and proper
inhaler techniques. Participants demonstrated their inhaler techniques and
were corrected as necessary. Patients were given a credit-card-sized
instruction pamphlet regarding self-management steps and information regarding
when to seek help based on peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates and daily
recording of asthma symptoms. At intervals of 4-12 weeks, the program was
reinforced by video sessions during clinic attendance. Inhaler use and PEF
were also checked by the same nurses, and the self-management plan was
reviewed.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study utilized a pre-post pilot design. Several characteristics were
measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year post-intervention to assess the
program efficacy. PEF and forced expiratory volume at 1 minute (FEV1) were
recorded, inhaler technique was assessed by the same specialist, and a 28-item
questionnaire was completed to assess knowledge of asthma pathophysiology,
medication, self-management, and self-rating of asthma control over the past 6
months, at baseline, and at 1 year. Outcome measures included
hospitalizations, visits to family physicians, emergency department (ED)
attendance, and days off work or school.

**Sample Size:**  
The study sample included 192 Chinese adults living in Hong Kong, China; 75
were male, and 117 were female. All required the use of inhaled steroids.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Statistically significant improvements were shown in FEV1 (63.6 ± 20.6% of
predicted values at baseline to 68.6 ± 22.8% at one year) and PEF (64.6 ±
23.0% of predicted values at baseline to 76.8 ± 24.5%) at 1 year.
Statistically significant improvements also occurred in asthma knowledge,
inhaler technique, and patients' self-rating of their asthma. At the 1-year
follow-up, hospitalizations decreased from 0.71 at baseline to 0.45, average
ED visits decreased from 1.34 to 0.62, physician visits decreased from 7.26 to
2.98, and days off from work or school decreased from 5.07 to 3.05. Courses of
steroids also fell from 2.02 at baseline to 1.37 in the same time period.

Ignacio-Garcia JM, Gonzalez-Santos P. Asthma self-management education program
by home monitoring of peak expiratory flow. American Journal of Respiratory
Critical Care Medicine 1995;151:353.

**Intervention Setting:**  
An outpatient asthma clinic of a 210-bed hospital in Ronda, Malaga, Spain

**Target Population:**  
Adults with chronic asthma who had experienced at least one asthma
exacerbation requiring hospital care in the previous year

**Program Description:**  
The study was designed to asses the impact of an asthma self-management
education program previously found to be effective in a controlled trial
(Ignacio-Garcia and Gonzalez-Santos paper referenced above) coupled with
educational reinforcement, on the outcome of adult asthma patients 3 years
after the intervention. The initial assessment included a complete medical
history, physical examination, and spirometry. Researchers tailored medical
regimens to each patient's asthma pattern. Written therapeutic schedules were
provided to each patient. Emphasis was placed on explaining the inhaler
technique and the correct use of devices. Patients received information about
general concepts of asthma and its management, triggering factors, and ways to
avoid them, and they were taught to measure their peak expiratory flow rate
with a peak flow meter. Patients were instructed to measure their peak flow
twice a day just before using the inhalers. They also received diary cards to
record symptoms and the need for short-acting B2-agonists. During the second
visit, 1 month after the initial assessment, the clinician checked inhaler
technique, effective use of peak flow meters, compliance with patient's diary
card, need for B2-agonists, and environmental triggers and ways to avoid them.
Further education was provided as needed, and modifications to each patient's
regimen were discussed with him/her. Ongoing education was provided as written
information about the use and value of drugs and recognition and appropriate
management of acute exacerbations. During follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12, 24,
and 36 months, the program and the patient's behavior was reviewed, and
drawbacks and decisions regarding treatment were discussed. Educational
reinforcement was provided at all visits and written self-action plans were
delivered to patients when their treatment was modified.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A pre-post study of consecutive patients was utilized.

**Sample Size:**  
Sixty-three patients aged 14-65 years whose asthma had been diagnosed at least
2 years before acceptance into the program participated in the study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included days lost from work or school, unscheduled general
practitioner visits, emergency department visits either to the primary care
center or to the acute-care hospital, hospital admissions, and asthma-related
sleep disruptions. Morbidity data from the year before enrollment was compared
with the results obtained at 1, 2, and 3 years after the program was
completed. Comparison of data showed statistically significant decreases in
mean number of days off work or school from 38 (year before intervention) to
15 (after 1 year) to 6 (after 2 years) and 4.25 (after 3 years). Primary care
visits for the same periods decreased significantly from the mean of 6.78 in
the year before to the intervention to 2.44 at 1 year, to 1.49 at 2 years, and
1.29 at 3 years. Emergency visits for primary care over the 4 years fell from
a mean of 1.67 before the intervention to 0.43, 0.24, and 0.25 in the
succeeding 3 years. Nocturnal wakening over this same 4-year period fell
dramatically from a preintervention mean average of 120, to 35, to 20, and 16
over the following 3 years. All patients had inhaled steroids prescribed
before and at the end of the study. The percentage of patients using oral
steroids decreased significantly at the end of the study from 22% to 11%.

**Materials available:**  
Educational materials and handouts for the educational program are in Spanish.

K, Besse F, Marty S, Uldry C, Assal JP. Bronchial asthma and self-management
education: Implementation of guidelines by an interdisciplinary program in a
health network. Swiss Medical Weekly 2002;132:92-7.

**Intervention Setting:**  
University hospital outpatient clinic in Switzerland

**Target Population:**  
Adults aged 17 years and older whose forced expiratory volume in 1 second, was
⊃3; 50% of predicted value with > 20% reversibility after bronchodilators

**Program Description:**  
The study was undertaken to promote an interdisciplinary approach to asthma
treatment combined with a self-management education (SME) program and then
measuring the impact. A panel of pneumonologists and nursing staff in
conjunction with communication professionals produced an SME booklet in two
languages, French and German. The health network team members participating in
the study, i.e., primary care physicians, medical specialists, pharmacists,
and nursing staff, attended a 12-hour interdisciplinary seminar to prepare
them to implement the intervention. Topics included active education strategy,
management of an interdisciplinary team, the role of the various players,
patient education strategy, knowledge of asthma, and asthma management using
current guidelines. The educational intervention for the patients included
basic information about asthma physiopathology, precipitating factors and
measures for preventing bronchial asthma, basic information about drugs,
inhalation techniques, peak flow measurement, use of a personalized plan of
action for preventing and managing asthma attacks, and other topics considered
necessary by the patient's medical care provider. Each patient received a
personal follow-up diary with written, individualized objectives. After the
education, a physician conducted follow-ups with each participant at 3, 6, 9,
and 12 months in conjunction with the physiotherapist responsible for data
collection.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A pre-post methodology was utilized.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 66 patients participated in this study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included asthma-related hospital stays, emergency
consultations, and missed workdays over a 1 year. Total days hospitalized
decreased from 232 days before the intervention to 68 days in the year after
the intervention, and the total number of emergency consultations decreased
from 314 to 128 for the corresponding periods. Thirty-nine percent of patients
had missed workdays before to the intervention compared with 14% the following
year. Total lost workdays decreased from 652 days before the intervention to
126 days after the intervention. Overall, the intervention resulted in a
health cost saving of (Swiss francs) CHF 202,510 in terms of missed work and
CHF 131,200 in terms of days in the hospital, for a total of CHF 333,710.
Costs saved per patient were CHF 5,056 per year.

**Information about materials:**  
The teaching program used in this study was adapted from the Quebec teaching
program on asthma. (Boulet LP. L'Asthma: Notions de Base, Education,
Intervention. Les Presses de l'Universite Laval 1997, Quebec, Canada:
