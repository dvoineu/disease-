The Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD) strives to protect the nation
from viruses and bacteria spread by mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas. Vector-borne
pathogens are spread to people and animals primarily through the bite of an
infected mosquito, tick, or flea. Only a few mosquito-borne viruses can be
prevented with vaccines. In most cases, people need to protect themselves from
mosquito, tick, and flea bites to prevent infection.
