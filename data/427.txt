## Summary

Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. These curves are
often S- or C-shaped. Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early
teens, when children grow fast. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. It
can run in families. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven
shoulders and hips. Sometimes it is easy to notice, but not always.

Children may get screening for scoliosis at school or during a checkup. If it
looks like there is a problem, your doctor will use your medical and family
history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment
depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, how much curving
there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild
scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse.
Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery.
