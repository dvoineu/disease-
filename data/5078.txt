# Using your shoulder after replacement surgery

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

You had shoulder replacement surgery to replace the bones of your shoulder
joint with artificial parts. The parts include a stem made of metal and a
metal ball that fits on the top of the stem. A plastic piece is used as the
new surface of the shoulder blade.

Now that you are home you will need to know how to protect your shoulder as it
heals.

## What to Expect at Home

You will need to wear a sling for the first 6 weeks after surgery. You may
want to wear the sling for extra support or protection after that.

## Self-care

Rest your shoulder and elbow on a rolled up towel or small pillow when lying
down. This helps prevent damage to your shoulder from the stretching of the
muscles or tendons. You will need to keep doing this for 6 to 8 weeks after
your surgery, even when wearing a sling.

Your surgeon or physical therapist may teach you pendulum exercises to do at
home for 4 to 6 weeks. To do these exercises:

    * Lean over and support your weight with your good arm on a counter or table.
    * Hang your arm that had surgery down.
    * Very carefully and slowly swing your loose arm around in circles. 

Your surgeon or physical therapist will also teach you safe ways to move your
arm and shoulder:

    * DO NOT try to lift or move your shoulder without supporting it with your good arm or having someone else support it. Your surgeon or therapist will tell you when it is OK to lift or move your shoulder without this support.
    * Use your other (good) arm to move the arm that had surgery. Move it only as far as your doctor or physical therapist tells you is OK. 

These exercises and movements may be hard but they will get easier over time.
It is very important to do these as your surgeon or therapist showed you.
Doing these exercises will help your shoulder get better faster. They will
help you be more active after you recover.

Activities and movements you should try to avoid are:

    * Reaching or using your shoulder a lot
    * Lifting objects heavier than a cup of coffee
    * Supporting your body weight with your hand on the side you had surgery
    * Making sudden jerking movements 

Wear the sling all the time unless your surgeon says you do not have to.

After 4 to 6 weeks, your surgeon or physical therapist will show you other
exercises to stretch your shoulder and gain more movement in your joint.

 **Returning to sports and other activities**

Ask your surgeon which sports and other activities are OK for you after you
recover.

Always think about how to safely use your shoulder before you move or start an
activity. To protect your new shoulder avoid:

    * Activities that require doing the same movement over and over again with your shoulder, such as weight lifting.
    * Jamming or pounding activities, such as hammering.
    * Impact sports, such as boxing or football.
    * Any physical activities that need quick stop-start motions or twisting. 

You will probably not be able to drive for at least 4 to 6 weeks after
surgery. You should not drive when you are taking narcotics. Your surgeon or
physical therapist will tell you when driving is OK.

## When to Call the Doctor

Call your surgeon or nurse if you have any of the following:

    * Bleeding that soaks through your dressing and does not stop when you place pressure over the area
    * Pain that does not go away when you take your pain medicine
    * Swelling in your arm
    * Your hand or fingers are darker in color or feel cool to the touch
    * Redness, pain, swelling, or a yellowish discharge from the wound
    * Fever of 101Â°F (38.3Â°C) or higher
    * Shortness of breath or chest pain
    * Your new shoulder joint does not feel secure and feels like it is moving around
