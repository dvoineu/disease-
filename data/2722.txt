Congenital syphilis is a severe, disabling, and often life-threatening
infection seen in infants. A pregnant mother who has syphilis can spread the
disease through the placenta to the unborn infant.

## Causes

Congenital syphilis is caused by the bacteria _Treponema pallidum_ , which is
passed from mother to child during fetal development or at birth. Nearly one
half of all children infected with syphilis while they are in the womb die
shortly before or after birth.

Despite the fact that this disease can be cured with antibiotics if caught
early, rising rates of syphilis among pregnant women in the United States have
increased the number of infants born with congenital syphilis.

## Symptoms

Most babies who are infected before birth appear normal. Over time, symptoms
may develop. In babies younger than 2 years old, symptoms may include:

    * Enlarged liver and/or spleen (mass in belly)
    * Failure to gain weight or failure to thrive (including prior to birth, with low birthweight)
    * Fever
    * Irritability
    * Irritation and cracking of skin around the mouth, genitals, and anus
    * Rash starting as small blisters, especially on the palms and soles, and later changing to copper-colored, flat or bumpy rash
    * Skeletal (bone) abnormalities
    * Not able to move a painful arm or leg
    * Watery fluid from the noseÂ 

Symptoms in older infants and young children may include:

    * Abnormal notched and peg-shaped teeth, called Hutchinson teeth
    * Bone pain
    * Blindness
    * Clouding of the cornea (the covering of the eyeball)
    * Decreased hearing or deafness
    * Deformity of the nose with flattened nasal bridge (saddle nose)
    * Gray, mucus-like patches around the anus and vagina
    * Joint swelling
    * Saber shins (bone problem of the lower leg)
    * Scarring of the skin around the mouth, genitals, and anus

## Exams and Tests

If the infection is suspected at the time of birth, the placenta will be
examined for signs of syphilis. A physical examination of the infant may show
signs of liver and spleen swelling and bone inflammation.

A routine blood test for syphilis is done during pregnancy. The mother may
receive the following blood tests:

    * Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS)
    * Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)
    * Venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) 

An infant or child may have the following tests:

    * Bone x-ray
    * Dark-field examination to detect syphilis bacteria under a microscope 
    * Eye examination
    * Lumbar punctureÂ (spinal tap) â to remove spinal fluid for testing
    * Blood tests (similar to those listed above for the mother)

## Treatment

Penicillin is the drug of choice for treating this problem. It may be given by
IV or as a shot or injection. Other antibiotics may be used if the baby is
allergic to penicillin.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Many infants who were infected early in the pregnancy are stillborn. Treatment
of the expectant mother lowers the risk for congenital syphilis in the infant.
Babies who become infected when passing through the birth canal have a better
outlook than those who are infected earlier during pregnancy.

## Possible Complications

Health problems that can result if the baby isn't treated include:

    * Blindness
    * Deafness
    * Deformity of the face
    * Nervous system problems 

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if your baby has signs or symptoms of this
condition.

If you think that you may have syphilis and are pregnant (orÂ plan to getÂ
pregnant), call your provider right away.

## Prevention

Safer sexual practices help prevent the spread of syphilis. If you suspect you
have a sexually transmitted disease such as syphilis, seek medical attention
right away to avoid complications like infecting your baby during pregnancy or
birth.

Prenatal care is very important. Routine blood tests for syphilis are done
during pregnancy. These help identify infected mothers so they can be treated
to reduce the risks to the infant and themselves. Infants born to infected
mothers who received proper antibiotic treatment during pregnancy are at
minimal risk for congenital syphilis.

## Alternative Names

Fetal syphilis
