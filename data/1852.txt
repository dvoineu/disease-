## Summary

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system. It mainly
affects how nerve cells form and grow. It causes tumors to grow on nerves. You
can get neurofibromatosis from your parents, or it can happen because of a
mutation (change) in your genes. Once you have it, you can pass it along to
your children. Usually the tumors are benign, but sometimes they can become
cancerous.

There are three types of neurofibromatosis:

    * Type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes and deformed bones. It usually starts in childhood. Sometimes the symptoms are present at birth.
    * Type 2 (NF2) causes hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and poor balance. Symptoms often start in the teen years.
    * Schwannomatosis causes intense pain. It is the rarest type.

Doctors diagnose the different types based on the symptoms. Genetic testing is
also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. There is no cure. Treatment can help
control symptoms. Depending on the type of disease and how serious it is,
treatment may include surgery to remove tumors, radiation therapy, and
medicines.
