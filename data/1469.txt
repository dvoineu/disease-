Lice are parasitic insects that can be found on people's heads and bodies,
including the pubic area. Human lice survive by feeding on human blood. Lice
found on each area of the body are different from each other. The three types
of lice that live on humans are

Only the body louse is known to spread disease.

Lice infestations (pediculosis and pthiriasis) are spread most commonly by
close person-to-person contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role
in the transmission of human lice. Lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or
fly. Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available for
treatment of lice infestations.

### Head Lice

![](/parasites/images/lice/head_louse_home.gif)

Adult head lice are 2.1-3.3 mm in length. Head lice infest the head and neck
and attach their eggs to the base of the hair shaft. Lice move by crawling;
they cannot hop or fly.

### Body Lice

![](/parasites/images/lice/body_louse_home.gif)

Adult body lice are 2.3-3.6 mm in length. Body lice live and lay eggs on
clothing and only move to the skin to feed.

### Pubic

![](/parasites/images/lice/pubic_louse_home.gif)

Adult pubic lice are 1.1-1.8 mm in length. Pubic lice typically are found
attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair
elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache,
chest, armpits, etc.).
