#### University Agreement

If you are a university with students who may be interested in finding a
volunteer opportunity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
voluntary positions may be available through the Student Work Experience
Program (SWEP). In order for students at your university to participate in
SWEP, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) is required between your school and
CDC. If your university already has an MOU established with CDC, HR may send
out announcements regarding open volunteer positions and/or distribute
information to university career development/services. For information on how
to establish an MOU, contact Human Resources at HRCS@cdc.gov or 770-488-1725.

## Thurgood Marshall College Foundation/CDC Student Ambassador Program and
Internship

The Thurgood Marshall College Foundation/CDC Ambassador and Internship Program
is designed to increase interest in public health careers among minority
students, and to increase minority representation in mission critical
occupations at CDC and the public health workforce. The program seeks to
promote CDC as a preferred employer. Student ambassadors work at their
campuses and in their communities to actively promote public service and
public health among their peers as a means of making a positive difference.
The ambassadors promote public health initiatives on campus and in the
community, and build relationships between faculty and student groups.
