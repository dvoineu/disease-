## Summary

Is it hard for your child to sit still? Does your child act without thinking
first? Does your child start but not finish things? If so, your child may have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of
these behaviors at times, but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes
problems in school, at home and in social situations.

ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American
children.

The main features of ADHD are

    * Inattention
    * Hyperactivity
    * Impulsivity

No one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families, so
genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.

A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for
sure if your child has ADHD. Treatment may include medicine to control
symptoms, therapy, or both. Structure at home and at school is important.
Parent training may also help.
