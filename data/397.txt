## Summary

We all need clean water. People need it to grow crops and to operate
factories, and for drinking and recreation. Fish and wildlife depend on it to
survive.

Many different pollutants can harm our rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans. The
three most common are soil, nutrients, and bacteria. Rain washes soil into
streams and rivers. The soil can kill tiny animals and fish eggs. It can clog
the gills of fish and block light, causing plants to die. Nutrients, often
from fertilizers, cause problems in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. Nitrogen and
phosphorus make algae grow and can turn water green. Bacteria, often from
sewage spills, can pollute fresh or salt water.

You can help protect your water supply:

    * Don't pour household products such as cleansers, beauty products, medicines, auto fluids, paint, and lawn care products down the drain. Take them to a hazardous waste collection site.
    * Throw away excess household grease (meat fats, lard, cooking oil, shortening, butter, margarine, etc.) diapers, condoms, and personal hygiene products in the garbage can.
    * Clean up after your pets. Pet waste contains nutrients and germs.
