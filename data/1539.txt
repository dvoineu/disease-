The NBDPS is one of the largest studies on birth defects ever undertaken in
the United States. This study has made key contributions toward understanding
the causes of birth defects and identifying potential risks for having a baby
with a birth defect. Learn more about the study.

### About NBDPS

![NBDPS](/ncbddd/birthdefects/images/nbdps_sm.jpg)

The NBDPS is one of the largest studies on the causes of birth defects in the
United States. NBDPS researchers study information from babies born between
1997 and 2011. Over the course of 14 years of interviews, 43,000 women from 10
states took part in the study. Interviewing mothers of babies in the study
stopped in March 2013, but researchers will continue to analyze this rich
source of information on birth defects.

NBDPS has made key contributions toward understanding the risk of having a
baby with a birth defect when specific medications are used just before and
during pregnancy. Data from NBDPS have demonstrated that mothers who are obese
have a much higher risk for having a baby with a number of different major
birth defects. The study has also confirmed results from previous studies that
found that women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy have a higher risk of
having a baby with a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. Understanding the risks
and causes of birth defects can help us prevent them. This study provides
important clues to help us in our journey to ensure that every child is born
in the best possible health.

### Notable NBDPS Findings

To date, more than 200 scientific papers have been published using data from
NBDPS. Some examples of important findings:

**Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Oral Clefts** - Polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are chemicals formed during the burning of coal, oil, gas,
garbage, or from smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, or from charbroiling
meat. There are many ways to come in contact with PAHs at home or at work.
NBDPS researchers looked for evidence of a link between PAHs in a woman's
workplace and oral clefts (clefts of the lip and palate) in their babies.

Among women interviewed for the NBDPS, researchers found that it was not very
common for women to work in places with PAHs. PAH exposure occurred most often
among women working in food preparation and serving. Pregnant women who worked
in places with any PAHs were more likely to have babies with cleft lip with or
without a cleft palate. Pregnant women who worked in places with higher PAH
levels were even more likely to have babies with cleft lip than women who
worked in areas with lower PAH levels. Since this was the first study to show
this link, more research is needed to understand it fully.

**Butalbital Use and Birth Defects**  
Butalbital (byoo-TAL-bi-tal) is an ingredient in some medicines (for example,
Fioricet®, Fiorinal®) prescribed for the treatment of migraine and tension-
type headaches. Little is known about the safety or risk of using butalbital
while pregnant. NBDPS researchers looked to see if there is a link between
butalbital use and birth defects.

Researchers found that butalbital use is rare among women in NBDPS.
Researchers also found a link between using butalbital while pregnant and
certain congenital heart defects . The heart defects in the study with this
link include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve stenosis, and atrial septal
defects. This study is the first to show these links. More research is needed
to learn more about the risks and benefits of butalbital use among pregnant
women.

![Pregnant woman talking with her

**Antiherpetic Medication and Gastroschisis**  
Gastroschisis is a birth defect of the abdominal (belly) wall. The baby's
intestines are outside of the baby's body through a hole beside the belly
button. The causes of gastroschisis are not known, but it is thought that
exposures in early pregnancy might play a key role.

Herpes infections can occur during pregnancy, and to treat these infections
antiherpetic medicines are sometimes used. Researchers used NBDPS data to see
if antiherpetic medicine use in early pregnancy is linked to the risk of
gastroschisis. This study found that the risk of gastroschisis could be higher
in children born to women with herpes infection who used antiherpetic
medicine. More research is needed to determine the risks of herpes and
antiherpetic medications in pregnancy.

**Genetics and Congenital Heart Defects**  
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common type of birth defect,
affecting about one in every 100 babies born in the United States. Scientists
are working hard to learn the causes of CHDs. Most CHDs are due to a complex
relationship among environment, lifestyle, and genetic factors.

Using the genetic samples that NBDPS families provided, NBDPS researchers
identified changes (sometimes called variants) in several genes that were
linked with CHDs. Variants in four genes were found to increase the risk of
heart defects. More research is needed to understand the functions of these
genes and to confirm the study findings among different groups. This study is
one of the first in NBDPS to study genes from babies and their mothers.

![Pregnant woman taking her temperature with a

**Fever in Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Defects**  
Fever in early pregnancy is common. It is reported by 5% to 10% of women
during the first trimester. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most
common birth defect. NBDPS researchers looked to see if there is a link
between fever during pregnancy and CHDs.

Among mothers of a baby without a birth defect, one out of 13 had a fever in
early pregnancy. For mothers of a baby with a CHD, about one in 12 had a fever
in early pregnancy. Researchers found that the risk for CHDs was higher if the
fever was from a urinary tract infection or pelvic inflammatory disease than
if it was from a respiratory, flu-like disease. The increased risk was seen
for certain CHD types, such as heterotaxy and some obstructive heart defects.
Results of this study suggest the risk for these heart defects might be lower
in women who were taking multivitamins before their pregnancy.

**Air Pollution and Congenital Heart Defects**  
Many pregnant women, especially those who live in urban areas, are exposed to
different air pollutants. Although the Environmental Protection Agency sets
air quality standards to limit the amount of pollution in our air, we still do
not know whether the amounts of pollution women are exposed to can affect
their unborn babies.

NBDPS researchers found that higher exposure to air pollutants related to car
traffic, specifically nitrogen dioxide, was more common among mothers of
babies born with certain types of congenital heart defects (CHDs). More
research is needed to learn what levels of air pollution affect an unborn
baby.

![A pulse oximetry test](/ncbddd/birthdefects/images/pulse-oximetry.jpg)

**The Potential Impact of Newborn Pulse Oximetry Screening**  
In the United States, about 7,200 babies born each year have critical
congenital heart disease, also known as CCHD. CCHDs are the most serious types
of congenital heart defects (CHDs). CCHDs often lead to low levels of oxygen
in a newborn. A low oxygen level in a baby can be found by testing oxygen
levels 24 hours after birth.

NBDPS researchers found that about 30% of the babies with CCHDs were diagnosed
more than three days after birth. The percentage of babies with more than
three days delay in diagnosis varied based on CCHD type--ranging from about 8%
for babies with pulmonary atresia to 62% for babies with coarctation of the
aorta. If these babies had been tested for CCHD within 24-48 hours of birth,
as is now mandated in many state newborn screening programs, some of them
might have been diagnosed sooner, leading to earlier treatment.

**Risk Factors for Choanal Atresia in the NBDPS**  
Choanal atresia is a narrowing of the nasal airway and can cause severe
breathing problems in newborns. It is one of the leading causes of nasal
surgery. Choanal atresia is rare, and not much is known about its risk
factors. NBDPS researchers looked for reasons that might increase the risk for
having a baby with choanal atresia.

Researchers found that the risk of choanal atresia was higher when women
smoked cigarettes, had three or more cups of coffee with caffeine every day,
or used thyroid medications early in their pregnancy. This study is one of the
first to look at risk factors for choanal atresia, so more research is needed
to confirm these findings.

**Participation in the Genetic Component of NBDPS**  
Most women (63%) who finished an NBDPS phone interview also gave NBDPS genetic
samples by providing swabs of their cheek cells. NBDPS researchers found that
taking part in the genetics part of the study differed by Center. The
participation ranged from 50% to 74% across different sites.

Participation also differed by race/ethnicity. Among white and Hispanic women,
those with a higher education and had a baby with a birth defect were more
likely to complete the cheek cell collection than women of other races. Among
all racial/ethnic groups, an extra $20 incentive and a shorter time between
the baby's due date and the phone interview were linked with women being more
likely to participate. Researchers can use this feedback to increase
participation in similar studies in the future.
