# Water-related Environmental Tracking

Environmental Public Health Tracking is the collection of information on
environmental hazards (for example, chemicals, microbes), exposures to those
hazards (for example, through water, air), and related health effects. The
goal of a tracking system is to provide information that can be used to
prevent and control environmentally-related diseases. Listed below are
tracking systems and databases that collect data on water quality measures and
contaminants.

For decades, the U.S. has faced a gap in knowing how environmental
contaminants affect people's health. CDC is working to close this gap by
improving surveillance through the National Environmental Public Health
Tracking Network. The Tracking Network includes environment and health data
from some national sources as well as 24 state and city tracking programs.
Explore the Tracking Network's Community Water content for information and
data about the levels of several contaminants that can be found in drinking
water.

Summary of selected U.S. Geological Survey data on domestic well water quality for the Centers for Disease Control's National Environmental Health Tracking Program.External Scientific Investigations Report. 2007;SIR2007-5213.  
USGS data were used to assess domestic well water quality using 11
contaminants (trace elements, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds) of
potential human health concern. Data were analyzed for 16 States funded by
CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program. Only data from
domestic-water supplies were used in this summary because samples from these
wells are most relevant to human exposure for the targeted population. The
concentrations of the 11 contaminants were compared to EPA human-health
benchmarks. Using NAWQA and USGS state data, the geographic distribution of
the contaminants were mapped for the 16 States. Radon, arsenic, manganese,
nitrate, strontium, and uranium had the largest percentages of samples with
concentrations greater than their human-health benchmarks. In contrast,
organic compounds (pesticides and volatile organic compounds) had the lowest
percentages of samples.

A survey of the quality of water drawn from domestic wells in nine midwest states. Cdc-pdf[PDF - 32 pages] 1998.  
Domestic wells, cisterns, or springs supply drinking water to eighteen percent
of the households in the nine upper midwestern states. Many of these wells
were in areas of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins that were flooded
during the 1993 midwest flood. After the flood waters receded, many state and
county sanitarians reported that water samples collected from domestic wells
in the flooded river basins contained coliform bacteria. A survey was
initiated in 1994 to assess the presence of bacteria and chemicals in water
drawn from 5520 households with domestic wells in the states that were
severely affected by the flood. Coliform bacteria, _E. coli_ , nitrate, and
atrazine were found in many of the water samples collected from midwestern
households with a domestic well. Most of the water samples with these
pollutants were drawn from dug or bored wells that were old and shallow and
had a large-diameter brick or concrete casing. Wells with a pitless adapter or
backflow device had a lower contamination rate. A cracked casing or opening in
the well greatly increased the risk for contamination. Samples from wells
within 100 feet from septic tanks or cisterns; or had pesticides, manure, or
fertilizer applied within 100 feet of the well; or down gradient from a
pollutant source, had a higher contamination rate.
