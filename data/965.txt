The number of reported cases of congenital syphilis (CS) has increased every
year since 2012 in the United States. From 2012 to 2017, the CS rate increased
177% from 8.4 to 23.3 cases per 100,000 live births.1  CS prevention relies on
screening and treatment of pregnant women found to have syphilis. Many states'
laws require syphilis testing of pregnant women.  Thus, state policies
regarding prenatal syphilis screening may be one way to address rising CS
rates through increased screening.

This document includes the text of state laws requiring screening of pregnant
women for syphilis in the United States, as of December 2018.  These results
are based upon a 2018 peer reviewed articleexternal icon published in the
Maternal and Child Health Journal that analyzes these laws as of 2016; details
of the methods used in performing the legal analysis underlying these results
can be found in that article.2 This document expands upon that article through
an updated legal assessment as of 2018.  It also includes the text of the laws
underlying the analysis in order to facilitate a better understanding of these
policies.

### **AS § 18.15.150**  
§ 18.15.150. Taking of blood sample

Each licensed physician and in the absence of a licensed physician each
licensed graduate nurse who attends a pregnant woman for conditions relating
to the pregnancy during the period of gestation or at delivery shall take, or
have taken, a sample of the blood of the woman at the time of the woman's
first professional visit or within 10 days after the visit, unless the
serological test is contrary to the tenets or practice of the religious creed
of which the woman is an adherent. The blood specimen shall be submitted to an
approved laboratory or clinic for a standard serological test of syphilis. Any
other person permitted by law to attend pregnant women but not permitted by
law to take blood samples shall have a sample of blood taken by a licensed
physician, or on order of a licensed physician, and shall submit the sample to
an approved laboratory or clinic for a standard serological test for syphilis.

### **AS § 18.15.180**  
§ 18.15.180. Penalty

A licensed physician or licensed nurse attending a pregnant woman during the
period of gestation or at delivery, or a representative of a laboratory or
clinic who violates AS 18.15.150 - 18.15.180 is guilty of a misdemeanor and,
upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of not more than $500. However, a
person attending a pregnant woman during the period of gestation or at
delivery, who requests the specimen in accordance with AS 18.15.150, and whose
request is refused, is not guilty of a misdemeanor.

### **AS § 18.15.160**  
§ 18.15.160. Test for syphilis

For the purposes of AS 18.15.150 - 18.15.180 a standard serological test is a
test for syphilis approved by the department and shall be performed in a
laboratory or clinic approved by the department. On request the laboratory
test required by AS 18.15.150 - 18.15.180 shall be performed without charge at
the laboratories of the department.

The board recommends that a certified direct-entry midwife make prenatal visits to a client every four weeks until the 28th week of gestation, every two weeks from the 29th through the 35th week of gestation, and weekly from the 36th week of gestation until birth. The midwife shall document a client's refusal of any required or recommended test or visit.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. At the initial prenatal visit, the certified direct-entry midwife shall recommend that the client undergo a physical examination as required in AS 08.65.140(1)to screen for health problems that could complicate the pregnancy or delivery and that includes a review of the laboratory studies required in (c) of this section. The certified direct-entry midwife shall obtain a signed written consent from the client reflecting the client's informed choice regarding the recommended physical examination and retain the consent in the client's record.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3.

During the third trimester, the certified direct-entry midwife shall ensure that the home-birth client is adequately prepared for a home-birth by discussing issues such as sanitation, facilities, adequate heat, availability of telephone and transportation, plans for emergency evacuation to a hospital, and the skills and equipment that the midwife will bring to the birth.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  11. A certified direct-entry midwife shall make a home visit three to five weeks before the estimated date of confinement to assess the physical environment, to determine whether the home-birth client has the necessary supplies, to prepare the family for the birth, and to instruct the family in correction of problems or deficiencies.

It shall be the duty of the local health authority in whose jurisdiction the case occurs to investigate the case to confirm the diagnosis by bacteriological examination and, if of Gonococcal origin, to determine if the attendant at delivery used prophylactic medication in the eyes of the infant.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. Due to the nature of the infection and its communicability, and inasmuch as Gonorrheal Ophthalmia is amenable to penicillin therapy; it shall be the duty of every physician to administer adequate penicillin therapy at once. It shall be the duty of every midwife attending such cases, or suspected cases, to refer all such cases to a licensed physician for treatment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. It shall be the duty of every physician to report, as soon as diagnosed, every case of sexually transmitted disease on the Confidential Case Report, as provided by the Department, or by utilizing the Toll Free Communicable Disease Reporting System, to the Sexually Transmitted Disease Program, Arkansas Department of Health.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. Whenever the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that any person is suffering from Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chancroid, Lymphogranuloma Venereum or Granuloma Inguinale in a communicable state, he is authorized to cause such person to be apprehended and detained for the necessary tests and examination, including an approved blood serologic test and other approved laboratory tests, to ascertain the existence of said disease or diseases: provided, that any evidence so acquired shall not be used against such person in any criminal prosecution.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. The Director may, when in the exercise of his discretion he believes that the public health requires it, commit any commercial prostitute, or other persons apprehended and examined and found afflicted with said diseases, or either of them who refuses or fails to take treatment adequate for the protection of the public health, to a hospital or other place in the State of Arkansas for such treatment even over the objection of the person so diseased and treated provided the commitment can be done without endangering the life of the patient.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  6. It shall be the duty of a physician on the occasion of the first visit to or by a person suffering from Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chancroid, Lymphogranuloma Venereum or Granuloma Inguinale to instruct said person in the precautions to be taken to prevent communication of the disease to others, and to inform him of the necessity of continued uninterrupted treatment until such adequate treatment has been administered.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  7. It shall be the duty of every physician to administer appropriate and adequate treatment to any individual regardless of age, sex, or race whom he has reasonable grounds to believe is suffering from Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chancroid, Lymphogranuloma Venereum or Granuloma Inguinale in a communicable state, to render the disease non-communicable to others for the protection of the public health. Likewise, it shall be the duty of every physician to treat, prophylactically or therapeutically, any individual regardless of age, sex or race whom he has reasonable grounds to believe has been exposed to a communicable case of Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chancroid, Lymphogranuloma Venereum or Granuloma Inguinale for the protection of the public health. Consent to the provision of medical and surgical care or services by a physician licensed to practice medicine in this State, when executed by a minor who is or believes himself to be afflicted with a sexually transmitted disease, shall be valid and binding as if the minor had achieved his majority.

The practitioner submitting the specimens for testing to a licensed laboratory shall state that these specimens are from a pregnant or postpartum woman.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  8. Practitioners required by law to prepare birth and stillbirth certificates shall document on the certificate if chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis infections or genital herpes or genital human papilloma virus were present and/or treated during this pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  9.

This Code section shall be known and may be cited as the "Georgia HIV/Syphilis Pregnancy Screening Act of 2015."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Every physician and health care provider who assumes responsibility for the prenatal care of a pregnant woman during gestation and at delivery shall be required to test such pregnant woman for HIV and syphilis except in cases where the woman refuses the testing. Additionally, every physician and health care provider who provides prenatal care of a pregnant woman during the third trimester of gestation shall offer to test such pregnant woman for HIV and syphilis at the time of first examination during that trimester or as soon as possible thereafter, regardless of whether such testing was performed during the first two trimesters of her pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. If at the time of delivery there is no written evidence that an HIV test or a syphilis test has been performed, the physician or other health care provider in attendance at the delivery shall order that a test for HIV, syphilis, or both be administered at the time of the delivery except in cases where the woman refuses the testing; provided, however, that if available documentation indicates that a test for HIV and syphilis was already performed during the third trimester of her pregnancy in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section, and the woman does not disclose when questioned any activities posing a risk for infection with HIV or syphilis occurring more recently than would have been detected by such test, the physician or health care provider in attendance at the delivery is not required to order such additional test.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. The woman shall be notified of the test to be conducted and shall have the opportunity to refuse the test. A pregnant woman shall submit to an HIV test and a syphilis test pursuant to this Code section unless she specifically refuses. If the woman tests positive for HIV or syphilis, counseling services provided by the Department of Public Health shall be made available to her and she shall be referred to appropriate medical care providers for herself and her child.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. If for any reason the pregnant woman is not tested for HIV and syphilis, that fact shall be recorded in the patient's records, which, if based upon the refusal of the patient, shall relieve the physician or other health care provider of any other responsibility under this Code section.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  6. The Department of Public Health shall be authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for the purpose of administering the requirements under this Code section.

Every pregnant woman who delivers a live born or stillborn baby and did not have the required blood specimens taken during gestation shall have a blood specimen taken as prescribed herein for a standard serologic test for syphilis.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. Every physician in this state providing prenatal care to a pregnant woman, or delivering or attending a woman just delivered, shall take or cause to be taken a venous blood specimen for submission to a clinical laboratory for a standard serologic test for syphilis as follows: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. A blood specimen shall be taken at the initial visit to the physician for prenatal care and a second blood specimen shall be taken during the third trimester of gestation. Provided, however, if the initial visit is in the third trimester, a blood specimen is not required.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. The temperature and humidity in the nurseries and in the delivery suite shall be maintained at a level best suited for the protection of mothers and infants as recommended by the Guidelines for Perinatal Care. Chilling of the neonate shall be avoided; a non-stable neonate shall, immediately after birth, be placed in a radiant heat source that is ready to receive the infant and that allows access for resuscitation efforts. The radiant heat source shall comply with the recommendations of the Guidelines for Perinatal Care. When the neonate has been stabilized, if the mother wishes to hold her newborn, a radiant heater or pre-warmed blankets shall be available to keep the neonate warm. Stable infants shall be placed, and remain, in direct skin-to-skin contact with their mother immediately after delivery to optimally support infant breastfeeding and to promote mother/infant bonding. Personnel shall be available who are trained to use the equipment to maintain a neutral thermal environment for the neonate. For general temperature and humidity requirements, see Section 250.2480(d)(1). In general, a temperature between 72 degrees and 76 degrees and relative humidity between 35% and 60% are acceptable.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Linens and Laundry: Linens shall be cleaned and disinfected in compliance with the Guidelines for Perinatal Care.

Sterilizing equipment, as required in Section 250.1090, shall be available. Sterilizing equipment may be provided in the obstetric department or in a central sterilizing unit, provided that flash sterilizing equipment or adequate sterile supplies and instruments are provided in the obstetric department.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. Accommodations and Facilities for Obstetric Patients 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. The hospital shall identify specific rooms and beds, adjacent when possible to other obstetric facilities, as obstetric rooms and beds. These rooms and beds shall be used exclusively for obstetric patients or for combined obstetric and clean gynecological service beds in accordance with Section 250.1820(g).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Patient rooms and beds that are adjacent to another nursing unit may be used for clean cases as part of the adjacent nursing unit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. Oxytocin shall be used for medical induction or stimulation of labor only when qualified personnel, determined by the hospital staff and administration, can attend the patient closely. Written policies and procedures shall be available to the team members assuming this responsibility. The following shall be included in these policies: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. An attending physician shall evaluate the patient for induction or stimulation, especially with regard to indications.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. The physician or other individuals starting the oxytocin shall be familiar with its effect and complications and be qualified to identify both maternal and fetal complications.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. A qualified physician shall be immediately available as is necessary to manage any complication effectively.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. During oxytocin administration, the fetal heart rate; the resting uterine tone; and the frequency, duration and intensity of contractions shall be monitored electronically and recorded. Maternal blood pressure and pulse shall be monitored and recorded at intervals comparable to the dosage regimen; that is, at 30 to 60 minute intervals, when the dosage is evaluated for maintenance, increase or decrease. Evidence of maternal and fetal surveillance shall be documented.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6. Identification of infants: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. While the neonate is still in the delivery room, the nurse in the delivery room shall prepare identical identification bands for both the mother and the neonate, as outlined in the hospital's policy. Wrist bands alone may be used; however, it is recommended that both wrist and ankle bands be used on the neonate. The hospital shall not use foot-printing and fingerprinting alone as methods of patient identification. The bands shall indicate the mother's admission number, the neonate's gender, the date and time of birth, and any other information required by hospital policy. Delivery room personnel shall review the bands prior to securing them on the mother and the neonate to ensure that the information on the bands is identical. The nurse in the delivery room shall securely fasten the bands on the neonate and the mother without delay as soon as he/she has verified the information on the identification bands. The birth records and identification bands shall be checked again before the neonate leaves the delivery room.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. If the condition of the neonate does not allow the placement of identification bands, the identification bands shall accompany the neonate and shall be attached as soon as possible, as outlined in the hospital's policy. Identification bands shall not be left unattached and unattended in the nursery.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3. When the neonate is taken to the nursery, both the delivery room nurse and the admitting nursery nurse shall check the neonate's identification bands and birth records, verify the gender of the neonate, and sign the neonate's medical record. The admitting nurse shall complete the bassinet card and attach it to the bassinet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4. When the neonate is taken to the mother, the nurse shall check the mother's and the neonate's identification bands, verify the gender of the neonate and verify that the information on the bands is identical.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      5. The umbilical cord (cords, with multiple births) shall be identified according to hospital policy (e.g., by the use of a different number of clamps) so that umbilical cord blood specimens are correctly labeled. All umbilical cord blood samples shall be labeled correctly with an indication that these are a sample of the neonate's umbilical cord blood and not the blood of the mother.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6. The hospital shall develop a newborn infant security system. This system shall include instructions to the mother regarding safety precautions designed to avoid abduction. Electronic sensor devices may be included as well.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7. Within one hour after delivery, ophthalmic ointment or drops containing tetracycline or erythromycin shall be instilled into the eyes of the newborn infant as a preventive against ophthalmia neonatorum. The eyes shall not be irrigated.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    8. A single parenteral dose of vitamin K-1, water soluble to 0.5-1.0 milligrams, shall be given to the infant, shortly after birth, but usually within the first hour after delivery, as a prophylaxis against hemorrhagic disorder in the first days of life.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    9. Each infant shall be given complete individual crib-side care. The use of a common bath table is prohibited. Scales shall be adequately protected to prevent cross-infection.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    10. Artificial feedings and formula changes shall not be instituted except by written order of the attending physician, pursuant to the requirements of the Hospital Infant Feeding Act.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    11. Facilities for drug services. See Section 250.2130(a).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    12. Newborn infants shall be transported from the delivery room to the nursery in a safe manner. Adequate support systems (heating, oxygen, suction) shall be incorporated into the transport units for infants (e.g., to x-ray). Chilling of the newborn and cross-infection shall be avoided. If travel is excessive and through other areas, special transport incubators may be required. The method of transporting infants from the nursery to the mothers shall be individual, safe and free from cross-infection hazards.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    13. The stay of the mother and the infant in the hospital after delivery shall be planned to allow the identification of problems and to reinforce instructions in preparation for the infant's care at home. The mother and infant shall be carefully observed for a sufficient period of time and assessed prior to discharge to ensure that their conditions are stable. Healthy infants shall be discharged from the hospital simultaneously with the mother, or to other persons authorized by the mother, if the mother remains in the hospital for an extended stay.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. The hospital shall submit an immediate report of the occurrence of a maternal death to the Department, in accordance with the Department's rules titled Maternal Death Review. Maternal death is the death of any woman dying of any cause whatsoever while pregnant or within one year after termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy at the time of the termination or the method by which it was terminated. A death shall be reported regardless of whether the death occurred in the obstetric department or any other section of the hospital, or whether the patient was delivered in the hospital where death occurred, or elsewhere.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. The filing of this report shall in no way preclude the necessity of filing a death certificate or of including the death on the Perinatal Activities Report.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. The hospital shall comply with the laws of the State and the rules of the Department in the preparation and filing of birth, death and fetal death certificates.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. Epidemic and communicable disease reporting 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. The hospital shall develop a protocol for the management and reporting of infections consistent with the Control of Communicable Diseases Code, the Perinatal HIV Prevention Act, Guidelines for Perinatal Care and Guidelines for Women's Health Care, and as approved by the infection control committee. These policies shall be known to obstetric and nursery personnel.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. The facility shall particularly address those infections specifically related to mothers and infants, including but not limited to, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus occurring in infants under 61 days of age, ophthalmia neonatorum, and perinatal hepatitis B infection.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  10. Infant Feeding Policy 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. For the purposes of this subsection (j): 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative means the voluntary program sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) that recognizes hospitals that meet certain evaluation criteria regarding the promotion of breastfeeding.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. Infant Nutrition Resource means breastfeeding education and infant formula safety and preparation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Infant Feeding Policy Required 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. Every hospital that provides birthing services must adopt an infant feeding policy that promotes breastfeeding. In developing the policy, a hospital shall consider guidance provided by the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. An infant feeding policy adopted under this Section shall include guidance on the use of formula for medically necessary supplementation, if preferred by the mother, or when exclusive breastfeeding is contraindicated for the mother or for the infant.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. Communication of Policy. A hospital shall routinely communicate the infant feeding policy to staff in the hospital's obstetric and neonatal areas, beginning with hospital staff orientation. The hospital shall also ensure that the policy and infant nutrition resources are posted in a conspicuous place in the hospital's obstetric or neonatal area or on the hospital's Internet or Intranet web site or on the Internet or Intranet web site of the health system of which the hospital is a part. The hospital shall make copies of the policy available to the Department upon request.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. Application of Policy. A hospital's infant feeding policy adopted under the Hospital Infant Feeding Act must apply to all mother-infant couplets in the hospital's obstetric and neonatal areas. (Sections 5 through 20 of the Hospital Infant Feeding Act)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  11.

Pursuant to the requirements of subsection (j), the hospital shall provide the mother with information regarding lactation, the nutritional benefits of breast milk, and lactation support organizations within the area. The hospital staff shall include, at a minimum, lactation support staff with certification or experience in lactation training. The lactation support staff shall attend continuing education in relation to lactation counseling and training, consistent with hospital policy. At least one lactation support staff shall be on duty at all times in the obstetric department.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Pursuant to the requirements of subsection (j), the hospital shall have a policy for the preparation of formula by hospital staff when hospital-prepared formula is needed in place of commerciallyprepared formula. Adequate space, equipment and procedures for processing, handling and storing commercially-prepared formula shall be provided. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. All hospitals providing obstetric or pediatric services that prepare their own formula shall provide a well-ventilated and well-lighted formula room, which shall be adequately supervised and used exclusively for the preparation of formulas.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2.

### **KRS § 214.160**  
214.160 Blood specimen of pregnant women to be taken; laboratory test;
substance abuse tests of pregnant women and newborn infants; use of tests;
tests for presence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. Every physician and every other person legally permitted to engage in attendance upon a pregnant woman in this state shall take or cause to be taken from the woman a specimen of blood for serological test for syphilis as soon as he is engaged to attend the woman and has reasonable grounds for suspecting that pregnancy exists. If the woman is in labor at the time the diagnosis of pregnancy is made, which may make it inadvisable to obtain a blood specimen at that time, the specimen shall be obtained within ten (10) days after delivery. The specimen of blood shall be submitted to the laboratory of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services or a laboratory approved by the cabinet for the purpose of having made a serological test for syphilis. The test shall be of a type approved by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall, as often as necessary, publish a list of the five (5) most frequently abused substances, including alcohol, by pregnant women in the Commonwealth. Any physician and any other person legally permitted to engage in attendance upon a pregnant woman in this state may perform a screening for alcohol or substance dependency or abuse, including a comprehensive history of such behavior. Any physician may administer a toxicology test to a pregnant woman under the physician's care within eight (8) hours after delivery to determine whether there is evidence that she has ingested alcohol, a controlled substance, or a substance identified on the list provided by the cabinet, or if the woman has obstetrical complications that are a medical indication of possible use of any such substance for a nonmedical purpose.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. Any physician or person legally permitted to engage in attendance upon a pregnant woman may administer to each newborn infant born under that person's care a toxicology test to determine whether there is evidence of prenatal exposure to alcohol, a controlled substance, or a substance identified on the list provided by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, if the attending person has reason to believe, based on a medical assessment of the mother or the infant, that the mother used any such substance for a nonmedical purpose during the pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. The circumstances surrounding any positive toxicology finding shall be evaluated by the attending person to determine if abuse or neglect of the infant, as defined under KRS 600.020(1), has occurred and whether investigation by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services is necessary.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. No prenatal screening for alcohol or other substance abuse or positive toxicology finding shall be used as prosecutorial evidence.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  6. No person shall conduct or cause to be conducted any toxicological test pursuant to this section on any pregnant woman without first informing the pregnant woman of the purpose of the test.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  7. Every physician or other person legally permitted to engage in attendance upon a pregnant woman in the Commonwealth shall take or cause to be taken from the woman a specimen of blood which shall be submitted for the purpose of serologic testing for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen to a laboratory certified by the United States Department for Health and Human Services pursuant to Section 333 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 263a), as revised by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), Pub.L. 100-578.

Every physician who attends any pregnant woman for conditions relating to pregnancy during the period of gestation shall offer to take or to have taken a sample of her blood at the time of first examination or as soon as possible thereafter. Additionally, every physician who attends any pregnant woman for conditions relating to pregnancy during the third trimester of gestation shall offer to take or to have taken a sample of her blood at the time of first examination during such trimester or as soon as possible thereafter, regardless of whether such a sample was taken or offered during the first two trimesters of her pregnancy.

Every licensed physician, midwife, registered nurse and all persons who may undertake, in a professional way, the obstetrical and gynecological care of a pregnant woman in the state of Missouri shall, if the woman consents, take or cause to be taken a sample of venous blood of such woman at the time of the first prenatal examination, or not later than twenty days after the first prenatal examination, and subject such sample to an approved and standard serological test for syphilis, an approved serological test for hepatitis B and such other treatable diseases and metabolic disorders as are prescribed by the department of health and senior services. In any area of the state designated as a syphilis outbreak area by the department of health and senior services, if the mother consents, a sample of her venous blood shall be taken later in the course of pregnancy and at delivery for additional testing for syphilis as may be prescribed by the department. If a mother tests positive for hepatitis B, the physician or person who professionally undertakes the pediatric care of a newborn shall also administer the appropriate doses of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in accordance with the current recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). If the mother's hepatitis B status is unknown, the appropriate dose of hepatitis B vaccine shall be administered to the newborn in accordance with the current ACIP recommendations. If the mother consents, a sample of her venous blood shall be taken. If she tests positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) shall be administered to the newborn in accordance with the current ACIP recommendations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. The department of health and senior services shall, in consultation with the Missouri genetic disease advisory committee, make such rules pertaining to such tests as shall be dictated by accepted medical practice, and tests shall be of the types approved by the department of health and senior services. An approved and standard test for syphilis, hepatitis B, and other treatable diseases and metabolic disorders shall mean a test made in a laboratory approved by the department of health and senior services. No individual shall be denied testing by the department of health and senior services because of inability to pay.

Every physician, or other person authorized by law to practice obstetrics, who is attending a pregnant woman in the state for conditions relating to her pregnancy during the period of gestation or at delivery shall take or cause to be taken a sample of the blood of such woman at the time of the first examination and shall submit such sample to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis. Every other person permitted by law to attend pregnant women in the state, but not permitted by law to take blood samples, shall cause such a sample of the blood of such pregnant women to be taken by a physician, duly licensed to practice either medicine and surgery or obstetrics, or other person authorized by law to take such sample of blood and have such sample submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis. The results of all such laboratory tests shall be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services on standard forms prescribed and furnished by the department. For the purpose of this section, a standard serological test shall be a test for syphilis approved by the department and shall be made at a laboratory approved to make such tests by the department. Such laboratory tests, as are required by this section, shall be made on request at the Department of Health and Human Services Laboratory. A fee may be established by rule and regulation by the department to defray no more than the actual cost of such tests. Such fee shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the Health and Human Services Cash Fund. In reporting every birth and stillbirth, physicians and others required to make such reports shall state on the portion of the certificate entitled For Medical and Health Use Only whether a blood test for syphilis has been made upon a specimen of blood taken from the woman who bore the child for which a birth or stillbirth certificate is filed and the approximate date when the specimen was taken. No birth certificate shall show the result of such test. If no test was made, the reason shall be stated. The department shall provide the necessary clerical, printing, and other expenses in carrying out this section.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Every physician or other person authorized by law to practice obstetrics who is attending a pregnant woman in the state for conditions relating to her pregnancy during the period of gestation shall administer or cause to be administered a test of the pregnant woman's blood for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus infection unless the pregnant woman has given written informed consent that she does not want to be tested.

### 10 NYCRR 69-2.2*  
Section 69-2.2. Cord blood test for syphilis

Every responsible physician or birth attendant shall acquire from all infants
born, whether alive or dead after 22 weeks gestation, a sample of blood from
the umbilical cord and submit it to an approved laboratory for standard
serological tests for syphilis. If body blood from the mother is tested for
syphilis at the time of birth, the cord blood test requirement shall be waived
if the infant's body blood is tested after any positive test result of the
mother's blood.

*10 NYCRR 69-2.2 requires testing of the infant's cord blood at delivery.  While this law did not meet our coding criteria of being a test of the woman, it may nevertheless be relevant for purposes of congenital syphilis prevention.

3701.49 Duty in case physician is not in attendance

If any pregnant woman is attended during the period of gestation by any person
authorized to attend pregnant women, other than a licensed physician, but who
is not permitted to take test specimens, then such authorized person shall
notify immediately the health commissioner of the city or general health
district of the residence of such pregnant woman. The health commissioner
shall cause the test specimens to be taken of such pregnant woman for the
purpose of the standard syphilis and gonorrhea tests. Such taking of specimens
is subject to section 3701.50 of the Revised Code relating to the condition of
the pregnant woman.

### R.C. § 3701.50  
3701.50 Duty of physician to submit sample for tests; waiver

Every physician who attends any pregnant woman for conditions relating to
pregnancy during the period of gestation shall take specimens of such woman at
the time of first examination or within ten days thereof, and shall submit
such specimens to an approved laboratory for standard syphilis and gonorrhea
tests. If, in the opinion of the physician attending such woman, her condition
does not permit the taking of specimens for submission to an approved
laboratory, then no specimens shall be taken prior to delivery. If no
specimens are taken prior to delivery because of the woman's condition, then
such specimens shall be taken as soon after delivery as the physician deems it
advisable.

The health commissioner of the city or general health district, wherein any
person required to be tested for syphilis and gonorrhea under this section or
section 3701.49 of the Revised Code resides, may waive the requirements of
such sections if the commissioner is satisfied by written affidavit or other
written proof that the tests required are contrary to the tenets or practices
of the religious creed of which the person is an adherent, and that the public
health and welfare would not be injuriously affected by such waiver.

Every licensed physician and surgeon attending a pregnant or recently delivered woman for conditions relating to her pregnancy shall take or cause to be taken a sample of blood of the woman at the time of first examination or within 10 days thereafter. The blood sample shall be submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis. The provisions of this section do not apply to any female who objects thereto on the grounds that she is a bona fide member of a specified, well recognized religious organization whose teachings are contrary to the tests.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Every other person attending a pregnant or recently delivered woman, who is not permitted by law to take blood samples, shall within 10 days from the time of first attendance cause a sample of blood to be taken by a licensed physician. The blood sample shall be submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis.

For the purpose of this chapter, a "standard serological test" means a test for syphilis approved by the department and made at an approved laboratory.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5.

### W. Va. Code, § 16-4A-2  
§ 16-4A-2. Attending physician to obtain blood specimen

Every physician engaging in attendance upon a pregnant woman in West Virginia
shall, as soon as he or she is engaged to attend a woman and has reasonable
grounds for suspecting that pregnancy exists, acquaint such woman with the
provisions of this article and take or cause to be taken a specimen of blood
from such woman. This specimen shall be submitted to the state hygienic
laboratory or other laboratory approved by the state department of health as
required by the preceding section. If the woman is in a stage of gestation or
labor at the time that the diagnosis of pregnancy is made, which may make it
inadvisable to obtain the specimen, the specimen of blood shall be obtained
within ten days following delivery.

The state hygienic laboratory of the state health department shall perform the
serological tests required by law on all blood specimens taken from pregnant
women by physicians for examination. These tests shall be performed without
charge.

Upon request it shall be the duty of county and district health officers to
draw blood specimens from pregnant women for performing thereon a serologic
test for syphilis. This service shall be performed without charge.

In those areas where the services of a district or county health officer are
not available, the state health department shall assume the responsibility of
obtaining the required blood specimens without any charge to the pregnant
women.

### W. Va. Code, § 16-4A-5  
§ 16-4A-5. Offenses; penalty

Any physician or representative of a laboratory, making such examinations or
tests as are required by this article, or filing such birth or stillbirth
certificates, who shall knowingly misrepresent any of the facts called for in
the laboratory reports or birth or stillbirth certificate, or who otherwise
knowingly and wilfully[sic] shall violate any provision of this article, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a
fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars.
