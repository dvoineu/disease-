Also called: Arnold-Chiari Malformation

## Summary

Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum. The
cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance. With CM, brain
tissue extends into the spinal canal. It can happen when part of the skull is
too small, which pushes the brain tissue down. There are several types of CM.
One type often happens in children who have neural tube defects. Some types
cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. If you have symptoms, they may
include

    * Neck pain
    * Balance problems
    * Numbness or other abnormal feelings in the arms or legs
    * Dizziness
    * Vision problems
    * Difficulty swallowing
    * Poor hand coordination

Doctors diagnose CM using imaging tests. Medicines may ease some symptoms,
such as pain. Surgery is the only treatment available to correct or stop the
progression of nerve damage.
