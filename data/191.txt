## Summary

Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from
the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries
glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.

Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over
time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. Even
if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar
that is too low or too high. Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity,
and taking any medicines you need can help.

If you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers
in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times
each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C.
It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your
blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a
special diet.
