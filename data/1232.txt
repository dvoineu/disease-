Cancer Prevention During Early Life

media iconLow Resolution Video

This video invites you to learn about early life factors that contribute to a
person's lifetime cancer risk.

CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control sponsored a special issue in
the journal _Pediatrics_ external icon about factors from before birth through
early childhood that may affect a person's chance of getting cancer. The
authors of papers in this issue are experts from many different professions,
showing the importance of working together to address potential cancer causes
and risk factors.

Cancer is caused by a combination of factors over time. One of the papers
provides highlights from meetings with nationally recognized expertsexternal
icon about possible opportunities for cancer prevention early in life.
Research suggests that we can take steps today to protect the health of babies
and young children, and reduce their chances of getting cancer in the future.
