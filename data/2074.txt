## Summary

A coma is a deep state of unconsciousness. An individual in a coma is alive
but unable to move or respond to his or her environment. Coma may occur as a
complication of an underlying illness, or as a result of injuries, such as
brain injury.

A coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks. The outcome for coma depends on
the cause, severity, and site of the damage. People may come out of a coma
with physical, intellectual, and psychological problems. Some people may
remain in a coma for years or even decades. For those people, the most common
cause of death is infection, such as pneumonia.
