Online Technical Resource and Assistance Center (On-TRAC)

CDC plays a pivotal role in ensuring that state and local public health
systems are prepared for public health emergencies because of its unique
abilities to respond to infectious, occupational, or environmental incidents
that affect the public's health. CDC's Division of State and Local Readiness
funds preparedness activities to state and local public health systems through
the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement and
other funding. CDC also works to enhance medical countermeasure (MCM)
readiness nationwide to effectively respond to large public health emergencies
needing requiring life-saving medications medicines and medical supplies.
Through these resources, CDC helps public health departments improve their
ability to respond to a range of public health incidents and build better
prepared communities.
