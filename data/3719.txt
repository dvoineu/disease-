**PLEASE NOTE:** Effective immediately, the DPDx Team will require a **CDC
50.34 submission form** to be filled out and submitted with images for
diagnostic assistance in order to generate a formal, written laboratory
report.  This form must be submitted in a secure method to protect patient
information.  The CDC has a Sharefile system that should be used to submit the
form and images.  Please email the DPDx Team to request a one-time link to the
Sharefile server to submit a case for diagnostic assistance.  The Team will
include a CDC CSID number for the case in the subject line when they email the
link and that number will be used for any subsequent correspondence (when
necessary). The following steps describe the submission process:

If the electronic communication system of your institution is incompatible
with using the web-based CDC Sharefile, the form should be printed and faxed
to (country code +1) 404-718-4195, attn: DPDx Team, or submitted using your
institution's own web-based secure file sharing system, unless the CDC IT
Security Team detects that it does not meet HHS requirements for patient data
transfer. The images may be submitted by email; however the file name of the
images should not include patient identifiers.

To access the most recent form (CDC 50.34), please click **here**.

This assistance is free of charge (except for U.S. Federal agencies and the
U.S. military). If you have an urgent case, please do not delay case
management and treatment.

**  Please do not include patient identifiers (P.I.) in email inquiries.**

Please send your diagnostic request to **dpdx@cdc.gov**.
