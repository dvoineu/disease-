# Orf Virus (Sore Mouth Infection)

Minus

Related Pages

Orf virus is a member of the parapoxvirus genus in the Poxvirus family. This
virus primarily causes an infection in sheep and goats, although it can be
transmitted to people. Orf virus infection in animals is commonly referred to
as sore mouth, scabby mouth, or contagious ecthyma. Animals infected with orf
virus tyically develop scabby sores (lesions) around their lips, muzzle, and
in their mouth. Humans that are infected typically develop ulcerative lesions
or nodules on their hands. Infection with orf virus occurs throughout the
world, wherever small ruminants exist.
