## Summary

Down syndrome is a condition in which a person is born with an extra copy of
chromosome 21. People with Down syndrome can have physical problems, as well
as intellectual disabilities. Every person born with Down syndrome is
different.

People with the syndrome may also have other health problems. They may be born
with heart disease. They may have dementia. They may have hearing problems and
problems with the intestines, eyes, thyroid, and skeleton.

The chance of having a baby with Down syndrome increases as a woman gets
older. Down syndrome cannot be cured. Early treatment programs can help
improve skills. They may include speech, physical, occupational, and/or
educational therapy. With support and treatment, many people with Down
syndrome live happy, productive lives.
