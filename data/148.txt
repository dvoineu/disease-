## Summary

Sexual abuse is one form of child abuse. It includes a wide range of actions
between a child and an adult or older child. Often these involve body contact,
but not always. Exposing one's genitals to children or pressuring them for sex
is sexual abuse. Using a child for pornography is also sexual abuse.

Most sexual abusers know the child they abuse. They may be family friends,
neighbors or babysitters. About one-third of abusers are related to the child.
Most abusers are men. If you think a child may have been abused, it's
important to report it.
