## Summary

The tailbone is the small bone at the bottom of your backbone, or spine.
Tailbone disorders include tailbone injuries, pain, infections, cysts and
tumors. You rarely break your tailbone. Instead, most injuries cause bruises
or pulled ligaments. A backward fall onto a hard surface, such as slipping on
ice, is the most common cause of such injuries. Symptoms of various tailbone
disorders include pain in the tailbone area, pain upon sitting, pain or
numbness in the arms or legs due to pressure on nerves in the tailbone area,
and a mass or growth you can see or feel.
