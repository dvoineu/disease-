## Summary

There are many problems that can keep a woman from enjoying sex. They include

  * Lack of sexual desire 
  * Inability to become aroused
  * Lack of orgasm, or sexual climax
  * Painful intercourse

These problems may have physical or psychological causes. Physical causes may
include conditions like diabetes, heart disease, nerve disorders, or hormone
problems. Some drugs can also affect desire and function. Psychological causes
may include work-related stress and anxiety. They may also include depression
or concerns about marriage or relationship problems. For some women, the
problem results from past sexual trauma.

Occasional problems with sexual function are common. If problems last more
than a few months or cause distress for you or your partner, you should see
your health care provider.
