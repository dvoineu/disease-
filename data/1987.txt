## Summary

Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for many functions. For example, iron
is part of hemoglobin, a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs
throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also
part of many other proteins and enzymes.

Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron, you may
develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss,
poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher
risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant
or have periods.

Too much iron can damage your body. Taking too many iron supplements can cause
iron poisoning. Some people have an inherited disease called hemochromatosis.
It causes too much iron to build up in the body.
