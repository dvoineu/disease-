Rickets is a disorder caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It
leads to softening and weakening of the bones.

## Causes

Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood
levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that
cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak
and soft bones.

Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to
sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who:

    * Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight
    * Must stay indoors
    * Work indoors during the daylight hours

You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:

    * Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products)
    * DO NOT drink milk products
    * Follow a vegetarian diet

Infants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast
milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular
problem for darker-skinned children in winter months. This is because there
are lower levels of sunlight during these months.

Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to
rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in the diet is rare in
developed countries. Calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green
vegetables.

Your genes may increase your risk of rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of
the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys
are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by
kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis.

Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more
difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body.

Sometimes, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver.
These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.

Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children
during periods of rapid growth. This is the age when the body needs high
levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may be seen in children ages 6 to 24
months. It is uncommon in newborns.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of rickets include:

    * Bone pain or tendernessÂ in the arms, legs, pelvis, and spineÂ 
    * Decreased muscle tone (loss of muscle strength) and weakness that gets worse
    * Dental deformities, including delayed tooth formation, defects in the tooth structure, holes in the enamel, and increased cavitiesÂ (dental caries)
    * Impaired growth
    * Increased bone fractures
    * Muscle cramps
    * Short stature (adults less than 5 feet or 1.52 meters tall)
    * Skeletal deformities such as an odd-shaped skull,Â bowlegs, bumps in the ribcage (rachitic rosary), breastbone that is pushed forward (pigeon chest), pelvic deformities, and spine deformities (spine that curves abnormally, including scoliosis or kyphosis)

## Exams and Tests

A physical exam reveals tenderness or pain in the bones, but not in the joints
or muscles.

The following tests may help diagnose rickets:

    * Arterial blood gases
    * Blood tests (serum calcium)
    * Bone biopsy (rarely done)
    * Bone x-rays
    * Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
    * Serum phosphorus

Other tests and procedures include the following:

    * ALP isoenzyme
    * Calcium (ionized)
    * Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
    * Urine calcium

## Treatment

The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and correct the cause of the
condition. The cause must be treated to prevent the disease from returning.

Replacing calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that is lacking will eliminate
most symptoms of rickets. Dietary sources of vitamin D include fish liver and
processed milk.

Exposure to moderate amounts of sunlight is encouraged. If rickets is caused
by a metabolic problem, a prescription for vitamin D supplements may be
needed.

Positioning or bracing may be used to reduce or prevent deformities. Some
skeletal deformities may require surgery to correct them.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The disorder may be corrected by replacing vitamin D and minerals. Laboratory
values and x-rays usually improve after about 1 week. Some cases may require
large doses of minerals and vitamin D.

If rickets is not corrected while the child is still growing, skeletal
deformities and short stature may be permanent. If it is corrected while the
child is young, skeletal deformities often improve or disappear with time.

## Possible Complications

Possible complications are:

    * Long-term (chronic) skeletal pain 
    * Skeletal deformities 
    * Skeletal fractures, may occur without cause

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your child's health care provider if you notice symptoms of rickets.

## Prevention

You can prevent rickets by making sure that your child gets enough calcium,
phosphorus, and vitamin D in their diet. Children who have digestive or other
disorders may need to take supplements prescribed by the child's provider.

Kidney (renal) diseases that may cause poor vitamin D absorption should be
treated right away. If you haveÂ renal disorders, monitor calcium and
phosphorus levels regularly.

Genetic counseling may help people who have a family history of inherited
disorders that can cause rickets.

## Alternative Names

Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets
