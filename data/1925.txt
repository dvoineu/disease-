## Summary

Folic acid is a B vitamin. It helps the body make healthy new cells. Everyone
needs folic acid. For women who may get pregnant, it is really important.
Getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy can prevent major birth
defects of her baby's brain or spine.

Foods with folic acid in them include

    * Leafy green vegetables
    * Fruits
    * Dried beans, peas, and nuts
    * Enriched breads, cereals and other grain products

If you don't get enough folic acid from the foods you eat, you can also take
it as a dietary supplement.
