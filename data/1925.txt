### What's the bottom line?

![Test Tube Icon](/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/menthol-
cigarettes/images/test-tube-icon-thumbnail.png)

Tobacco companies add menthol to make cigarettes seem less harsh and more
appealing to new smokers and young people.

![Lungs Icon](/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/menthol-
cigarettes/images/lungs-icon-small.png)

Menthol cigarettes are not less harmful. They are just as dangerous as non-
menthol cigarettes.

![Group Icon](/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/menthol-
cigarettes/images/group-icon-small.png)

Different groups of people--like some racial/ethnic minorities, LGBT people,
people with mental health conditions, etc.--are more likely to smoke menthol
cigarettes than the rest of the population. This is particularly true for
African Americans.

![Quit Smoking Icon](/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/menthol-
cigarettes/images/quit-smoking-icon-small.png)

Some studies show that people who smoke menthol cigarettes have a harder time
quitting smoking than those who smoke non-menthol cigarettes.

![Hands Icon](/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/menthol-
cigarettes/images/hands-icon-small.png)

We can help reduce menthol cigarette smoking and help people who smoke menthol
cigarettes to quit with policies that limit where menthol cigarettes are sold
and marketed, and by reaching out to groups that are more likely to smoke
menthol cigarettes.

### What is Menthol?

Menthol is a chemical compound found naturally in peppermint and other similar
plants. Menthol can also be produced in a lab. Even though many brands of
cigarettes are marketed as "menthol cigarettes," almost all cigarettes sold in
the U.S. contain at least some natural or lab-created menthol.1 Usually, there
is more menthol in cigarettes marketed as "menthol" than in other cigarettes.
According to federal law, tobacco manufacturers cannot market cigarettes with
characterizing flavors (i.e. that have a distinct taste), _except_ for
cigarettes that taste like menthol or tobacco.2

Menthol in cigarettes creates a cooling sensation in the throat and airways
when the user inhales, making cigarette smoke feel less harsh on the user.1,3
Tobacco companies market menthol cigarettes as "smoother" than other
cigarettes.3 However, menthol cigarettes are not less harmful than other
cigarettes and they are likely a greater risk to public health than non-
menthol cigarettes.3

### Why is Menthol in Cigarettes Dangerous?

Smoking any kind of cigarette, including menthol cigarettes, is harmful and
increases risk for serious illness and death. Studies have shown that menthol
in cigarettes likely leads people--especially young people--to experiment with
smoking. It also could increase a young person's risk of becoming dependent on
nicotine.1 Compared to adults who smoke non-menthol cigarettes, adults who
smoke menthol cigarettes make more attempts to quit smoking and have a harder
time quitting.1,4

Marketing messages imply that menthol cigarettes are a "healthier"
alternative. This is not true; menthol cigarettes are just as dangerous as any
other type of cigarette.

### Different Groups Are at Higher Risk

Menthol cigarettes contribute to tobacco-related health disparities in the
U.S.3,5 This is because some groups of people are more likely to start smoking
menthol cigarettes and keep smoking because of menthol cigarettes, which puts
them at higher risk of getting tobacco-related diseases. Even though fewer
people are smoking any kind of cigarette now than in the past, the percentage
of people who smoke menthol cigarettes is going down more slowly than the
percentage of people who smoke non-menthol cigarettes.1,4

Young people and African Americans are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes
than other groups.1,3

These groups likely have higher percentages of menthol cigarette smoking in
part because the tobacco industry has aggressively marketed menthol products
to young people and African Americans, especially in urban communities.3 From
their research, tobacco manufacturers knew that young people preferred smaller
amounts of menthol in their menthol cigarettes, while older people who smoke
preferred more menthol. The tobacco companies purposely lowered the menthol in
some of their brands to make young people who smoke and those just starting to
smoke want to use them.1

Tobacco companies also target menthol cigarette marketing to people who are
new to smoking, mostly young people, using themes and images that appeal to
these groups, like popularity, being accepted by people in their age group,
and positive self-image. There also is heavy marketing by tobacco companies in
African American neighborhoods, magazines that are popular with African
Americans, and at music and lifestyle events aimed at African Americans.1,5

### Other High-Risk Groups

Menthol cigarette smoking also affects other groups of people. For instance,
women who smoke are more likely to use menthol cigarettes than men who
smoke.3,6 A 2009-2010 study showed LGBT people who smoke are more likely to
smoke menthol cigarettes than heterosexual people who smoke, and that the
difference was even greater in terms of LGBT women versus heterosexual
women.10 People with low levels of income or education are more likely to
smoke menthol cigarettes than other cigarettes.3 Adults who smoke and have
mental health conditions also are more likely to use menthol cigarettes than
those who do not have mental health conditions.11

### Menthol Smoking Continues to be a Problem

While fewer people now smoke cigarettes than in years past, the percentage of
people who smoke menthol cigarettes is going down more slowly than for non-
menthol cigarettes.1,4 From 2008-2010 to 2012-2014, the percentage of adult
smokers who currently smoke menthol cigarettes increased.6 Furthermore, from
2011-2015, menthol cigarette sales increased while overall cigarette sales
decreased.12 As of 2017, sales of menthol cigarettes made up 35% of all
cigarette sales in the U.S.--the highest proportion since major tobacco
companies were required to report those data.13
