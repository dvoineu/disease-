Around the world, 12.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer every year,
and the number is expected to increase due to the growth and aging of the
population, as well as reductions in childhood mortality and deaths from
infectious diseases in developing countries(1). Cancer is the leading cause of
death in developed countries and the second leading cause of death in
developing countries.

Cancer is a group of different diseases that have the same feature, the
uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Each different type of
cancer may have its own set of causes. Many factors play a role in the
development of cancer. The importance of these factors varies depending on the
type of cancer. A person's risk of developing a particular cancer is
influenced by a combination of factors that interact in ways that are not
fully understood. Some of the factors include:

carcinogens in animal studies or found to be possibly carcinogenic in human
studies. However, less than 2% of chemical or physical agents manufactured or
processed in the U.S. have been evaluated by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer for carcinogenicity(2). Based on well-documented
associations between occupational exposures and cancer, it has been estimated
that 3-6% of all cancers worldwide are caused by exposures to carcinogens in
the workplace (3,4). Using cancer incidence numbers in the U.S. (5), this
means that in 2012 (the most recent year available), there were between 45,872
and 91,745 new cancer cases that were caused by past exposure in the
workplace. This is probably an underestimate, partly because we continue to
discover new information about agents in the workplace that may cause cancer.
Also, these estimates may change over time as the number of cancers increase
or decrease in the U.S. Cancers that occur as a result of exposures in the
workplace are preventable, if exposures to known or suspected carcinogens can
be reduced(6-8).

The Work-Related Lung Disease (WoRLD) Surveillance System, produced by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), presents up-to-
date summary tables, graphs, and figures of occupationally-related respiratory
disease surveillance data on respiratory conditions including cancers, the
pneumoconioses, and occupational asthma and other airways diseases. For many
of these diseases, selected data on related exposures are also presented.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Training to Improve the Industry and Occupation Information in Cancer Registries  
NIOSH developed a training module to improve both the quality and the quantity
of industry and occupation information captured from hospital and clinic
records in order to increase the value of using this information for public
health surveillance and research with the ultimate goal of decreasing the
incidence of cancers related to workplace exposures.
