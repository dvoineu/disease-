## Summary

Weight loss surgery helps people with extreme obesity to lose weight. It may
be an option if you cannot lose weight through diet and exercise or have
serious health problems caused by obesity.

There are different types of weight loss surgery. They often limit the amount
of food you can take in. Some types of surgery also affect how you digest food
and absorb nutrients. All types have risks and complications, such as
infections, hernias, and blood clots.

Many people who have the surgery lose weight quickly, but regain some weight
later on. If you follow diet and exercise recommendations, you can keep most
of the weight off. You will also need medical follow-up for the rest of your
life.
