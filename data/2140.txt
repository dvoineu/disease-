## Summary

Vitiligo causes white patches on your skin. It can also affect your eyes,
mouth, and nose. It occurs when the cells that give your skin its color are
destroyed. No one knows what destroys them. It is more common in people with
autoimmune diseases, and it might run in families. It usually starts before
age 40.

The white patches are more common where your skin is exposed to the sun. In
some cases, the patches spread. Vitiligo can cause your hair to gray early. If
you have dark skin, you may lose color inside your mouth.

Using sunscreen will help protect your skin, and cosmetics can cover up the
patches. Treatments for vitiligo include medicines, light therapy, and
surgery. Not every treatment is right for everyone. Many have side effects.
Some take a long time. Some do not always work.
