Influenza

Cargo trucking is part of the critical infrastructure essential to maintaining
the Nation's continuity of operations in the event of an influenza (flu)
pandemic (a worldwide outbreak of a novel flu virus). This draft interim
guidance is meant to inform and educate cargo trucking management and crew
personnel about precautions and appropriate work practices to minimize
exposure and prevent workplace-related transmission of flu in the event of a
pandemic. These recommendations are primarily based on standard infection
control practices and information about preventing seasonal flu and specific
concerns associated with the potential for an outbreak of pandemic flu.

These guidelines were developed for the three main segments of the U.S.
trucking industry: government entities, private cargo carriers, and for-hire
motor carriers, but are also applicable for couriers, local delivery
enterprises, and other trucking operations such as refuse haulers. These
guidelines and recommendations may change as more becomes known about the
specifics of a particular flu pandemic, the virus believed to be responsible,
and the efficacy of public health control measures.

### Implementation of these Recommendations

To achieve maximum benefit, management should begin to implement these
guidelines and recommendations during the beginning stages of a pandemic;
specifically, during World Health Organization (WHO) pandemic phases 4 and 5
(evidence of increased or significant human-to-human flu transmission) or the
equivalent U.S. government response stage 2. Early adoption of this guidance
is recommended to prevent (to the greatest degree possible) and slow the
spread and infection of pandemic flu to cargo trucking personnel. Risks of
exposure to cargo trucking personnel are likely to increase as a flu pandemic
progresses to WHO phases 5 and 6 (significant and sustained human-to-human
transmission).

### Background

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified the **transportation
sector** as one of 13 critical infrastructures that are designated essential
in maintaining the Nation's continuity of operations in the event of a flu
pandemic. Critical transportation sectors include cargo trucking, which is
responsible for delivery of essential goods for business and is a key
contributor to daily aspects of public health, safety and welfare, and
national defense.

In the event of a pandemic, it is likely that employee absences in all
workforces will increase, in some cases by up to 40% of a workforce. Employee
work absences due to illness and/or caring for sick family members or children
dismissed from school could lead to dramatic disruptions in commerce. These
disruptions could have a significant impact on the U.S. economy and general
public welfare if deliveries of critical supplies such as food, medicines, and
other essential goods and materials get interrupted, delayed, or cancelled.
Because of the importance of maintaining cargo trucking operations during a
flu pandemic, managers and employees working in this sector should understand
the importance of (1) planning for business continuity of operations (COOP)
and (2) appropriate and recommended work practices and standard precautions to
minimize the risk of employees becoming ill and spreading flu in the
workplace.

### Exposure Risks for Cargo Trucking Personnel

Truck drivers in the United States work long hours (intercity drivers average
65 hours per week) and have frequent work activities that involve face-to-face
or close contact with other people. While cargo trucking crews spend most of
their work time driving, a recent study in Washington State reported that up
to 25% of a truck driver's time involves handling cargo and other materials.1
Frequent and close contact with other people during pick-up and delivery and
touching possibly contaminated items (such as pens, clipboards, handheld
scanning devices, etc.) are likely to pose the greatest exposure risks to
truck crews. Close contact with a variety of people throughout the day
increases the risk of encountering someone who is infected with flu and thus
increases the risk of contact, aerosol, or droplet transmission of flu
viruses.

**_Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for a Flu Pandemic 2_** is a document
developed jointly by the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and
Human Services that describes a variety of preparedness and prevention
practices intended for all workers. This document presents an occupational
exposure risk pyramid, scaled from low to very high exposure risks. Within
that pyramid, cargo trucking workers, particularly those who travel
extensively or work long hours while in contact with other workers or the
public, are considered to be at **medium risk** for contracting the flu.
Employers and employees in the transportation industry should review this
document to begin pandemic and COOP planning for their workplaces.

**Close contact with infected persons** is the greatest risk factor for
trucking personnel to become infected with pandemic flu. Flu viruses are
spread from person to person, primarily through large-particle respiratory
droplet transmission (e.g., when an infected person coughs or sneezes on or
near a susceptible person). Transmission via large-particle droplets requires
close contact between persons, because droplets do not remain suspended in the
air and generally travel only a short distance (about 3 to 6 feet) through the
air. Contact with surfaces contaminated with respiratory droplets is another
possible source of flu transmission. Localized airborne transmission may occur
via droplet nuclei or particles that are small enough to be inhaled, but
direct contact with infected persons and contact transmission are believed to
be the more common routes of transmission.

### Limiting Risks of Flu Exposures through Avoidance of Contacts with Other
People and General Infection Control Measures

Because completely eliminating face-to-face and close contact with other
persons is unlikely to be feasible, strong adherence to (and understanding of)
general infection control practices will be an important risk reduction
strategy.

**Limiting close face-to-face contacts** with other people is known as
**_social distancing_** ; it is an important protective behavior to limit the
risks of exposures from droplet, aerosol, or contact transmission in the event
of a flu pandemic. Social distancing generally means maintaining a distance of
3 feet or more between persons.

Practice social distancing in the cargo transport workplace:

For long-haul drivers, avoiding places where other people congregate (such as
truck stops) is one example of using social distancing. Another is maintaining
separation (again, roughly 3 feet) when in dispatch areas, locker rooms, while
refueling, during pickup and deliveries, and when working in an area where
there is likely to be a group of people.

**In the event of a pandemic, anticipating the need and necessary steps for
social distancing will be the key to effective implementation while minimizing
business disruptions.**

**Cough etiquette** is a behavior that can limit the transmission of droplet
nuclei and aerosols when you cough or sneeze. Practice cough etiquette by
always covering your mouth with a tissue or coughing or sneezing into your
shirt sleeve (holding the inside your elbow to your face) to help contain and
prevent flu viruses from being released into the air and contaminating other
surfaces (including your hands) that other people might touch or come into
contact with.

**Hand washing will be a very important practice in the event of a pandemic.
Cleaning your hands many times each day is one of the best ways to protect
yourself. Potentially infectious virus particles can be present on the skin
but can be effectively removed by soap and water or inactivated by using
waterless alcohol-based sanitizing gels (at least 60% alcohol).**

As a general rule, wash hands any time after sneezing or coughing, touching
someone else's hands, or touching potentially virus-contaminated surfaces
(commonly touched surfaces). Avoid handshaking or other unnecessary physical
contact during a pandemic. Examples of potentially contaminated surfaces can
include the following:

### Risk of Infection from Handling Truck Cargo

In studies, influenza A (and B) viruses can persist on porous and nonporous
surfaces for hours to days. If a surface is contaminated with a flu virus,
crew members might become infected by touching that surface and then touching
the mucous membranes of their eyes, nose, and mouth. Routine cleaning and
disinfection of frequently touched hard environmental surfaces is a reasonable
precaution. But the effectiveness of disinfection may vary depending on the
surface, the cleaning method, and the cleaning and disinfecting agent that is
used.

### Recommended Practices for Cleaning and Disinfecting Cabs and Trailers

To disinfect hard surfaces (plastic and metal), clean them with soap or
detergent in water to remove dirt and use disinfectants to inactivate flu
viruses. Inactivating or reducing the amount of flu viruses on a surface can
reduce the chances of hand contamination, transfer of the virus, and possible
infections in workers. Flu viruses may be inactivated by chemical
disinfectants such as these:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Chlorine or sodium hypochlorite (diluted household bleach)

If disinfectants are not available, use a **diluted** chlorine bleach solution. Carefully add 2 **teaspoons** of household bleach (5.25%-6%) into a quart (4 cups) of clear water. Wear rubber gloves and use a cloth to apply this to surfaces and let stand for 3-5 minutes before rinsing with clean water. For a larger supply of disinfectant, use ¼ cup of bleach in a gallon (16 cups) of water.

Combining certain products, such as chlorine bleach and ammonia cleaners, could result in toxic chemical vapors if inhaled can cause serious injury or even death.

Some disinfectant products (sanitizer cloths and liquid disinfectants)
available from grocery and hardware stores and commercial cleaning products
have been registered with the EPA. Use EPA-registered products when available.
Always follow label instructions carefully when using these products.

Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are often
more common in children than adults. Types and severity of symptoms could be
different with a novel (or pandemic strain) of flu.

### Management of Ill Crew

Cargo crew members who become ill with the flu should take the following
precautions:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If you have flu-like symptoms (or have household members who become ill), do not come to work or travel. The exception is local travel in a private vehicle to visit a health care facility for treatment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Crew members in the same cab should wear a NIOSH approved N95 (or greater efficiency, such as N99 or N100) filtering face piece respirator while transporting the ill person for health care.

Employers should take the following steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If a crew member becomes ill while working, send him or her home as soon as possible. Until then, the ill person should wear a surgical mask to decrease the possibility of transmitting the illness to others.
