What are e-cigarettes?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes. Most have a battery, a heating element, and a place to hold a liquid.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine--the addictive drug in regular cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products--flavorings, and other chemicals that help to make the aerosol. Users inhale this aerosol into their lungs. Bystanders can also breathe in this aerosol when the user exhales into the air.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * E-cigarettes are known by many different names. They are sometimes called "e-cigs," "e-hookahs," "mods," "vape pens," "vapes," "tank systems," and "electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)."

What are the health effects of using e-cigarettes?

E-cigarettes are still fairly new, and scientists are still learning about
their long-term health effects. Here is what we know now.

Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which has known health effects.1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Nicotine is highly addictive.

However, e-cigarette aerosol generally contains fewer harmful chemicals than smoke from burned tobacco products.

What are the risks of e-cigarettes for youth, young adults, and pregnant
women?

Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive and toxic to developing
fetuses. Nicotine exposure can also harm adolescent and young adult brain
development, which continues into the early to mid-20s.1 E-cigarette aerosol
can contain chemicals that are harmful to the lungs. And youth e-cigarette use
is associated with the use of other tobacco products, including cigarettes.

Are e-cigarettes less harmful than regular cigarettes?

![Cigarette and

Yes--but that doesn't mean e-cigarettes are safe. E-cigarette aerosol
generally contains fewer toxic chemicals than the deadly mix of 7,000
chemicals in smoke from regular cigarettes.3 However, e-cigarette aerosol is
not harmless. It can contain harmful and potentially harmful substances,
including nicotine, heavy metals like lead, volatile organic compounds, and
cancer-causing agents.1

Can e-cigarettes help adults quit smoking cigarettes?

![CAN E-CIGARETTES HELP ADULTS QUIT SMOKING
CIGARETTES?](/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/images/help-quit.png)

E-cigarettes are not currently approved by the FDA as a quit smoking aid. The
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a group of health experts that makes
recommendations about preventive health care, has concludedexternal icon that
evidence is insufficient to recommend e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in
adults, including pregnant women.3

![woman walking away from

However, e-cigarettes may help non-pregnant adult smokers if used as a
complete substitute for all cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products.

A Cochrane Reviewexternal icon found evidence from two randomized controlled trials that e-cigarettes with nicotine can help smokers stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo (non-nicotine) e-cigarettes.4 However, there are some limitations to the existing research, including the small number of trials, small sample sizes, and wide margins of error around the estimates.

Because smoking even a few cigarettes a day can be dangerous,6 quitting smoking completely is very important to protect your health.
