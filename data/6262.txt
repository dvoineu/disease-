### Abstract

Estimates of foodborne illness can be used to direct food safety policy and
interventions. We used data from active and passive surveillance and other
sources to estimate that each year 31 major pathogens acquired in the United
States caused 9.4 million episodes of foodborne illness (90% credible interval
[CrI] 6.6â12.7 million), 55,961 hospitalizations (90% CrI 39,534â75,741),
and 1,351 deaths (90% CrI 712â2,268). Most (58%) illnesses were caused by
norovirus, followed by nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. (11%), _Clostridium
perfringens_ (10%), and _Campylobacter_ spp. (9%). Leading causes of
hospitalization were nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. (35%), norovirus (26%),
_Campylobacter_ spp. (15%), and _Toxoplasma_ _gondii_ (8%). Leading causes of
death were nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. (28%), _T._ _gondii_ (24%),
_Listeria_ _monocytogenes_ (19%), and norovirus (11%). These estimates cannot
be compared with prior (1999) estimates to assess trends because different
methods were used. Additional data and more refined methods can improve future
estimates.

Estimates of the overall number of episodes of foodborne illness are helpful
for allocating resources and prioritizing interventions. However, arriving at
these estimates is challenging because food may become contaminated by many
agents (e.g., a variety of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals),
transmission can occur by nonfood mechanisms (e.g., contact with animals or
consumption of contaminated water), the proportion of disease transmitted by
food differs by pathogen and by host factors (e.g. age and immunity), and only
a small proportion of illnesses are confirmed by laboratory testing and
reported to public health agencies.

Laboratory-based surveillance provides crucial information for assessing
foodborne disease trends. However, because only a small proportion of
illnesses are diagnosed and reported, periodic assessments of total episodes
of illness are also needed. (Hereafter, episodes of illness are referred to as
illnesses.) Several countries have conducted prospective population-based or
cross-sectional studies to supplement surveillance and estimate the overall
number of foodborne illnesses ( _1_). In 2007, the World Health Organization
launched an initiative to estimate the global burden of foodborne diseases (
_2_).

In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided comprehensive
estimates of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United
States caused by known and unknown agents ( _3_). This effort identified many
data gaps and methodologic limitations. Since then, new data and methods have
become available. This article is 1 of 2 reporting new estimates of foodborne
diseases acquired in the United States (hereafter referred to as domestically
acquired). This article provides estimates of major known pathogens; the other
provides estimates for agents of acute gastroenteritis not specified in this
article ( _4_).

### Methods

Adequate data for preparing national estimates were available for 31
pathogens. We estimated the number of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations,
and deaths caused by these 31 domestically acquired pathogens by using data
shown in Table A1 and Technical Appendix 1.

Data were mostly from 2000â2008, and all estimates were based on the US
population in 2006 (299 million persons). Estimates were derived from
statistical models with many inputs, each with some measure of uncertainty (
_5_). To reflect this uncertainty, we used probability distributions to
describe a range of plausible values for all model inputs. We expressed model
outputs as probability distributions summarized by a mean point estimate with
90% credible intervals (CrIs). We used 2 types of modeling approaches for
different types of data: 1) models that began with counts of laboratory-
confirmed illnesses and were adjusted for undercounts (because of
underreporting and underdiagnosis) and thus scaled up to the estimated number
of illnesses and 2) models that began with a US population and used incidence
data to scale down to the estimated number of illnesses (Table 1). The
modeling approaches used and parameters of these probability distributions are
detailed in Technical Appendix 2 and Technical Appendix 3; the proportions
cited are modal values.

##### Illnesses

Laboratory-based surveillance data were available for 25 pathogens (Table A1).
The following events must occur for an illness to be ascertained and included
in laboratory-based surveillance: the ill person must seek medical care, a
specimen must be submitted for laboratory testing, the laboratory must test
for and identify the causative agent, and the illness must be reported to
public health authorities. If a break occurs in any of the first 3 steps of
this surveillance chain, the causative agent will not be laboratory confirmed
(underdiagnosis). Furthermore, although all laboratory-confirmed illnesses are
reported by active surveillance, some will not be reported by passive
surveillance (underreporting). Therefore, to estimate the number of illnesses
caused by pathogens under public health surveillance, we determined the number
of laboratory-confirmed illnesses and adjusted for underdiagnosis and, if
necessary, for underreporting by using a series of component multipliers.

Laboratory-confirmed illnesses for these 25 pathogens were reported through 5
surveillance programs: the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network
(FoodNet) for _Campylobacter_ spp., _Cryptosporidium_ spp., _Cyclospora
cayetanensis_ , Shiga toxinâproducing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) O157, STEC
non-O157, _Listeria monocytogenes_ , nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp.,
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, _Shigella_ spp., and _Yersinia
enterocolitica_ ; the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)
for _Brucella_ spp., _Clostridium botulinum_ , _Trichinella_ spp., hepatitis A
virus, and _Giardia intestinalis_ ; the Cholera and Other _Vibrio_ Illness
Surveillance (COVIS) system for toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ , _V. vulnificus_
, _V. parahemolyticus_ , and other _Vibrio_ spp.; the National Tuberculosis
Surveillance System (NTSS) for _Mycobacterium bovis_ ; and the Foodborne
Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) for _Bacillus cereus, Clostridium
perfringens,_ enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC), _Staphylococcus aureu_ s, and
_Streptococcus_ spp. group A (Table A1; Technical Appendix 1). When data were
available from >1 surveillance system, we used active surveillance data from
FoodNet, except for _Vibrio_ spp., for which we used COVIS because of
geographic clustering of _Vibrio_ spp. infections outside FoodNet sites. We
used data on outbreak-associated illnesses from FDOSS only for pathogens for
which no data were available from other systems.

Because FoodNet conducts surveillance at 10 sites ( _6_), we estimated the
number of laboratory-confirmed illnesses in the United States by applying
incidence from FoodNet to the estimated US population for 2006 ( _7_). We
constructed a probability distribution based on extrapolation of rates by year
(2005â2008) in each FoodNet site (Technical Appendix 3). We used data from
2005â2008 because the FoodNet surveillance area was constant during that
period and because FoodNet began collecting information on foreign travel in
2004. We used data from 2000â2007 for NNDSS, COVIS, and FDOSS and annual
counts of reported illnesses for our probability distributions. Some evidence
of trend was found for illness caused by hepatitis A virus, _S. aureus,_ and
_Vibrio_ spp.; therefore, recent years were weighted more heavily (Technical
Appendix 2, Technical Appendix 3). NTSS was used to determine the number of
reported illnesses caused by _M. bovis_ during 2004â2007.

We assumed that all laboratory-confirmed illnesses were reported to FoodNet
active surveillance in the relevant catchment areas. Because COVIS and NNDSS
conduct passive surveillance, we applied an underreporting multiplier (1.1 for
bacteria and 1.3 for parasites) derived by comparing incidence of all
nationally notifiable illnesses ascertained through FoodNet with that reported
to NNDSS (Technical Appendix 4) For the 5 bacteria for which only outbreak
data were available, we estimated the number of laboratory-confirmed illnesses
by creating an underreporting multiplier as follows. We determined the
proportion of illnesses ascertained through FoodNet that were caused by
_Campylobacter_ spp. _, Cryptosporidium_ spp., _C. cayatanensis_ , _L.
monocytogenes_ , _Salmonella_ spp., _Shigella_ spp., STEC, _Vibrio_ spp., and
_Y._ _enterocolitica_ that were also reported to FDOSS as outbreak associated
and applied the inverse of this proportion, 25.5, to those pathogens
(Technical Appendix 4). We assumed that all illnesses caused by _M. bovis_
were reported to NTSS.

To adjust for underdiagnosis resulting from variations in medical care
seeking, specimen submission, laboratory testing, and test sensitivity, we
created pathogen-specific multipliers. To adjust for medical care seeking and
specimen submission, we pooled data from FoodNet Population Surveys in
2000â2001, 2002â2003 ( _8_), and 2006â2007 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, unpub. data) from which we estimated the proportion of persons
who in the past month reported an acute diarrheal illness (>3 loose stools in
24 hours lasting >1 day or resulting in restricted daily activities) and
sought medical care and submitted a stool sample for that illness. Because
persons with more severe illness are more likely to seek care ( _9_), we
estimated pathogen-specific proportions of persons with laboratory-confirmed
infections who had severe illness (e.g., bloody diarrhea) and used medical
care seeking and stool sample submission rates for bloody (35% and 36%,
respectively) and nonbloody (18% and 19%, respectively) diarrhea as surrogates
for severe and mild cases of most illnesses (Technical Appendix 3). However,
for infections with _L. monocytogenes_ , _M. bovis_ , and _V. vulnificus_ and
severe infections with hepatitis A virus, we assumed high rates of medical
care seeking (i.e., we assumed that 100% of persons with _M. bovis_ infection
and 90% with _L. monocytogenes_ , _V. vulnificus_ , or severe hepatitis A
virus infections sought care) and specimen submission (100% for hepatitis A
virus and _M. bovis_ , 80% for others). We accounted for percentage of
laboratories that routinely tested for specific pathogens (25%â100%) and
test sensitivity (28%â100%) by using data from FoodNet ( _10_ _,_ _11_) and
other surveys of clinical diagnostic laboratory practices ( Technical Appendix
3). For the 5 pathogens for which data were from outbreaks only, we used the
nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. underdiagnosis multiplier.

Alternative approaches were used for infections not routinely reported by any
surveillance system (i.e., diarrheagenic _E. coli_ other than STEC and ETEC,
_T. gondii_ , astrovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, and norovirus) (Technical
Appendix 1, Technical Appendix 2, Technical Appendix 3). We assumed
diarrheagenic _E. coli_ other than STEC and ETEC to be as common as ETEC.
Illnesses caused by _T. gondii_ were estimated by using nationally
representative serologic data from the 1999â2004 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey ( _12_) and an estimate that clinical illness
develops in 15% of persons who seroconvert ( _13_). We assumed that 75% of
children experience an episode of clinical rotavirus illness by 5 years of
age, consistent with findings from other studies ( _14_), and used this
estimate for astrovirus and sapovirus. We estimated norovirus illnesses by
applying mean proportion of all acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus
(11%) according to studies in other industrialized countries ( _15_ _â_
_18_) to estimates of acute gastroenteritis from FoodNet Population Surveys (
Table A1; Technical Appendix 1, Technical Appendix 2, Technical Appendix 3) (
_4_).

##### Hospitalizations and Deaths

For most pathogens, numbers of hospitalizations and deaths were estimated by
determining (from surveillance data) the proportion of persons who were
hospitalized and the proportion who died and applying these proportions to the
estimated number of laboratory-confirmed illnesses (Table A1; Technical
Appendix 1, Technical Appendix 3). Rates of hospitalization and death caused
by _G._ _intestinalis_ and _T. gondii_ were based on the 2000â2006
Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Because some persons with illnesses that were not
laboratory confirmed would also have been hospitalized and died, we doubled
the number of hospitalizations and deaths to adjust for underdiagnosis,
similar to the method used by Mead et al. ( _3_) but applied an uncertainty
distribution (Technical Appendix 3). For diarrheagenic _E. coli_ other than
STEC and ETEC, total numbers of hospitalizations and deaths were assumed to be
the same as those for ETEC. For rotavirus, we used previous estimates ( _14_).
For astrovirus and sapovirus, we assumed that the number was 25% that of
rotavirus ( _19_ _,_ _20_). Numbers of norovirus hospitalizations and deaths
were determined by multiplying the estimated number of hospitalizations and
deaths caused by acute gastroenteritis, estimated by using national data on
outpatient visits resulting in hospitalization, hospital discharge surveys,
and death certificates (Table A1; Technical Appendix 1, Technical Appendix 2,
Technical Appendix 3) ( _4_), by the same norovirus proportion (11%) used to
estimate illnesses ( _15_ _â_ _18_).

##### Domestically Acquired Foodborne Illnesses

Data from published studies and surveillance were used to determine, for each
pathogen, the proportion of illnesses acquired while the person had been
traveling outside the United States (Technical Appendix 1, Technical Appendix
2, Technical Appendix 3). The remaining proportion was considered domestically
acquired. We based our estimates of the proportion of domestically acquired
foodborne illnesses caused by each pathogen on data from surveillance, risk
factor studies, and a literature review (Technical Appendix 1, Technical
Appendix 2, Technical Appendix 3).

##### Uncertainty Analysis

We used empirical data, when available, to define entire distributions or
parameters of distributions (Technical Appendix 3). When data were sparse, we
made reasoned judgments based on context, plausibility, and previously
published estimates. The parametric distribution used for almost all
multipliers was a 4-parameter beta (modified PERT) distribution ( _21_). The
first 3 parameters are low, modal, and high. The fourth parameter is related
to the variability of the distribution. We typically fixed this last parameter
at 4, which yields the simple PERT distribution ( _21_). However, when
describing the outbreak reporting multiplier, we used a value of 20 (Technical
Appendix 4).

Uncertainty in the estimates is the cumulative effect of uncertainty of each
of the model inputs. We iteratively generated sets of independent pathogen-
specific adjustment factors and used these multipliers to estimate illnesses,
hospitalizations, and deaths (Figure; Technical Appendix 2). On the basis of
100,000 iterations, we obtained empirical distributions of counts
corresponding to Bayesian posterior distributions and used these posterior
distributions to generate a point estimate (posterior mean) and upper and
lower 5% limits for 90% CrIs. Because incidence of illnesses differed by
location and over time, we included these variations in the models, which led
to wider CrIs than if we had assumed that inputs represented independent
random samples of a fixed US population. We used SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for these analyses.

### Results

##### Foodborne Illnesses

We estimate that each year in the United States, 31 pathogens caused 37.2
million (90% CrI 28.4â47.6 million) illnesses, of which 36.4 million (90%
CrI 27.7â46.7 million) were domestically acquired; of these, 9.4 million
(90% CrI 6.6â12.7 million) were foodborne (Table 2). We estimate that 5.5
million (59%) foodborne illnesses were caused by viruses, 3.6 million (39%) by
bacteria, and 0.2 million (2%) by parasites. The pathogens that caused the
most illnesses were norovirus (5.5 million, 58%), nontyphoidal _Salmonella_
spp. (1.0 million, 11%), _C. perfringens_ (1.0 million, 10%), and
_Campylobacter_ spp. (0.8 million, 9%).

##### Hospitalizations

We estimate that these 31 pathogens caused 228,744 (90% CrI 188,326â275,601)
hospitalizations annually, of which 55,961 (90% CrI 39,534â75,741) were
caused by contaminated food eaten in the United States (Table 3). Of these,
64% were caused by bacteria, 27% by viruses, and 9% by parasites. The leading
causes of hospitalization were nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. (35%), norovirus
(26%), _Campylobacter_ spp. (15%), and _T. gondii_ (8%).

##### Deaths

We estimate that these 31 pathogens caused 2,612 deaths (90% CrI
1,723â3,819), of which 1,351 (90% CrI 712â2,268) were caused by
contaminated food eaten in the United States (Table 3). Of these, 64% were
caused by bacteria, 25% by parasites, and 12% by viruses. The leading causes
of death were nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. (28%), _T. gondii_ (24%), _L.
monocytogenes_ (19%), and norovirus (11%).

### Discussion

We estimate that foods consumed in the United States that were contaminated
with 31 known agents of foodborne disease caused 9.4 million illnesses, 55,961
hospitalizations, and 1,351 deaths each year. Norovirus caused the most
illnesses; nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp., norovirus, _Campylobacter_ spp. _,_
and _T. gondii_ caused the most hospitalizations; and nontyphoidal
_Salmonella_ spp., _T._ _gondii_ , _L. monocytogenes_ , and norovirus caused
the most deaths. Scarce data precluded estimates for other known infectious
and noninfectious agents, such as chemicals. Foodborne diseases are also
caused by agents not yet recognized as being transmitted in food and by
unknown agents ( _22_). The numbers of illnesses caused by these unspecified
agents are estimated elsewhere ( _4_).

Studies estimating the overall number of foodborne illnesses have been
conducted in England and Wales and in Australia ( _23_ _,_ _24_). Similar to
our findings, in Australia norovirus was the leading cause of foodborne
illness, accounting for 30% of illnesses caused by known pathogens. In England
and Wales, norovirus accounted for only 8% of known foodborne illnesses;
however, stool sample reexamination using molecular techniques documented
higher rates ( _18_). Nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp. and _Campylobacter_ spp.
were leading causes of foodborne illnesses in all 3 countries (England and
Wales, Australia, and the United States), although nontyphoidal _Salmonella_
spp. accounted for a greater proportion of illness in the United States.
Recent serologic data from Europe suggest that _Salmonella_ spp. infections
are more common than estimated by our methods; however, many infections may be
asymptomatic ( _25_). Our estimates did not capture mild illnesses associated
with some pathogens. For example, mild cases of botulism are often recognized
as part of outbreaks, but affected persons seldom seek medical care and are
not captured by surveillance except during outbreaks ( _26_ _,_ _27_).
Likewise, _L. monocytogenes_ is rarely diagnosed as the cause of
gastroenteritis and fever, partly because this organism is not detected by
routine stool culture ( _28_). Early spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
associated with listeriosis may also be underdiagnosed.

Accurately estimating hospitalizations and deaths caused by foodborne
pathogens is particularly challenging. National data on outpatient visits
resulting in hospitalization, hospital discharges, and death certificates
probably substantially underestimate pathogen-specific cases because for
pathogen-specific diagnoses to be recorded, health care providers must order
the appropriate diagnostic tests and coding must be accurate. Particularly in
vulnerable populations, dehydration or electrolyte imbalance from a
gastrointestinal illness may exacerbate a chronic illness, resulting in
hospitalization or death well after resolution of the gastrointestinal
illness; thus, the gastrointestinal illness may not be coded as a contributing
factor. Moreover, if a pathogen is not detected, infections may be coded as
noninfectious illnesses ( _29_). For norovirus, we estimated the number of
hospitalizations and deaths by applying the estimated proportion of acute
gastroenteritis illnesses caused by norovirus to overall estimates of
hospitalizations and deaths from acute gastroenteritis; this choice is
supported by studies of hospitalizations for norovirus ( _30_ _,_ _31_). For
most other pathogens, we used data from surveillance to estimate pathogen-
specific hospitalizations and deaths and doubled the numbers to adjust for
underdiagnosis. More precise information about the degree of undercounting of
hospitalizations and deaths for each pathogen would improve these estimates.

Our methods and data differed from those used for the 1999 estimates ( _3_).
Our estimate of medical care seeking among persons with a diarrheal illness,
derived from the 3 most recent FoodNet Population Surveys conducted during
2000â2007, was higher than that estimated from the 1996â1997 FoodNet
Population Survey used for the 1999 estimates (35% and 18% among persons
reporting bloody and nonbloody diarrhea, respectively, compared with 15% and
12% in the earlier [1999] study) ( _8_). These data resulted in lower
underdiagnosis multipliers, which contributed to lower estimates of number of
illnesses. The biggest change from the earlier estimate was the estimated
number of norovirus illnesses, which decreased for 2 reasons. First, the
number of acute gastrointestinal illnesses estimated from the FoodNet
Population Survey and used in the current study was lower than the estimated
number of acute gastrointestinal illnesses used in the 1999 assessment. The
earlier study used data from 1996â1997; the sample size was one fifth as
large as ours and incorporated data from US studies conducted before 1980 (
_32_ _,_ _33_). Both estimates excluded persons reporting concurrent cough or
sore throat, but the proportion of persons reporting these signs and symptoms
was higher in the FoodNet Population Surveys we used than that in the older US
studies (38% vs. 25%), contributing to a lower estimated prevalence of acute
gastroenteritis (0.60 vs. 0.79 episodes/person/year) ( _4_, _32_ _,_ _33_).
Additionally, the current study excluded persons with vomiting who were ill
for <1 day or whose illness did not result in restricted daily activities,
whereas the earlier study included all vomiting episodes. These factors
contributed to the new estimate of acute gastroenteritis being 24% lower than
the earlier estimate, more likely the result of increased accuracy than a true
decrease in illnesses ( _4_). Second, the lower current estimate for norovirus
illnesses resulted from a lower proportion of norovirus estimated to be
foodborne (decreased from 40% to 26%); this lower proportion is similar to
that estimated in recent studies from other countries ( _23_ _,_ _24_).
Because of these reasons and use of other data sources and methods, our
estimate cannot be compared with the 1999 estimate for the purpose of
assessing trends. FoodNet provides the best data on trends over time ( _34_).

Data used in the current study came from a variety of sources and were of
variable quality and representativeness. FoodNet sites, from which we used
data for 10 pathogens, are not completely representative of the US population,
but 1 study indicated that demographic data from FoodNet and from the 2005 US
census did not differ much ( _6_). For 5 pathogens, only data on foodborne
outbreakârelated cases were available. No routine surveillance data were
available for most viruses, forcing us to use a different modeling approach
for viruses than for most other pathogens. Given the large number of norovirus
illnesses in these estimates, the paucity of supporting data is a major
limitation. Moreover, combining different methods is not optimal because
methods themselves may affect the estimates. We chose our modeling approach
and used the PERT distribution for many inputs because data were sometimes
limited and subjective decisions were required. Other investigators could have
chosen other distributions, for good reasons, and arrived at different
estimates.

Our assumptions about the proportion of illnesses transmitted by food
profoundly affect our estimates, but data on which to base these estimates
were often lacking. We used data from surveillance, risk factor studies, and
the current literature to estimate the proportion of pathogen-specific
illnesses caused by consumption of contaminated food ( _35_), but it is not
known how representative these data are of total illnesses and whether the
foodborne proportion is similar across age groups. For example, the proportion
of some illnesses acquired from animals (e.g., STEC O157) may be higher among
children than adults ( _36_), and the proportions that spread person-to-person
(e.g., norovirus) may be higher among institutionalized elderly persons (
_37_). Because a higher proportion of cases are reportedly associated with
hospitalization or death in these vulnerable groups, we may have overestimated
the total contribution of foodborne transmission for these outcomes.

The methods used for this study could be adapted to estimate the proportion of
illnesses attributable to other modes of transmission, such as waterborne and
direct animal contact. The estimates from this study can be used to help
direct policy and interventions; to conduct other analyses (e.g., evaluation
of economic cost of these diseases and attribution to various food
commodities); and as a platform for developing estimates of effects of disease
caused by sequelae of foodborne infections.
