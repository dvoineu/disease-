## Summary

Genetic tests are tests on blood and other tissue to find genetic disorders.
Over 2000 tests are available. Doctors use genetic tests for several reasons.
These include

    * Finding genetic diseases in unborn babies
    * Finding out if people carry a gene for a disease and might pass it on to their children
    * Screening embryos for disease 
    * Testing for genetic diseases in adults before they cause symptoms
    * Making a diagnosis in a person who has disease symptoms
    * Figuring out the type or dose of a medicine that is best for a certain person

People have many different reasons for being tested or not being tested. For
some, it is important to know whether a disease can be prevented or treated if
a test is positive. In some cases, there is no treatment. But test results
might help a person make life decisions, such as family planning or insurance
coverage. A genetic counselor can provide information about the pros and cons
of testing.
