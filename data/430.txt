## Summary

Smoking cigarettes has many health risks for everyone. However, the younger
you are when you start smoking, the more problems it can cause. People who
start smoking before the age of 21 have the hardest time quitting. Teens who
smoke are also more likely to use alcohol and illegal drugs.

The problem is not just cigarettes. Spit tobacco, e-cigarettes, and cigars are
not safe alternatives to cigarettes. Low-tar and additive-free tobacco
products are not safe either.

Young people who do not start using tobacco by age 18 will most likely never
start.
