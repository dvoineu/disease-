The goal of ergonomics (i.e. the scientific study of people at work) is to
prevent soft tissue injuries and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) caused by
sudden or sustained exposure to force, vibration, repetitive motion, and
awkward posture. To create an ergonomically sound work environment, NIOSH
ergonomists and industrial hygienists recommend designing tasks, work spaces,
controls, displays, tools, lighting, and equipment to fit employee's physical
capabilities and limitations. On this page you will find the Musculoskeletal
Health Program's ergonomic recommendations and musculoskeletal health-related
research.
