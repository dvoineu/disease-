#  Earthquakes

## Summary

An earthquake happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one
another. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently, and without warning at any
time of the day or night. If an earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may
cause property damage, injuries, and even deaths. If you live in a coastal
area, there is the possibility of a tsunami. Damage from earthquakes can also
lead to floods or fires.

Although there are no guarantees of safety during an earthquake, you can take
actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared
can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it
is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.
