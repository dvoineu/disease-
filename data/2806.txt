# What is a stroke?

A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, happens when blood flow to an area
of the brain is cut off. When brain cells are starved of oxygen, they die.
Stroke is a medical emergency. It's important to get treatment as soon as
possible. A delay in treatment increases the risk of permanent brain damage or
death.

# What puts women at risk for stroke?

**High blood pressure, also called hypertension,** is a main risk factor for
stroke. About 1 in 3 women have stage 2 hypertension (having a blood pressure
greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg), and only about half have it under
control.5

Stroke risk increases with **age** , and women live longer than men.

Women also have unique risk factors for stroke, including:

# Why are African American women at higher risk for stroke?

![Alyson McCord](/stroke/images/alyson-mccord.jpg)

Alyson McCord struggled to control her high blood pressure for years and
eventually had a stroke. She encourages all women to advocate for their
health. Read Alyson's story.

African American women are more likely to have a stroke than any other group
of women in the United States.1 They are also more likely to have strokes at
younger ages and to have more severe strokes.8

Almost half of African Americans have a risk factor that can lead to a
stroke.9

# Why are Hispanic women at risk for stroke?

# How can I prevent stroke?

High blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for a stroke. Measure your
blood pressure regularly to help your health care team diagnose any health
problems early.

Most strokes can be prevented by keeping medical conditions under control and
making healthy lifestyle changes:

Know your ABCS of heart and brain health:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Aspirin:** Aspirin may help reduce your risk for stroke, but you should check with your doctor before taking aspirin, because it can make some types of stroke worse. Before taking aspirin, talk with your doctor about whether it is right for you.
