#  Islet Cell Transplantation

## Summary

Islets are cells found in clusters throughout the pancreas. They are made up
of several types of cells. One of these is beta cells, which make insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell
transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another
person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.

In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A
person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted
islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta
cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope
islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily
insulin injections.
