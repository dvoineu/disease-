Typhus fevers are a group of diseases caused by bacteria that are spread to
humans by fleas, lice, and chiggers. Typhus fevers include scrub typhus,
murine typhus, and epidemic typhus. Chiggers spread scrub typhus, fleas spread
murine typhus, and body lice spread epidemic typhus. The most common symptoms
are fever, headaches, and sometimes rash.
