## Summary

Endoscopy is a procedure that lets your doctor look inside your body. It uses
an instrument called an endoscope, or scope for short. Scopes have a tiny
camera attached to a long, thin tube. The doctor moves it through a body
passageway or opening to see inside an organ. Sometimes scopes are used for
surgery, such as for removing polyps from the colon.

There are many different kinds of endoscopy. Here are the names of some of
them and where they look.

    * Arthroscopy: joints
    * Bronchoscopy: lungs
    * Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy: large intestine
    * Cystoscopy and ureteroscopy: urinary system
    * Laparoscopy: abdomen or pelvis
    * Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: esophagus and stomach
