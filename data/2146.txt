## Summary

You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral. Calcium has many
important jobs. The body stores more than 99 percent of its calcium in the
bones and teeth to help make and keep them strong. The rest is throughout the
body in blood, muscle and the fluid between cells. Your body needs calcium to
help muscles and blood vessels contract and expand, to secrete hormones and
enzymes and to send messages through the nervous system.

It is important to get plenty of calcium in the foods you eat. Foods rich in
calcium include

    * Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
    * Leafy, green vegetables
    * Fish with soft bones that you eat, such as canned sardines and salmon
    * Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. Check the product labels.

The exact amount of calcium you need depends on your age and other factors.
Growing children and teenagers need more calcium than young adults. Older
women need plenty of calcium to prevent osteoporosis. People who do not eat
enough high-calcium foods should take a calcium supplement.
