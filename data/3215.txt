Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a disorder in which the body cannot break
down certain parts of proteins. The urine of people with this condition can
smell like maple syrup.

## Causes

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is inherited, which means it is passed down
through families. It is caused by a defect in 1 of 3 genes. People with this
condition cannot break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the blood.

In the most severe form, MSUD can damage the brain during times of physical
stress (such as infection, fever, or not eating for a long time).

Some types of MSUD are mild or come and go. Even in the mildest form, repeated
periods of physical stress can cause mental disability and high levels of
leucine to build up.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of this disorder include:

    * Coma
    * Feeding difficulties
    * Lethargy
    * Seizures
    * Urine that smells like maple syrup
    * Vomiting 

## Exams and Tests

These tests may be done to check for this disorder:

    * Plasma amino acid test
    * Urine organic acid test
    * Genetic testing

There will be signs of ketosis (buildup of ketones, a by-product of burning
fat) and excess acid in the blood (acidosis).

## Treatment

When the condition is diagnosed, and during episodes, treatment involves
eating a protein-free diet. Fluids, sugars, and sometimes fats are given
through a vein (IV). Dialysis through your belly or a vein can be done to
reduce the level of abnormal substances in your blood.

Long-term treatment requires a special diet. For infants, the diet includes a
formula with low levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
People with this condition must remain on a diet low in these amino acids for
life.

It is very important to always follow this diet to prevent nervous system
(neurological) damage. This requires frequent blood tests and close
supervision by a registered dietitian and physician, as well as cooperation by
parents of children with the condition.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

This disease can be life threatening if untreated.

Even with dietary treatment, stressful situations and illness can still cause
high levels of certain amino acids. Death may occur during these episodes.
With strict dietary treatment, children have grown into adulthood and can
remain healthy.

## Possible Complications

These complications can occur:

    * Neurological damage
    * Coma
    * Death
    * Mental disability

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if you have a family history of MSUD and are
planning to start a family. Also call your providerÂ right awayÂ if you have a
newborn who has symptoms of maple syrup urine disease.

## Prevention

Genetic counseling is suggested for people who want to have children and who
have a family history of maple syrup urine disease. Many states now screen all
newborns with blood testing for MSUD.

If a screening test shows that your baby may have MSUD, a follow-up blood test
for amino acid levels should be done right away to confirm the disease.
