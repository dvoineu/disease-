#  Cat Scratch Disease

Also called: Cat scratch fever, CSD

## Summary

Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an illness caused by the bacterium Bartonella
henselae. Almost half of all cats carry the infection at some point. The
infection does not make cats sick. However, the scratch or bite of an infected
cat can cause symptoms in people, including

    * Swollen lymph nodes, especially around the head, neck, and upper limbs
    * Fever
    * Headache
    * Fatigue
    * Poor appetite 

For people with weak immune systems, CSD may cause more serious problems. The
best way to avoid CSD is to avoid rough play with cats that could lead to
scratches or bites. If you do get a scratch or bite, wash it well with soap
and water. If the bite or scratch gets infected or if you have symptoms of
CSD, call your doctor.
