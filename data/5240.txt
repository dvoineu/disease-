Toxic megacolon occurs when swelling and inflammation spread into the deeper
layers of your colon. As a result, the colon stops working and widens. In
severe cases, the colon may rupture.

## Causes

The term "toxic" means that this problem is very dangerous. Toxic megacolon
may occur in people with an inflamed colon due to:

    * Ulcerative colitis, or Crohn disease that is not well controlled 
    * Infections of the colon such as _Clostridium difficile_

Other forms of megacolon include pseudo-obstruction, acute colonic ileus, or
congenital colonic dilation. These conditions do not involve an infected or
inflamed colon.

## Symptoms

The rapid widening of the colon may cause the following symptoms to occur over
a short period of time:

    * Painful, distended abdomen
    * Fever
    * Diarrhea (usually bloody)

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Findings may include:

    * Tenderness in the abdomen
    * Reduced or absent bowel sounds

The exam may reveal signs of septic shock, such as:

    * Increased heart rate
    * Mental status changes
    * Rapid heart rate
    * Low blood pressure

The provider may order any of the following tests:

    * Abdominal x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scanÂ 
    * Blood electrolytes
    * Complete blood count

## Treatment

Treatment of the disorder that led to toxic megacolon includes:

    * Steroids and other medicines that suppress the immune system
    * Antibiotics

If you have septic shock, you will be admitted to the intensive care unit of
the hospital. Treatment may include:

    * Breathing machine (mechanical ventilation)
    * Dialysis for kidney failure
    * Drugs to treat low blood pressure, infection, or poor blood clotting
    * Fluids given directly into a vein
    * Oxygen

If rapid widening is not treated, an opening or rupture can form in the colon.
Therefore, most cases of toxic megacolon will need surgery to remove a part of
or the entire colon.

You may receive antibiotics to prevent sepsis (a severe infection).

## Outlook (Prognosis)

If the condition does not improve, it can be fatal. Colon surgery is usually
needed in such cases.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Perforation of the colon
    * Sepsis
    * Shock 
    * Death

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if
you develop severe abdominal pain, especially if you also have:

    * Bloody diarrhea
    * Fever
    * Frequent diarrhea
    * Rapid heart rate
    * Tenderness when the abdomen is pressed
    * Abdominal distention

## Prevention

Treating diseases that cause toxic megacolon, such as ulcerative colitis or
Crohn disease, can prevent this condition.

## Alternative Names

Toxic dilation of the colon; Megarectum; Inflammatory bowel disease - toxic
megacolon; Crohn disease - toxic megacolon; Ulcerative colitis - toxic
megacolon
