CDC and partners ensure rapid and coordinated surveillance, detection, and
response to hepatitis outbreaks.

DVH laboratory branch participates in outbreak investigations related to
hepatitis viruses by performing routine and state of the art serologic and
molecular methodologies on clinical samples collected from affected patients.
An epidemiologist from the division coordinates all outbreak investigation
related activities including submitting a study request and sharing of
laboratory results with the state health departments. CDC staff are always
available for consultation including discussion of testing algorithms for
specific notification settings.
