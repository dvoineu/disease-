As directed by the June 14, 2019, Executive Order on Evaluating and Improving
the Utility of Federal Advisory Committees (EO 13875), CDC has ended the term
of this committee. The information on this page is no longer being updated.

### CDC Advisory Committees

Federal advisory committees are a key component of CDC's overall strategy to
achieve stakeholder and public engagement in its efforts and commitment to
improve people's health.

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 92-463) provides a mechanism
for experts and stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process,
offering advice and recommendations to the Federal government as members of
advisory committees. The important contribution made by Federal advisory
committees is overseen at the highest levels of government: the Congress, the
President of the United States and the General Services Administrator (through
authority delegated by the President). At the CDC, advisory committee activity
is overseen by the Management Analysis and Services Office.

Currently, twenty-four federal advisory committees provide advice and
recommendations on a broad range of public health issues to help the agency
achieve its mission to promote health and quality of life by preventing and
controlling disease, injury, and disability. Among the program areas our
committees deliberate on are occupational and environmental health, healthcare
infection control and clinical laboratory standards, smoking, breast and
cervical cancer, HIV, STDs and Tuberculosis, childhood and adult
immunizations, and injury prevention and control.

### ACD Agency Advisory Committee (FACA Exempt)

                    * CDC/ATSDR Tribal Advisory Committee (FACA Exempt)

The purpose of the CDC Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC), a FACA Exempt Agency
Advisory Committee, is to provide a complementary venue wherein tribal
representatives and CDC staff will exchange information about public health
issues in Indian country, identify urgent public health needs in AI/AN
communities, and discuss collaborative approaches to addressing these issues
and needs. The CDC TAC will support, and not supplant any other government-to-
government consultation activities that CDC undertakes.

#### The Intergovernmental Exemption to FACA

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to actions
in support of intergovernmental communications where

                    * (1) meetings are held exclusively between Federal officials and elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf) acting in their official capacities; and
                    * (2) such meetings are solely for the purposes of exchanging views, information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs established pursuant to public law that explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or administration. (2 U.S.C. 1534(b)
