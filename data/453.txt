## Summary

Many disorders can affect our ability to speak and communicate. They range
from saying sounds incorrectly to being completely unable to speak or
understand speech. Causes include

    * Hearing disorders and deafness
    * Voice problems, such as dysphonia or those caused by cleft lip or palate
    * Speech problems like stuttering
    * Developmental disabilities
    * Learning disabilities
    * Autism spectrum disorder
    * Brain injury
    * Stroke

Some speech and communication problems may be genetic. Often, no one knows the
causes. By first grade, about 5 percent of children have noticeable speech
disorders. Speech and language therapy can help.
