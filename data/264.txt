## Summary

Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses. They involve long-term
patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are unhealthy and inflexible. The
behaviors cause serious problems with relationships and work. People with
personality disorders have trouble dealing with everyday stresses and
problems. They often have stormy relationships with other people.

The cause of personality disorders is unknown. However, genes and childhood
experiences may play a role.

The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. They can mild or
severe. People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they
have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal, and they often blame
others for their problems. They may try to get help because of their problems
with relationships and work. Treatment usually includes talk therapy and
sometimes medicine.
