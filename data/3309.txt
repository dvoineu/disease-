Please see this summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) results for
more information.

###  What is the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT)?

The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) is an evaluation tool developed by
CDC and external influenza experts that assesses the potential pandemic risk
posed by influenza A viruses that currently circulate in animals but not in
humans. The IRAT assesses potential pandemic risk based on two different
scenarios: "emergence" and "public health impact."

"Emergence" refers to the risk of a novel (i.e., new in humans) influenza
virus acquiring the ability to spread easily and efficiently in people.
"Public health impact" refers to the potential severity of human disease
caused by the virus (e.g., deaths and hospitalizations) as well as the burden
on society (e.g., missed workdays, strain on hospital capacity and resources,
and interruption of basic public services) if a novel influenza virus were to
begin spreading efficiently and sustainably among people.

The IRAT uses 10 scientific criteria to measure the potential pandemic risk
associated with each of these scenarios. These 10 criteria can be grouped into
three overarching categories: "properties of the virus," "attributes of the
population," and "ecology & epidemiology of the virus." Influenza subject
matter experts evaluate novel influenza viruses based on each of these 10
criteria. Each of the 10 criteria is then weighted statistically based on its
significance to each of the two scenarios. A composite score for each virus is
then calculated based on the given scenario. These composite scores provide a
means to rank and compare influenza viruses to each other in terms of their
potential pandemic risk for each of the two scenarios.

As we learn more about influenza A viruses, these 10 criteria may change,
other criteria may be added or some current criteria may be dropped. The IRAT
is designed to be flexible and responsive to current scientific advances.

###  Can the IRAT predict a future pandemic?

No. The IRAT is an evaluative tool, not a predictive tool. Flu is
unpredictable, as are future pandemics.

###  What is the purpose of the IRAT?

The IRAT is intended to do the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness by helping to determine which novel (new) influenza viruses to develop vaccines against and capitalizing on surveillance efforts and in-country capacity building activities;

###  Does the IRAT have any limitations?

Yes. The IRAT cannot predict the next pandemic and is not intended to do so.
Furthermore, the IRAT is not intended to eliminate the need for subject matter
expertise. In fact, subject matter experts are needed to carefully analyze the
10 criteria of the IRAT to make determinations of pandemic risk and to rank
the importance of the criteria according to the specific risk question or
situation. Lastly, the IRAT is not intended to make exact risk estimates. For
example, many risk assessments generate a quantitative measure that describes
the likelihood of exposure or disease risk. The IRAT focuses on the perceived
pandemic potential of novel influenza viruses as estimated by subject matter
experts using the IRAT evaluation criteria and available data.

###  What are the evaluation criteria used by the IRAT?

The IRAT consists of 10 evaluation criteria grouped within three overarching
categories. These categories and criteria are described as follows:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * The **" Properties of the Virus"** category contains four of the 10 evaluation criteria, including: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. **Genomic analysis** is a measure of the extent of genetic diversity or presence of known molecular signatures important for human infections and disease.

Some influenza viruses are better adapted to infecting humans as opposed to animals.

###  How are the IRAT's 10 evaluation criteria ranked and weighted?

Each of the 10 evaluation criteria provided in the IRAT tool are used by
influenza experts to generate point scores estimating the potential pandemic
risk associated with that criterion. The point scores fall into three general
classifications of risk: **low risk** , **moderate risk** and **high risk**.

Each of the 10 evaluation criteria also are weighted according to importance
to each of the two scenarios: **emergence** and **public health impact**.

**Potential Emergence Risk** (Column 3 in Table)

The first scenario is: **" What is the risk that a novel virus has the
potential for sustained human-to-human transmission?"** The evaluation
criteria may be ranked and weighted as follows (with the first criterion
receiving the highest rank and weight score, and the last criterion receiving
the lowest rank and weight score).

**Potential Impact Risk** (Column 4 in Table)

The second scenario is: " **If the virus were to achieve sustained human-to-
human transmission, what is the risk that a novel virus has the potential for
significant impact on public health? "** The same evaluation criteria could be
ranked and weighted as follows (with the first criterion receiving the highest
rank and weight score, and the last criterion receiving the lowest rank and
weight score).

### Does the IRAT get updated?

In 2018, the CDC Influenza Division coordinated a review of the IRAT with the
objectives of identifying any need for updating or replacing evaluation
criteria and further refining their definitions for clarity. The review
resulted in a confirmation of all 10 evaluation criteria and a refinement of
the technical definitions of each criterion. A recently scored virus was re-
evaluated with the updated IRAT as a validation approach. The conclusion of
the validation exercise was that the revised IRAT achieved scores similar to
the original version, provided risk element definitions of greater clarity,
and, therefore, is suitable for future evaluations. For more details on the
validation, click here pdf icon[233 KB, 6 Pages].

CDC has prepared a summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) results.
