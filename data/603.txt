## Summary

Most men need to pay more attention to their health. Compared to women, men
are more likely to

    * Smoke and drink
    * Make unhealthy or risky choices
    * Put off regular checkups and medical care

There are also health conditions that only affect men, such as prostate cancer
and low testosterone. Many of the major health risks that men face - like
colon cancer or heart disease \- can be prevented and treated with early
diagnosis. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they are easier to
treat. It's important to get the screening tests you need.
