## Summary

A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other
germs to cause illness or death. These germs are often found in nature. But
they can sometimes be made more harmful by increasing their ability to cause
disease, spread, or resist medical treatment.

Biological agents spread through the air, water, or in food. Some can also
spread from person to person. They can be very hard to detect. They don't
cause illness for several hours or days. Scientists worry that anthrax,
botulism, Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague, or smallpox could
be used as biological agents.

Biodefense uses medical measures to protect people against bioterrorism. This
includes medicines and vaccinations. It also includes medical research and
preparations to defend against bioterrorist attacks.
