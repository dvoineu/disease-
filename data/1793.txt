![CDC field worker collecting a tick specimen](/vhf/crimean-
congo/images/tick.jpg)Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by
infection with a tick-borne virus _(Nairovirus)_ in the family _Bunyaviridae_.
The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name
Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause
of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in
the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China,
central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian
subcontinent.

Transmission

Ixodid (hard) ticks are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus...

Signs and Symptoms

The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including
headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting...

Risk of Exposure

Animal herders, livestock workers, and slaughterhouse workers in endemic areas
are at risk of CCHF...

Diagnosis

Laboratory tests that are used to diagnose CCHF include antigen-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)...

Treatment

Treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive...

Prevention

Agricultural workers and others working with animals should use insect
repellent on exposed skin and clothing...
