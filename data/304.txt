## Summary

Disabilities make it harder to do normal daily activities. They may limit what
you can do physically or mentally, or they can affect your senses. Disability
doesn't mean unable, and it isn't a sickness. Most people with disabilities
can - and do - work, play, learn, and enjoy full, healthy lives. Mobility aids
and assistive devices can make daily tasks easier.

About one in every five people in the United States has a disability. Some
people are born with one. Others have them as a result of an illness or
injury. Some people develop them as they age. Almost all of us will have a
disability at some point in our lives.
