Most adults who drink at risky levels and were asked about their alcohol use
during a checkup did not receive advice to drink less from their providers,
according to a new CDC study.

**Most adults who drink at risky levels and were asked about their alcohol use
during checkups were not advised to drink less** , according to a new Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study. The study looked at alcohol
screening and brief counseling practices among healthcare providers in 17
states and the District of Columbia. Alcohol screening and brief counseling is
an approach based on the best available scientific evidence that can help
adults who drink alcohol at risky levels to reduce the amount that they drink.

In the United States, risky alcohol use resulted in more than $249 billion in
economic costs in 2010 and over 88,000 deaths every year from 2006-2010. Risky
alcohol use includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any use by pregnant
women or those under age 21. Binge drinking is drinking five or more drinks on
a single occasion for men or four or more drinks on a single occasion for
women. Heavy drinking (also considered high weekly or daily consumption) is
drinking 15 or more drinks per week for men or eight or more drinks per week
for women.

Risky alcohol use increases the risk for developing long-standing diseases
(such as heart disease and breast cancer), as well as injuries and violence
(such as motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide). Any alcohol use by
pregnant women increases the risk for miscarriage, stillbirth, and a range of
lifelong disorders in their babies known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
(FASDs).

### Alcohol Screening and Brief Counseling

Similar to screenings for blood pressure or tobacco use, alcohol screening and
brief counseling is an effective clinical preventive service that is supported
by decades of research. It is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task
Forceexternal icon and medical organizations, such as the American Academy of
Family Physicians, the American Medical Association, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. In
2014, CDC published a guide pdf icon[2 MB, 52 Pages, Print Only] to help
primary medical care practices incorporate alcohol screening and brief
counseling into routine clinic visits.

These findings indicate that routine alcohol screening and brief counseling,
as recommended, is not yet a standard part of primary medical care. This is
despite evidence that it works, is cost-effective (good value for the amount
of money that it costs), and is recommended for all adults during routine
clinic visits with their primary healthcare providers. Continued efforts are
needed to increase adoption of alcohol screening and brief counseling by
healthcare providers to reduce risky alcohol use among adults.
