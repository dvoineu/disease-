**Hepatitis E** is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV).
People infected with HEV usually recover fully from the disease without any
complications. While hepatitis E is rare in the United States, hepatitis E is
common in many parts of the world. It is transmitted from ingestion of fecal
matter, even in microscopic amounts, and is usually associated with a
contaminated water supply in countries with poor sanitation. In developed
countries like the United States where people have access to clean drinking
water, hepatitis E is a foodborne disease transmitted by consumption of
uncooked or undercooked pork or venison, as well as boar meat.  No U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine for hepatitis E is currently
available in the United States; however, in 2012 a recombinant vaccine was
approved for use in China.
