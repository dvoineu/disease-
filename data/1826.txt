## Summary

Face injuries and disorders can cause pain and affect how you look. In severe
cases, they can affect sight, speech, breathing and your ability to swallow.
Fractures (broken bones), especially in the bones of your nose, cheekbone and
jaw, are common facial injuries.

Certain diseases also lead to facial disorders. For example, nerve diseases
like trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy sometimes cause facial pain, spasms
and trouble with eye or facial movement. Birth defects can also affect the
face. They can cause underdeveloped or unusually prominent facial features or
a lack of facial expression. Cleft lip and palate are a common facial birth
defect.
