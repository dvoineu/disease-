# Brain natriuretic peptide test

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test is a blood test that measures levels of a
protein called BPN that is made by your heart and blood vessels. BNP levels
are higher than normal when you have heart failure.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. The blood is taken from a vein (venipuncture).

This test is most often done in the emergency room or hospital. Results take
up to 15 minutes. In some hospitals, a finger prick test with rapid results is
available.

## How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel a little pain. Most
people feel only a prick or a stinging sensation. Afterward there may be some
throbbing or bruising.

## Why the Test is Performed

You may need this test if you have signs of heart failure. Symptoms include
shortness of breath and swelling of your legs or abdomen. The test helps make
sure the problems are due to your heart and not your lungs, kidneys, or liver.

It is unclear if repeated BNP tests are helpful in guiding treatment in those
already diagnosed with heart failure.

## Normal Results

In general, results of less than 100 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) are a sign a
person does not have heart failure.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs
use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care
provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

BNP levels go up when the heart cannot pump the way it should.

A result greater than 100 pg/mL is abnormal. The higher the number, the more
likely heart failure is present and the more severe it is.

Sometimes other conditions can causeÂ high BNP levels. These include:

    * Kidney failure
    * Pulmonary embolism
    * Pulmonary hypertension
    * Severe infection (sepsis) 
    * Lung problems

## Risks

Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:

    * Excessive bleeding
    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) 

## Considerations

A related test, called the N-terminal pro-BNP test, is done in the same way.
It provides similar information, but the normal range is different.
