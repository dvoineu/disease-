## Summary

A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene. A
variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene.
Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.

Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations
caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are
inherited, which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down
through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic
changes and other outside factors.

Some examples of genetic brain disorders include

  * Leukodystrophies
  * Phenylketonuria
  * Tay-Sachs disease
  * Wilson disease

Many people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain
proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders
can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have
treatments to control symptoms. Some are life-threatening.
