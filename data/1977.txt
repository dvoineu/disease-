## Summary

Of the 206 bones in your body, three of them are in your arm: the humerus,
radius, and ulna. Your arms are also made up of muscles, joints, tendons, and
other connective tissue. Injuries to any of these parts of the arm can occur
during sports, a fall, or an accident.

Types of arm injuries include

    * Tendinitis and bursitis
    * Sprains
    * Dislocations
    * Fractures (broken bones)
    * Nerve problems
    * Osteoarthritis

You may also have problems or injure specific parts of your arm, such as your
hand, wrist, elbow, or shoulder.
