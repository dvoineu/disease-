## Summary

Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that damages your nervous system.
The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle
movement in your arms and legs. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5
and 15. The main symptom is ataxia, which means trouble coordinating
movements. Specific symptoms include

    * Difficulty walking
    * Muscle weakness
    * Speech problems
    * Involuntary eye movements
    * Scoliosis (curving of the spine to one side)
    * Heart palpitations, from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich's ataxia

People with Friedreich's ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after
symptoms first appear. In severe cases, people become incapacitated. There is
no cure. You can treat symptoms with medicines, braces, surgery, and physical
therapy.
