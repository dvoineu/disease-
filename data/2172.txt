## Summary

Almost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature, or
preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks
of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.

Important growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in
the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early, preemies weigh
much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their
organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too
early may have include

    * Breathing problems
    * Feeding difficulties
    * Cerebral palsy
    * Developmental delay
    * Vision problems
    * Hearing problems

Preemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.
They stay there until their organ systems can work on their own.
