## Summary

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, degenerative brain disorder.
Symptoms usually start around age 60. Memory problems, behavior changes,
vision problems, and poor muscle coordination progress quickly to dementia,
coma, and death. Most patients die within a year.

The three main categories of CJD are

  * Sporadic CJD, which occurs for no known reason 
  * Hereditary CJD, which runs in families
  * Acquired CJD, which occurs from contact with infected tissue, usually during a medical procedure

Cattle can get a disease related to CJD called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease." There is concern that people can
get a variant of CJD from eating beef from an infected animal, but there is no
direct proof to support this.
