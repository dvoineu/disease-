This user guide focuses on how comprehensive tobacco control programs can
promote cessation through population-wide efforts. According to _Best
Practices 2014_ , "encouraging and helping tobacco users to quit is the
quickest approach to reducing tobacco-related disease, death, and healthcare
costs." Population-based interventions can dramatically increase access to
proven cessation treatment and help more people quit for good. This guide
offers program staff and partners information on how to promote health systems
change, improve insurance coverage for cessation treatment, and support state
quitlines.
