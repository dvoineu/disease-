## Summary

Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink, your eyelids spread
moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off
the surface of the eye. You close your eyelids when you see something coming
toward your eyes. This can help protect against injuries.

Like most other parts of your body, your eyelids can get infected, inflamed,
or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems, including

  * Eyelids that turn in or out
  * Eyelids that droop
  * Abnormal blinking or twitching

Treatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause.
