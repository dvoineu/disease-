Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola
Virus Disease (EVD) in U.S. Hospitals.

Page Summary

 **Who this is for** : Healthcare personnel in any hospitals. The guidance is
most relevant for hospital staff caring for a patient under investigation
(PUI) or patient with confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD).

**What this is for** : Guidance to help healthcare personnel follow standard,
contact, and droplet precautions when caring for a PUI or patient with
confirmed EVD.

**How this relates to other Ebola guidance** : On August 1, 2014, CDC released
Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients
Under Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in U.S. Hospitals.

Ebola viruses are transmitted through direct contact with infected blood or
body fluids/substances (urine, feces, vomit) or through exposure to objects
(such as needles) that have been contaminated with infected blood or body
fluids. The role of the environment in transmission has not been established.
Limited laboratory studies under favorable conditions indicate that Ebola
virus can remain viable on solid surfaces, with concentrations falling slowly
over several days.1, 2 In the only study to assess contamination of the
patient care environment during an outbreak, Ebola virus was not detected in
any of 33 samples collected from sites that were not visibly bloody. However,
virus was detected on a blood-stained glove and bloody intravenous insertion
site.3 There is no epidemiologic evidence of Ebola virus transmission via
either the environment or fomites that could become contaminated during
patient care (bed rails, door knobs, laundry). However, given the apparent low
infectious dose, potential of high virus titers in the blood of ill patients,
and disease severity, higher levels of precaution are warranted to reduce the
potential risk posed by contaminated surfaces in the patient care environment.

As part of the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed EVD, hospitals are
recommended to

Be sure staff are instructed in the proper use of PPE including safe removal to prevent contaminating themselves or others in the process, and that contaminated equipment is disposed of appropriately (see question 8).

Although there are no products with specific label claims against the Ebola virus, enveloped viruses such as Ebola are susceptible to a broad range of hospital disinfectants used to disinfect hard, non-porous surfaces. In contrast, nonenveloped viruses are more resistant to disinfectants. **As a precaution, selection of a disinfectant product with a higher potency than what is normally required for an enveloped virus is being recommended at this time**. EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims against non-enveloped viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) are broadly antiviral and capable of inactivating both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. How can I determine whether a particular EPA-registered hospital
disinfectant is appropriate for use in the room of a PUI or patient with
confirmed EVD?

Check EPA's Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virusexternal icon for a
list of EPA-registered disinfectants. Users should be aware that an
"enveloped' or 'nonenveloped virus" designation may not be included on the
container label. Instead check the disinfectant's label for at least one of
the common non-enveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus,
poliovirus).

### 2\. Are there special instructions for cleaning and disinfecting the room
of a PUI or patient with confirmed EVD?

Daily cleaning and disinfection of hard, nonporous surfaces (high-touch
surfaces such as bed rails and over bed tables, housekeeping surfaces such as
floors and counters) should be done.4 Before disinfecting a surface, cleaning
should be performed. In contrast to disinfection where products with specific
claims are used, any cleaning product can be used for cleaning tasks. Use
cleaning and disinfecting products according to label instructions. Check the
disinfectant's label for specific instructions for inactivation of any of the
nonenveloped viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) and follow
label instructions for use of the product that are specific for inactivation
of that virus. Use disposable cleaning cloths, mop cloths, and wipes, and
dispose of these in leakproof bags. Use a rigid waste receptacle designed to
support the bag to help minimize contamination of the bag's exterior.

### 3\. How should spills of blood or other body substances be managed?

The basic principles for blood or body substance spill management are outlined
in the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Bloodborne Pathogen Standardsexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.1030).5 CDC guidelines
recommend removal of bulk spill matter, cleaning the site, and then
disinfecting the site.4 For large spills, a chemical disinfectant with
sufficient potency is needed to overcome the tendency of proteins in blood and
other body substances to neutralize the disinfectant's active ingredient. An
EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with label claims for non-enveloped
viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) and instructions for
cleaning and decontaminating surfaces or objects soiled with blood or body
fluids should be used according to those instructions.

### 4\. How should disposable materials (any single-use PPE, cleaning cloths,
wipes, single-use microfiber cloths, linens, food service) and linens, privacy
curtains, and other textiles be managed after their use in the patient room?

These materials should be placed in leakproof containment and discarded
appropriately. To minimize contamination of the exterior of the waste bag,
place the bag in a rigid waste receptacle designed for this use. Incineration
or autoclaving as a waste treatment process is effective in eliminating viral
infectivity and provides waste minimization. If disposal requires transport
offsite then this should be done in accordance with the U.S. Department of
Transportation's (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR, 49 CFR, Parts
171-180).6, 7 Guidance from DOT has been released for Ebola.7

### 5\. Is it safe for patients with EVD to use the bathroom?

Yes. Sanitary sewers may be used for the safe disposal of patient waste.8
Additionally, sewage handling processes in the United States are designed to
inactivate infectious agents.

### 6\. How long does the Ebola virus persist in indoor environments?

Only one laboratory study has been reported, which was done under
environmental conditions that favor virus persistence. This study found that
under these ideal conditions, Ebola virus could remain active for up to six
days.1 In a follow-up study, Ebola virus was found, relative to other
enveloped viruses, to be quite sensitive to inactivation by ultraviolet light
and drying; yet subpopulations did persist in organic debris.2

In the only study to assess contamination of the patient care environment
during an outbreak, conducted in an African hospital under "real-world
conditions," Ebola virus was not detected by either nucleic acid amplification
or culture in any of 33 samples collected from sites that were not visibly
bloody. Virus was detected on a blood-stained glove and bloody intravenous
insertion site by nucleic acid amplification, which may detect nonviable
virus, but not by culture for live, infectious virus.3 Based upon these data
and what is known regarding the environmental infection control of other
enveloped RNA viruses, the expectation is that with consistent daily cleaning
and disinfection practices in U.S. hospitals, the persistence of Ebola virus
in the patient care environment would be short, with 24 hours3 considered a
cautious upper limit.

### 7\. Are wastes generated during delivery of care to patients with EVD
subject to select agent regulations?

As long as facilities treating patients with EVD follow CDC's Infection
Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients Under
Investigation (PUIs) for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in U.S. Hospitals , waste
generated during delivery of care to patients with Ebola would not be subject
to federal select agent regulations (See the exclusion provision 42 CFR §
73.3(d)(1)). However, this would not apply to any facility that intentionally
collected or otherwise extracted Ebola virus from waste generated during the
delivery of patient care.

###  8\. Are wastes generated during delivery of care to patients with EVD
subject to any special transportation requirements?

Yes, wastes contaminated or suspected to be contaminated with Ebola virus must
be packaged and transported in accordance with U.S. DOT Hazardous Materials
Regulations (HMR, 49 CFR, Parts 171-180).6, 7

Once a PUI is no longer suspected to have EVD or has been ruled out for EVD,
their waste materials no longer need to be managed as if contaminated with
