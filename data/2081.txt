## Summary

If you take a medicine in a way that is different from what the doctor
prescribed, it is called prescription drug misuse. It could be

    * Taking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else
    * Taking a larger dose than you are supposed to
    * Taking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. This might be crushing tablets and then snorting or injecting them.
    * Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high

Misusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include opioids,
sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants.

Every medicine has some risk of side effects. Doctors take this into account
when prescribing medicines. People who misuse these drugs may not understand
the risks. The medicines may not be safe for them, especially at higher doses
or when taken with other medicines.
