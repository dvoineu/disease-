## Summary

Coughing is a reflex that keeps your throat and airways clear. Although it can
be annoying, coughing helps your body heal or protect itself. Coughs can be
either acute or chronic. Acute coughs begin suddenly and usually last no more
than 2 to 3 weeks. Acute coughs are the kind you most often get with a cold,
flu, or acute bronchitis. Chronic coughs last longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Causes
of chronic cough include

    * Chronic bronchitis
    * Asthma
    * Allergies
    * COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
    * GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) 
    * Smoking
    * Throat disorders, such as croup in young children
    * Some medicines 

Water can help ease your cough - whether you drink it or add it to the air
with a steamy shower or vaporizer. If you have a cold or the flu,
antihistamines may work better than non-prescription cough medicines. Children
under four should not have cough medicine. For children over four, use caution
and read labels carefully.
