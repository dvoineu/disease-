*Data are provisional and might not reflect the actual number of Zika virus disease cases due to delays in reporting.

†Excludes congenital disease cases.

**These presumed locally acquired cases of Zika in the U.S. territories were
diagnosed using serologic testing, which detects antibodies against Zika.
Since antibodies against Zika can persist for years after infection, serology
cannot distinguish between a recent or past infection. Additionally, Zika and
dengue virus antibodies cross-react, making it difficult to diagnose which
virus is the cause of the current illness. None of these probable cases have
tested positive using molecular testing, which detects the presence of the
virus in the body and is the best indicator of a recent infection. In 2019,
there have been no confirmed Zika virus disease cases reported from U.S.
territories. Additionally, a large number of suspect Zika cases from the
territories have been tested using molecular testing and none have been
positive.  

‡Sexually transmitted cases are not reported for US territories because with
local transmission of Zika virus it is not possible to determine whether
infection occurred due to mosquito-borne or sexual transmission.

*Includes reported confirmed and probable Zika virus disease cases per the CSTE case definitions.

†Presumptive viremic blood donors are people who reported no symptoms at the
time of donating blood, but whose blood tested positive when screened for the
presence of Zika virus RNA by the blood collection agency. Some presumptive
viremic blood donors develop symptoms after their donation or may have had
symptoms in the past.  These individuals may be reported as both Zika virus
disease cases and presumptive viremic blood donors.
