## Summary

Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities, such as
balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Many of these
diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as
alcoholism, a tumor, or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins, chemicals,
and viruses. Sometimes the cause is unknown.

Degenerative nerve diseases include

    * Alzheimer's disease
    * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
    * Friedreich's ataxia
    * Huntington's disease
    * Lewy body disease
    * Parkinson's disease
    * Spinal muscular atrophy

Degenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on
the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms,
relieve pain, and increase mobility.
