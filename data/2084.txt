## Summary

The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers that carry
visual messages. You have one connecting the back of each eye (your retina) to
your brain. Damage to an optic nerve can cause vision loss. The type of vision
loss and how severe it is depends on where the damage occurs. It may affect
one or both eyes.

There are many different types of optic nerve disorders, including:

    * Glaucoma is a group of diseases that are the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises and damages the optic nerve.
    * Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Causes include infections and immune-related illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
    * Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. Causes include poor blood flow to the eye, disease, trauma, or exposure to toxic substances.
    * Optic nerve head drusen are pockets of protein and calcium salts that build up in the optic nerve over time

Contact your health care provider if you are having vision problems. Tests for
optic nerve disorders may include eye exams, ophthalmoscopy (an examination of
the back of your eye), and imaging tests. Treatment depends on which disorder
that you have. With some optic nerve disorders, you may get your vision back.
With others, there is no treatment, or treatment may only prevent further
vision loss.
