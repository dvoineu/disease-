## Summary

Prenatal care is the health care you get while you are pregnant. It includes
your checkups and prenatal testing. Prenatal care can help keep you and your
baby healthy. It lets your health care provider spot health problems early.
Early treatment can cure many problems and prevent others.

Your doctor or midwife will give you a schedule for your prenatal visits. If
you are over 35 years old or your pregnancy is high risk because of health
problems like diabetes or high blood pressure, your doctor or midwife will
probably want to see you more often. You can also expect to see your health
care provider more often as your due date gets closer.
