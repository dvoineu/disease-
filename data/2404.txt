# What causes bone loss?

Osteoporosis, or bone loss, is a disease that causes bones to become brittle
and more likely to fracture (break). With osteoporosis, the bones lose
density. Bone density is the amount of bone tissue that is in your bones.

A diagnosis of osteoporosis means you are at risk for bone fractures even if
you do not have a severe bone injury.

## Your Changing Bones

Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy
bones.

    * During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone. Your entire skeleton is replaced about every 10 years, though this process slows as you get older.
    * As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.
    * Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.

Sometimes bone loss occurs without any known cause. Some bone loss with aging
is normal for everyone. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families
and the disease is inherited. In general, white, older women are the most
likely to have bone loss. This increases their risk of breaking a bone.

Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body destroy
too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough bone.

Weak bones can break easily, even without an obvious injury.

## Aging and Bone Loss

As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones
instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.
When this process reaches a certain stage, it is called osteoporosis.

Many times, a person will fracture a bone before they even know they have bone
loss. By the time a fracture occurs, the bone loss is serious.

Women over age 50 years and men over age 70 years have a higher risk for
osteoporosis than younger women and men.

    * For women, a drop in estrogen at the time of menopause is a major cause of bone loss.
    * For men, a drop in testosterone as they age can cause bone loss. 

## Your Lifestyle and Bone Loss

Your body needs calcium and vitamin D and enough exercise to build and keep
strong bones.

Your body may not make enough new bone if:

    * You do not eat enough high-calcium foods
    * Your body does not absorb enough calcium from the foods you eat
    * Your body removes more calcium than normal in the urine 

Certain habits can affect your bones.

    *  **Drinking alcohol.** Too much alcohol can damage your bones. It can also put you at risk of falling and breaking a bone.
    *  **Smoking.** Men and women who smoke have weaker bones. Women who smoke after menopause have an even higher chance of fractures. 

Younger women who do not have menstrual periods for a long time also have a
higher risk of bone loss and osteoporosis.

Low body weight is linked to less bone mass and weaker bones.

Exercise is linked to higher bone mass and stronger bones.

## Medical Disorders and Bone Loss

Many long-term (chronic) medical conditions can keep people confined to a bed
or chair.

    * This keeps the muscles and bones in their hips and spines from being used or bearing any weight.
    * Not being able to walk or exercise may lead to bone loss and fractures. 

Other medical conditions that may also lead to bone loss are:

    * Rheumatoid arthritis
    * Long-term (chronic) kidney disease
    * Overactive parathyroid gland
    * Diabetes, most often type 1 diabetes
    * Organ transplant 

Sometimes, medicines that treat certain medical conditions can cause
osteoporosis. Some of these are:

    * Hormone-blocking treatments for prostate cancer or breast cancer
    * Some medicines that are used to treat seizures or epilepsy
    * Glucocorticoid (steroid) medicines, if they are taken by mouth every day for more than 3 months, or are taken several times a year 

Any treatment or condition that causes calcium or vitamin D to be poorly
absorbed can also lead to weak bones. Some of these are:

    * Gastric bypass (weight-loss surgery)
    * Cystic fibrosis
    * Other conditions that prevent the small intestine from absorbing nutrients well 

People with eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, are also at higher
risk for osteoporosis.

## What's Next?

Talk to your health care provider about your risk for bone loss and
osteoporosis. Find out how to get the right amount of calcium and vitamin D,
what exercise or lifestyle changes are right for you, and what medicines you
may need to take.
