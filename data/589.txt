## Summary

Your legs are made up of bones, blood vessels, muscles, and other connective
tissue. They are important for motion and standing. Playing sports, running,
falling, or having an accident can damage your legs. Common leg injuries
include sprains and strains, joint dislocations, and fractures (broken bones).

These injuries can affect the entire leg, or just the foot, ankle, knee, or
hip. Certain diseases also lead to leg problems. For example, knee
osteoarthritis, common in older people, can cause pain and limited motion.
Problems in your veins in your legs can lead to varicose veins or deep vein
thrombosis.
