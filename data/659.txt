## Summary

A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature
can vary from person to person, but it is usually around 98.6 F. A fever is
not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an
illness or infection.

Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to
kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria
and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you
have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your
body's immune system.

Other causes of fevers include

    * Medicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicines
    * Heat illness
    * Cancers
    * Autoimmune diseases
    * Some childhood immunizations

Treatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high, your
health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as
acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with
fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids,
to prevent dehydration.
