Also called: Accident prevention

## Summary

You can't remove all the safety hazards from your life, but you can reduce
them. To avoid many major hazards and prepare for emergencies

    * Keep emergency phone numbers by your telephones
    * Make a first aid kit for your home
    * Make a family emergency plan
    * Install and maintain smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors
    * Keep guns unloaded and locked up. Lock up the ammunition separately.

Young children are especially at risk. Supervision is the best way to keep
them safe. Childproofing the house can also help.
