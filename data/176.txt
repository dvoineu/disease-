## Summary

An herb is a plant or plant part used for its scent, flavor, or therapeutic
properties. Herbal medicines are one type of dietary supplement. They are sold
as tablets, capsules, powders, teas, extracts, and fresh or dried plants.
People use herbal medicines to try to maintain or improve their health.

Many people believe that products labeled "natural" are always safe and good
for them. This is not necessarily true. Herbal medicines do not have to go
through the testing that drugs do. Some herbs, such as comfrey and ephedra,
can cause serious harm. Some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-
counter medicines.

If you are thinking about using an herbal medicine, first get information on
it from reliable sources. Make sure to tell your health care provider about
any herbal medicines you are taking.
