The CDC Import Permit Program, or IPP, regulates the importation of infectious
biological materials that could cause disease in humans in order to prevent
their introduction and spread into the U.S. The program ensures that the
importation of these agents is monitored and that facilities receiving permits
have appropriate biosafety measures in place to work with the imported agents.

Materials requiring import permits include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Infectious biological agents capable of causing illness in humans

Regulatory authority for the program is given to the Secretary of Health and
Human Services through the Public Health Service Act, which allows for the
development and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction,
transmission, or spread of communicable disease from foreign countries into
and throughout the U.S. or its possessions. The regulations  (42 CFR § 71.54)
require that anyone wishing to import infectious biological agents, infectious
substances, or vectors must first obtain a permit issued by CDC.

For instructions on how to apply for an import permit, click here. Note that
an inspection may be conducted before a permit is issued, in order to ensure
the applicant's facility has appropriate measures in place to minimize the
accidental release of biological agents capable of causing human disease.
