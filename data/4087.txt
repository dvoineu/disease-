Asthma control is based on the most impaired level across four components or
variables. Control classification is dichotomized into "well controlled"
versus "not well controlled/very poorly controlled." This is a simplification
of the NAEPP Guideline (EPR-3) control categories where "not well controlled"
and "very poorly controlled" are separate categories.

**Components of asthma control:**

_Symptoms:_ "During the past 30 days, on how many days did [child's name] have
any symptoms of asthma? (SYMP_30D)"  
_Nighttime awakenings:_  
"During the past 30 days, on how many days did symptoms of asthma make it
difficult for [him/her] to stay asleep? (ASLEEP30)"  
_Interference with normal activity:_ "During just the past 30 days, would you
say [child's name] limited [his/her] usual activities due to asthma not at
all, a little, a moderate amount, or a lot? (ACT_DAYS30 )" _Note: the recall
period for this question changed in the ACBS from "12 months" to "30 days" in
2012._  
_Short-acting beta agonist use:_ Requires an algorithm using responses from 4
questions:  
"In the past 3 months has [child's name] taken prescription asthma medicine
using an inhaler? (INH_SCR)"  
"How many times per day or per week does [he/she] use [MEDICATION FROM
INH_MEDS SERIES]1? (ILP08_#)"  
"In the past 3 months, did [he/she] take [MEDICATION FROM INH_MEDS SERIES]1
when [he/she] had an asthma episode or attack? (ILP04_#)"  
"In the past 3 months, did [he/she] take [MEDICATION FROM INH_MEDS SERIES]1
before exercising? (ILP05_#)"

* * *

1INH_MEDS series is a list of medications which the interviewer uses to
identify up to 8 medications reported by the respondent. This list should be
checked in the ACBS documentation each year for updates. In 2012, it included
the following SABA medications: albuterol (Ventolin, Proair HFA, Proventil),
bitolterol (Tornalate), levalbuterol (Xopenex), metaproterenol (Alupent),
pirbuterol (Maxair), salbutamol (albuterol), and terbutaline (Brethaire).

**Overall classification of asthma control across 4 components:**

Code control for each of the indices below (Symptoms, Nighttime Awakenings,
and SABA Use) into 4 separate variables. Then create a control variable based
on the most impaired level across the 4.

**Table 1**

![Asthma Control:  Table
1](/asthma/asthma_disparities/images/control_table1.jpg)

1= Well Controlled  
2= Not Well/Very Poorly Controlled  
Assign missing value for CONTROL_SCORE when 2 or more components have missing
data (scenarios E and G in Table 1)

**Categorizing asthma symptoms (Control_1)**

**BRFS Call Back item used: SYMP_30D**  
SYMP_30D question wording: "During the past 30 days, on how many days did
[child's name] have any symptoms of asthma?"  
Level of control for this index is determined the same way for all 3 age
pediatric groups. They are left stratified in Table 2 to demonstrate
differences in the EPR-3 Guidelines by age group.

**Table 2**

![Asthma Control: Table
2](/asthma/asthma_disparities/images/control_table2.jpg)

*** Cannot be measured since we don't have the number of times per day asthma
symptoms were experienced  
Exclude responses SYMP_30D=77 or 99 (don't know or refused to answer)

_CUT POINT DETERMINATION_  
**SYMP_30D:** measures # days the respondent had symptoms in the past 30 days.
The following demonstrates how the cut points in the table above were derived
for all age groups above:

Note: 88=code for no days  
Exclude responses ASLEEP30=77 or 99 (don't know or refused to answer)

_CUT POINT DETERMINATION_  
**ASLEEP30:** measures # days the respondent had difficulty staying asleep in
the past 30 days due to asthma symptoms. The following demonstrates how the
cut points in the table above were derived:

little, a moderate amount, or a lot?"  
Note: the recall period for this question changed in the ACBS from "12 months"
to "30 days" in 2012.

For this component of asthma control, the EPR-3 Guidelines are the same for
all pediatric age groups:

![For this component of asthma control, the EPR-3 Guidelines are the same for

Identify those medications that are inhaled SABA (INH_MEDS: 3, 4, 9, 10, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 30, 33, 37, 38, 41. These are SABA inhalers.). This determination needs annual update because new inhaled medications may be added to the survey. This list should be checked in the ACBS documentation each year for updates. In 2012, it included the following SABA medications: albuterol (Ventolin, Proair HFA, Proventil), bitolterol (Tornalate), Combivent, levalbuterol (Xopenex), metaproterenol (Alupent), pirbuterol (Maxair), salbutamol (albuterol), and terbutaline (Brethaire). Limitation: This indicator ONLY includes SABA medications taken by inhaler since the frequency of SABAs taken in some other form (including nebulizer) is not captured on the survey. Therefore, control assessed by SABA use will be an underestimate and may pose a severe limitation, especially to the 0-4 year olds.

Determine which SABA medications where there is evidence that they were taken in the past 3 months only for treatment before exercise. For responses consistent with SABA use only before exercise, exclude from SABA total use according to Table 9.

Then determine the frequency of use (ILP08) for the remaining responses and convert all to # times per day.
