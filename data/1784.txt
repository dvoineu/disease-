## Summary

Each of your feet has 26 bones, 33 joints, and more than 100 tendons, muscles,
and ligaments. No wonder a lot of things can go wrong. Here are a few common
problems:

    * Bunions \- hard, painful bumps on the big toe joint
    * Corns and calluses \- thickened skin from friction or pressure
    * Plantar warts - warts on the soles of your feet
    * Fallen arches - also called flat feet 

Ill-fitting shoes often cause these problems. Aging and being overweight also
increase your chances of having foot problems.
