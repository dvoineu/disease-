Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) is caused by Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV),
a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. OHF was described between 1945 and
1947 in Omsk, Russia from patients with hemorrhagic fever.

Rodents serve as the primary host for OHFV, which is transmitted to rodents
from the bite of an infected tick. Common tick vectors include _Dermacentor
reticulatus_ , _Dermacentor marginatus_ , _Ixodes persulcatus_ and common
rodents infected with OHFV include the muskrat ( _Ondatra zibethica_ ), water
vole ( _Arvicola terrestris_ ), and narrow-skulled voles ( _Microtus gregalis_
). Muskrats are not native to the Omsk region but were introduced to the area
and are now a common target for hunters and trappers. When infected with the
virus, muskrats can become ill and die.

OHF occurs in the western Siberia regions of Omsk, Novosibirsk, Kurgan and
Tyumen.

Transmission

Humans can become infected through direct tick or rodent exposure...

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms may appear after 3-8 days after exposure to OHFV...

Risk of Exposure

People with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor
settings...

Diagnosis

OHF virus may be detected in blood samples by virus isolation in cell
culture...

Treatment

There is no specific treatment for OHF, but supportive therapy is important...

Prevention

Utilizing insect repellents and wearing protective clothing is recommended...
