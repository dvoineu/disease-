## What are tumor marker tests?

These tests look for tumor markers, sometimes called cancer markers, in the
blood, urine, or body tissues. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer
cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body. Some tumor markers
are specific to one type of cancer. Others can be found in several types of
cancers.

Because tumor markers can also show up in certain noncancerous conditions,
tumor marker tests are not usually used to diagnose cancer or screen people at
low risk of the disease. These tests are most often done on people already
diagnosed with cancer. Tumor markers can help find out if your cancer has
spread, whether your treatment is working, or if your cancer has come back
after you've finished treatment.

## What are they used for?

Tumor marker tests are most often used to:

    * Plan your treatment. If tumor marker levels go down, it usually means the treatment is working.
    * Help find out if a cancer has spread to other tissues
    * Help predict the likely outcome or course of your disease
    * Check to see if your cancer has come back after successful treatment
    * Screen people at high risk for cancer. Risk factors can include family history and previous diagnosis of another type of cancer

## Why do I need a tumor marker test?

You may need a tumor marker test if you are currently being treated for
cancer, have finished cancer treatment, or have a high risk of getting cancer
because of family history or other reasons.

The type of test you get will depend on your health, health history, and
symptoms you may have. Below are some of the most common types of tumor
markers and what they are used for.

CA 125 (cancer antigen 125)  
---  
**Tumor marker for:** | ovarian cancer  
**Used to:** |

    * See if cancer treatment is working
    * See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment  
  
  
CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 (cancer antigens 15-3 and 27-29)  
---  
**Tumor markers for:** | breast cancer  
**Used to:** | Monitor treatment in women with advanced breast cancer  
  
  
PSA (prostate-specific antigen)  
---  
**Tumor marker for:** | prostate cancer  
**Used to:** |

    * Screen for prostate cancer
    * Help diagnose prostate cancer
    * Monitor treatment
    * Check to see if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment  
  
  
CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)  
---  
**Tumor marker for:** | colorectal cancer, and also for cancers of the lung,
stomach, thyroid, pancreas, breast, and ovary  
**Used to:** |

    * See if cancer treatment is working
    * See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment  
  
  
AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein)  
---  
**Tumor marker for:** | liver cancer, and cancers of the ovary or testicles  
**Used to:** |

    * Help diagnose liver cancer
    * Find out if cancer has spread (the stage of cancer)
    * See if cancer treatment is working
    * Predict chances for recovery  
  
  
B2M (Beta 2-microglobulin)  
---  
**Tumor marker for:** | multiple myeloma, some lymphomas, and leukemias  
**Used to:** |

    * See if cancer treatment is working
    * Predict chances for recovery  
  
  

## What happens during a tumor marker test?

There are different ways to test for tumor markers. Blood tests are the most
common type of tumor marker tests. Urine tests or biopsies may also be used to
check for tumor markers. A biopsy is a minor procedure that involves removing
a small piece of tissue for testing.

**If you are getting a blood test,** a health care professional will take a
blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle
is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or
vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually
takes less than five minutes.

**If you are getting a urine test,** ask your health care provider for
instructions on how to provide your sample.

**If you are getting a biopsy,** a health care provider will take out a small
piece of tissue by cutting or scraping the skin. If your provider needs to
test tissue from inside your body, he or she may use a special needle to
withdraw the sample.

## Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood or urine test. If
you are getting a biopsy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several
hours before the procedure. Talk to your health care provider if you have any
questions about preparing for your test.

## Are there any risks to the test?

There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or
bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away
quickly.

There is no risk to a urine test.

If you have had a biopsy, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at biopsy
site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.

## What do the results mean?

Depending in what type of test you had and how it was used, your results may:

    * Help diagnose the type or stage of your cancer.
    * Show whether your cancer treatment is working.
    * Help plan future treatment.
    * Show if your cancer has returned after you've finished treatment.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, and understanding
results.

## Is there anything else I need to know about tumor marker tests?

Tumor markers can be very useful, but the information they provide can be
limited because:

    * Some noncancerous conditions can cause tumor markers.
    * Some people with cancer don't have tumor markers.
    * Not all types of cancer have tumor markers.

So, tumor markers are almost always used with other tests to help diagnose and
monitor cancer.
