# COVID-19 Funding for Tribes

Minus

Related Pages

On March 6, 2020, the President signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and
Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-123). This bill
provides $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to
the coronavirus pandemic. Of this funding, $950 million is specifically
directed for grants or cooperative agreements to states, localities,
territories, and tribes, no less than $40 million of which shall be allocated
to tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian health organizations, or health
service providers to tribes.

CDC is taking a multifaceted approach to allocate COVID-19 funding to Indian
Country. This approach aims to get public health resources out quickly during
this declared emergency and enable broad access to the opportunity for
COVID-19 resources across all tribal nations. This approach also must reflect
the statutory requirements of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020.

CDC's Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support (CSTLTS) is
coordinating the following funding opportunities to expedite the release of
COVID-19 response resources to support tribal communities:

**Noncompetitive Grant: Supporting Tribal Public Health Capacity in
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (CDC-RFA-OT20-2004) external icon**

This emergency funding opportunity is designed to fund federally recognized
tribes that contract or compact with the Indian Health Service under Title I
and Title V of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, or
consortia of these tribes, or their bona fide agents. All federally recognized
tribes, tribal organizations, consortia of federally recognized tribes, or
their bona fide agents should apply for this announcement to be considered for
future funding under this announcement. During a national emergency, these
organizations are uniquely positioned to provide emergency preparedness and
response support for tribal health departments and other components of the
tribal public health system.
