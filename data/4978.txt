##  Executive Summary

This report summarizes the comments, suggestions, and recommendations of a
working group convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
on assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) outcomes in children and youth.
It is intended for researchers, public health professionals--including those
from state health departments--and advocates interested in furthering research
on outcomes of TBI in children.

TBI is often described as the leading cause of disability in children, but
data to support this assertion are lacking. We know that each year an
estimated 3,000 children and youth die from TBI; 29,000 are hospitalized; and
400,000 are treated in hospital emergency departments. Currently, no
population-based studies of the outcomes of TBI among children and youth exist
to provide national estimates of TBI-related disability and document the need
for services.

On October 26 and 27, 2000, the National Center for Injury Prevention and
Control at the CDC held a meeting of researchers, advocates and other
professionals from the U.S. and New Zealand to discuss "Methodological Issues
in Assessing Outcomes of TBI in Children and Youth." The primary purpose of
this meeting was to determine the feasibility and appropriate methods for
conducting population-based follow-up studies of outcomes of TBI in children
and youth.

Meeting participants identified key research topics and variables to measure
in assessing longer-term outcomes of TBI in children and youth (ages 0-16
years). They reviewed several conceptual models of disability, including the
Institute of Medicine Model and the World Health Organization Model, that
could provide a framework for designing appropriate studies of TBI outcomes.
They also discussed the advantages and shortcomings of available measures for
assessing these outcomes. Finally, the working group described the challenges
in designing and implementing studies on TBI in children and youth and
recommended ways to address those challenges.

Meeting participants recommended that further research be done to examine
physiological responses to brain injury, patterns of recovery and treatment
and costs of TBI. The group suggested that the field needs to explore the
applicability of various types of research, including qualitative research.
Some examples suggested included focus groups and individual interviews.
Meeting participants also recommended methods for improving measurement, data
analysis and terminology used in the study of TBI.

### Meeting Participants and Process

The eleven participants included researchers, advocates, psychologists,
educators and other professionals from the United States and New Zealand. With
input from the Brain Injury Association, CDC selected invitees for their
potential to contribute to a greater understanding of the important outcomes
of TBI in children that need to be studied or the methods appropriate for
collecting information about those outcomes. Two of the participants are the
developers of key measures of health status in children.

For each objective, CDC staff prepared background materials for discussion;
selected meeting participants assisted in these preparations. The meeting
began with presentations of preliminary CDC multi-state surveillance data and
South Carolina surveillance data to provide background information on the
importance of TBI among children and youth as a public health problem (See
Appendix B and Appendix C). For the remainder of the first day, participants
discussed the background materials. A professional note taker recorded
participants' comments and suggestions. On the second day, the moderator
presented a synthesis of the suggestions for review and revision by the
participants.

This report documents the final summary of the comments and recommendations.
For some sections, more detailed definitions, references and other materials
have been added to clarify the information from the meeting.

*** CDC Wonder

TBI is reported to be the leading cause of disability in young people in the
U.S., but the evidence is limited. Most studies of the outcomes of TBI in
children and youth are based on case series from selected hospitals or
rehabilitation facilities, small regional samples or anecdotal reports. Few
studies have followed the same group of children over time. (See Appendix B
for additional statistics on TBI in children and youth.)

### The Need for More Research

Population-based longitudinal studies provide data representative of the long-
term outcomes of all children and youth in a defined area who have had a TBI.
They are necessary to allow generalization to the U.S. population of children
and youth with TBI. Currently no population-based studies of the outcomes of
TBI among children and youth exist to provide national estimates of TBI-
related disability and to document the need for services.

CDC has funded such studies, referred to as "follow-up studies" or "outcomes
surveillance," of older adolescents and adults (ages 15 years and older) in
two states, South Carolina and Colorado. In each of these studies, a sample of
people hospitalized with a TBI is identified and given a telephone
questionnaire at yearly intervals to find out about TBI outcomes, including
disability. For more information about CDC-funded TBI studies, see Appendix E.
When the first of these studies was initiated in 1994, children were not
included, in part, because few measures were available. The difficulty of
measuring the effects of the injury in the context of naturally occurring
developmental changes contributes to the challenge of assessing outcomes of
TBI in young people.

The Brain Injury Association, the Federal Advisory Committee for Injury
Prevention and Control and a wide range of researchers and other professionals
in the field have long argued for a population-based follow-up study of
outcomes of TBI in children. In its October 2000 reauthorization of the TBI
Act of 1996, Congress emphasized the need for CDC to support TBI studies among
all age groups. This meeting was conducted to obtain advice regarding the
feasibility of conducting a CDC-funded study of TBI outcomes in children and
youth.

### A Note about Terminology

**Child vs. Pediatric** : Meeting participants advocated using the term child
because pediatric is associated with the medical model. Reference to child
encourages consideration of broader, longer-term issues, not only medical
concerns. Researchers and professionals should avoid using pediatric
especially when referring to longer-term outcomes of TBI in children.

**Youth vs. Adolescent** : Participants referred to the term youth over
teenagers or adolescents because it is more widely used in educational and
other settings.

**Caregiver vs. Parent** : The term caregiver may be more appropriate than
parent because in many cases the person caring for the child is someone other
than a parent.

##  Designing Studies that Assess Longer-Term TBI Outcomes in Children and
Youth: Conceptual Models, Operational Models and Other Resources  

### Objective

This section provides background information about selection of a conceptual
model and development of an operational model as well as other resources
available to help guide the study design.

### Conceptual Models

Meeting participants mentioned several conceptual models that could provide a
framework for designing appropriate studies of TBI outcomes. It is important
to select an appropriate conceptual model before finalizing an operational
model and selecting specific measures.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Institute of Medicine (IOM) Model**  
The original IOM model links the four main components of the disabling
process-pathology, impairment, functional limitation and disability. The
modified IOM model removes disability from this chain to emphasize that
disability is not an individual characteristic but a result of interaction
between an individual and his or her environment. (Brandt EN Jr., Pope AM,
editors. Enabling America: Assessing the Role of Rehabilitation Science and
Engineering. Washington, DC: National Academy Press; 1997).

This WHO model of disability addresses both the individual factors, including
body systems, impairment, activity, and social participation, and the role of
the environment. The model is still under revision and has not yet been
adapted for children, although work is in progress. Meeting participants
recommended that CDC consider adopting this model, which is being applied to
disability research internationally. (ICIDH-2: International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health Website. Available at: www.who.int/icidh/.

This model assesses the family environment, including structural dimensions
such as family size and family composition, as well as qualitative aspects
such as family stressors, sources of internal and external support, and areas
of strength and need. (Kalesnik, J. Family assessment. In Nutall EV, Romero I,
et al. editors. Assessing and Screening Preschoolers: Psychological and
Educational Dimensions (2nd ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon, Inc; 1999. pp.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Developmental Models**  
A developmental model is a framework that recognizes a wide range of factors
including the intricate matrix of a changing child and environment, evolving
familial and societal expectations, and the link between disrupted and normal
development. (Pynoos RS, Steinberg AM, Wraith R. A developmental model of
childhood traumatic stress. In: Cicchetti E, Cohen DJ, editors. Developmental
Psychopathology. Vol 2: Risk, Disorder, and Adaptation. Wiley series on
personality processes. New York: John Wiley and Sons; 1995. pp. 112-125. Brett
AW, and Laatsch L. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy of brain-injured students
in a public high school setting. Pediatric Rehabilitation 1998;2:27-31.)
Consideration of developmental models is critical in designing studies of
longer-term outcomes of TBI in children so that the studies address not only
the effects of the injury but also how these effects relate to development.

Models of disability (IOM or WHO) are the most useful as overall guides for
the study design. Family systems and developmental models suggest key areas to
be considered for inclusion in the study.

### Operational Models

Operational models are one-page summaries of topics and variables to consider
in planning studies of outcomes of TBI in young people. Meeting participants
reviewed and discussed draft operational models, which were prepared before
the meeting. Figure 1 (General Model) and Figure 2 (Service-Related Model)
show the topics and related variables recommended by the working group.

These topics and variables were suggested by researchers, advocates and
professionals. It is also important to conduct qualitative research, such as
focus groups, with families and children or youth with TBI to understand the
key issues from their perspectives. Minority populations should be included in
qualitative studies to increase understanding of the unique experiences and
service needs of these subpopulations.

To date, studies have focused largely on determinants of secondary conditions
and adverse outcomes, but studies must also be developed to identify factors
related to good outcomes.

### Other Resources

Meeting participants mentioned several other resources that could be used to
guide selection of research priorities. These resources include:

### More About the Domains for Assessing Service Needs

Parents and advocates report that appropriate services for children and youth
with TBI are lacking. Studies of outcomes of TBI among this population should
document the needs for services and the barriers to receiving them. For that
reason, meeting participants developed a separate operational model
specifically for these issues (Figure 2).

For clarification, a more detailed description of some of the important
barriers that were discussed follows below:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Lack of referrals made by healthcare providers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Lack of appropriate educational services; the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) does not meet the child / youth's need or schools may tend to identify conditions they know how to manage. Research is needed to determine whether classifying children as having a TBI affects how they are managed in school.

##  Available Measures for Assessing Outcomes of TBI in Children and Youth

### Objective

This section summarizes existing measures for assessing outcomes and describes
their applicability to studies of TBI.

### Key Criteria

Meeting participants reviewed key criteria for evaluating the usefulness of
currently available measures for assessing outcomes of TBI. These criteria
included:

The majority of measures developed for children aged 5 years or younger are developmental measures not specifically designed for children with TBI. Longitudinal research that applies the appropriate measures at each developmental level, but that also tracks important milestones and late emerging deficits from early childhood through older ages, will be especially challenging.

**Specific Measures** A wide range of child health and other measures are
available. (For tables that summarize the measures, see Appendix A.) However,
not all of these measures are useful or appropriate for studying children and
youth with TBI.

**Key Measures** : The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and the Pediatric
Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI)

Prior to the meeting, participants identified two promising measures for
assessing outcomes of TBI in children and youth, CHQ and the PEDI. The working
group discussed the characteristics of these measures, which are summarized
below.

**_Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ)_**

This summary was presented by Jeanne Landgraf, who developed the measure.

**School Performance Assessments**

Assessments of school performance include achievement tests, which measure
students' academic performance, and school function assessments, which assess
students' ability to behave appropriately in the classroom.

##  Recommendations for Additional Research into TBI in Children and Youth

### Objective

This section summarizes participant recommendations regarding the wide-ranging
needs for additional research and improved research methods in studies of TBI
in children and youth.

**The Need for Qualitative Research**

Qualitative research facilitates an increased understanding of the experiences
of people with TBI, their caregivers, or professionals working with people
with TBI from their own unique and personal perspectives. Such information can
guide the development of informational materials and questionnaires for
epidemiologic studies. Common qualitative research techniques include focus
groups and individual interviews. (See Patton MQ. Qualitative Evaluation and
Research Methods (2nd Ed). Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1990.)

One meeting participant also had experience in conducting in-depth
ethnographic, naturalistic studies with children with other health conditions
(e.g., a study of children with asthma collected data by allowing them to
carry video cameras). Participants recommended exploring the applicability of
these methods to studies of TBI.

**Research Topics**

**Basic**

Basic research addresses physiologic responses to brain injury. Meeting
participants noted that further studies are needed to:

**Patterns of Recovery**

Because recovery after TBI can be lengthy and because the risk of developing
secondary conditions changes over time, better information about patterns of
recovery from TBI is needed to understand the long-term effects of TBI.
Meeting participants noted that further studies are needed to describe:

**Treatment**

The NIH Consensus Conference on the Rehabilitation of Persons with Traumatic
Brain Injury documented the need for improved research on treatment of TBI,

**Costs**

Few studies have looked at the cost of TBI, especially among children. Cost
data can help focus greater attention on a public health problem such as TBI.
Meeting participants noted that further studies are needed to document:

**Issues of Measurement and Data Analysis**

Among the greatest challenges to conducting high-quality research on outcomes
of TBI in children are limitations in existing outcome measures and analytic
approaches as well as the lack of standard terminology to describe the
outcomes. Meeting participants offered the following recommendations to
improve measurement, analysis, and terminology:

##  Other Methodologic Issues in Assessing TBI Outcomes in Children

### Objective

The objective for this section is to review key issues to consider in
conducting studies of TBI outcomes in children and youth.

Meeting participants had a wide range of experiences in obtaining information
from children with TBI, their families and schools. These sections document
participants' ideas about the challenges of designing and implementing a study
of outcomes of TBI in children and youth and how they should be managed.

Considerations for Defining the Study Population

### Degree to which the Study Population Represents the General Population

Meeting participants discussed how representative the study population would
be if children were selected for follow-up using the same approach used in CDC
follow-up studies of older adolescents and adults. That approach, which
identifies cases from surveillance systems using hospital discharge data sets,
has some important limitations:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * It may underestimate problem outcomes because those who can still be identified and followed after one-year post-hospital discharge tend to have more resources and more stable lives (for adults followed in the Colorado follow-up system, about 35% are lost to follow-up within one year).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * It probably does not include an adequate subsample of children from low-income families.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * It does not include children seen in the emergency department (ED) but not admitted to hospital. The majority of children with TBI are seen only in the ED.

**Sampling Frame**

Participants discussed an appropriate sampling frame for selecting cases for
follow-up studies of children. They determined that the sampling frame should
include both children treated and released from the ED and children discharged
from the hospital. The population should then be stratified by severity before
selecting the sample.

**Information from Parents / Caregivers and Schools**

Participants also discussed whether the study should collect information from
parents / caregivers or schools:

Parents and children may differ in reporting, especially about the social experiences of the child, with the parent reporting that the child has more friends and fewer problems with peer interactions than the child reports.

Appropriateness of Telephone Interviews for Children / Youth Follow-up Studies

Instead of using in-person interviewing, which is very expensive, CDC has used
telephone interviewing to collect information in its follow-up studies of
older adolescents and adults. Meeting participants discussed the
appropriateness of this approach for studies among children and youth.

**General Issues**

Before beginning telephone interviewing, researchers should investigate
telephone coverage among the proposed study population because low-income
families may not have telephones. Researchers might also consider newer
alternatives such as Internet administration, but Internet coverage among low-
income families is likely to be even lower than for telephones.

**Telephone vs. In-Person**

Studies show that responses vary according to mode of administration
(telephone vs. in-person and, for in-person interviews, whether the interview
is conducted by a doctor/nurse or other type of interviewer). People tend to
report fewer impairments when they are interviewed in-person than when they
are interviewed by telephone. Therefore, researchers might need to compare
responses from in-person and phone interviews in a sample of participants to
evaluate reliability.

**Interviewing Children by Telephone**

Studies suggest that interviewing by telephone may not be appropriate for
children and youth younger than age 13. TBI-related deficits and problems such
as fatigue and limited attention span may make phone interviews with young

Meeting participants suggested that questionnaires for use with children should be pilot tested to determine the appropriate interview length.

Families of children with TBI may be very invested in outcomes and often like to have someone to talk with. Some meeting participants reported surprise at the willingness of parents to be interviewed for longer than 60 minutes.

Effective Follow-up Interviews

Longitudinal studies of TBI outcomes involve an initial interview sometime
after TBI, then tracking participants and re-interviewing them periodically,
often at one-year intervals. Of particular concern is the potential for loss
to follow-up because the families move or no longer agree to be part of the
study. Meeting participants offered these suggestions for follow-up with
children who have TBI:

This approach could help decrease loss to follow-up because the family is less likely to have moved from the address found in the medical record. This approach would also provide useful information about patterns of early recovery.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Follow-up beginning at one year is not timely enough to meet the needs of people with TBI to be identified early and linked to information that can help them get the services they need. Meeting these needs requires a case management approach, even if it is cost- and resource-intensive. The principal investigator for the South Carolina follow-up study of older adolescents and adults estimates that double the funding it currently receives from CDC would be required to initiate active surveillance of TBI. To decrease the cost and improve the feasibility of conducting more active surveillance, researchers should consider limiting surveillance to the few hospitals that see the majority of child TBI cases--for example, Level I trauma centers and children's hospitals.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Consider alternative approaches to tracking, especially for very young children, such as early intervention tracking systems that follow very young children (younger than age 3) who have TBI or other disability (e.g., in Rhode Island).

**Length of Follow-Up**

A single year of follow-up is insufficient to document important outcomes.
Ideally, a study should follow children as long as possible through as many
developmental transitions as possible to try identifying late-emerging
problems resulting from TBI. Based on experience with the currently funded CDC
studies of outcomes in older adolescents and adults, three- to five-year
follow-up is feasible considering estimated cost and loss to follow-up.

**Tracking**

To reduce loss to follow-up, researchers should test a mechanism for routinely
contacting participant families, such as sending a postcard at frequent
intervals to track changes of address.

Advantages of and Selected Methods for Comparison Groups

Meeting participants strongly recommended including a comparison group as part
of any follow-up study of outcomes of TBI in children to strengthen the study
design and improve the usefulness of the findings. A comparison group
completes the same questionnaire as the follow-up study participants, and
researchers compare their responses with those of the children with TBI. The
comparison group need not be the same size as the group of children with TBI.
Methods of selecting a comparison group vary. Meeting participants discussed
the pros and cons of each method, as summarized below:

**Non-TBI Trauma Comparison Group**

This approach entails selecting a population of children who were injured but
did not have a TBI, matched by age and sex with the TBI children. The approach
helps control for risk factors for injury that are similar between the two
groups. The comparison group should be matched by socio-economic status to the
TBI group.

If the concern is adjusting for pre-injury risk factors only, selecting children who have recovered from the trauma may be more appropriate.

**Friend Comparison Group**

This approach involves selecting one similar-aged friend for each child with a
TBI. The "friend control" completes the questionnaire. The approach helps
control for social environment and school context, but friend controls might
not have the same pre-injury risk factors.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Defining "friend" may be difficult for very young children. Also, many children lose their friends after the TBI, so identifying a friend control may be difficult.

**Sibling Comparison Group**

This approach involves selecting a brother or sister of the child with TBI to
serve in the comparison group. The approach helps control for family
environment factors, but matching on age and sex may be impossible or there

This approach involves selecting a sample of children from the general
population, matched by age and sex. The approach allows comparison of the
normal developmental trajectory with the trajectory for children with TBI.

Meeting participants recommended this approach. They also suggested that the
optimal study would include both an age- and sex-matched comparison group and
a non-TBI trauma comparison group.

##  Other TBI Issues  

Research on outcomes of TBI is only one component of a broader effort to
improve the lives of children with TBI. Meeting participants also noted the
need for improved education and awareness of TBI as a public health problem
and the need for more CDC research. To address those needs, participants
offered the following suggestions:

### Education and Awareness

In the TBI Act Reauthorization of 2000, CDC has been given expanded
authorization for an education and awareness campaign. The campaign should
consider:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Educational efforts should be sensitive to the different information needs of parents of children whose disability resulted from a sudden change (i.e., TBI) and of parents of children with developmental disability. An education campaign should try to ensure that the information about possible outcomes of TBI in children does not result in negative self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, children with mild-to-moderate TBI may have cognitive deficits, but they are still capable of learning.

**Dissemination**

CDC should distribute educational materials as widely as possible, including
through the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau Clearinghouse, which
distributes a wide range of materials on children's health.

**CDC Research Efforts**

Meeting participants offered the following additional suggestions for steps
the CDC should take to improve knowledge about TBI outcomes in children.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Continue to collect data while ensuring more widespread dissemination. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * CDC should continue to increase awareness of the TBI problem by collecting and sharing data about the incidence and prevalence of TBI and TBI-related disability. Information should be in a form that can be distributed by health professionals to people with TBI and their families. For example, CDC should publish more brochures like the concussion brochure (Facts about Concussion and Brain Injury, Accessed January 24, 2001).

### HRSA/MCHB Principles for Meeting the Needs of the Child

**Bright Futures Children 's Health Charter**

Throughout this century, principles developed by advocates for children have
been the foundation for initiatives to improve children's lives. Bright
Futures participants have adopted these principles to guide their work and
meet the unique needs of children and families into the 21st century.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Every child deserves to be born well, to be physically fit and to achieve self-responsibility for good health habits.

### I. Basic Surveillance: Defining the Magnitude of the Problem, Identifying
Causes and High Risk Groups

In 1995, CDC funded TBI surveillance efforts in 4 states and developed
Guidelines for Surveillance of Central Nervous System Injury.3 These
surveillance efforts expanded with the implementation of Public Law 104-166,
the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996. Under the TBI Act, the CDC has
developed a uniform reporting system to answer questions about the incidence
and causes of TBI deaths and hospitalizations. The surveillance program
currently supports data collection in the following 15 states:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Alaska

### II. Outcomes Surveillance: The Colorado and South Carolina Traumatic Brain
Injury Follow-up Systems

In 1995, CDC funded a follow-up study in Colorado to describe TBI-related
disability, use of services, and other outcomes. A similar project was begun
in South Carolina in 1998 including people with TBI aged 15 years or older.
These projects:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. Each year, select a representative sample of people identified by surveillance who have been hospitalized and survived with a TBI.

### III. Future Directions: Adding Children and Adolescents to the TBI
Outcomes Surveillance Projects

Obtaining population-based TBI outcomes data for children and youth is a high
priority for the Advisory Committee of the National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control, the Brain Injury Association and a wide range of
experts and professionals who participated in the CDC-sponsored TBI in Public
Health Meeting in April 1999. The TBI Act Reauthorization of 2000 also
highlights it as a priority activity.
