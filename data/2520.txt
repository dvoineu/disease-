# Examples of Human Infections with Avian Influenza A Viruses with Possible
Limited, Non-Sustained Human-to-Human Transmission

EspaÃ±ol

Related Pages

Human infections with avian influenza A viruses are rare and have most often
occurred after people had exposure to infected poultry (e.g. direct contact
with chickens, or visiting a live poultry market). However, some clusters in
which limited, non-sustained person-to-person spread of avian influenza A
viruses was suspected or is believed to have occurred have been reported in
several countries. There is no test to confirm human-to-human spread of avian
influenza A viruses. Rather, a determination that human-to-human transmission
likely occurred is based upon the findings of detailed epidemiologic and
laboratory investigations.

For example:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * In 1997, when the first human cases of Asian H5N1 virus infection were identified in Hong Kong, there was serologic evidence of limited, non-sustained transmission of Asian H5N1 virus to a very small number of health care workers and household contacts, but the virus did not spread further.

All three family members had conjunctivitis and one also had influenza-like illness. (M Du Ry van Beest Holle, Meijer, et al, 2005.

Transmission was associated with prolonged very close unprotected contact between an ill child with H5N1 virus infection and her mother and her aunt. Further transmission did not occur.

Annual epidemics of human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses in China driven mostly by exposure to infected poultry at live poultry markets have been reported since 2013. A small percentage of reported cases have been associated with possible limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission, mostly occurring between family members. However, limited, non-sustained transmission of Asian H7N9 has been reported in a few cases in hospitals. (Xiang, N et al, 2016."Assessing Change in Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Infections During the Fourth Epidemic -- China, September 2015-August 2016"; Chen et al. 2016. "Nosocomial Co-Transmission of Avian Influenza A(H7N9) and A(H1N1)pdm09 Viruses between 2 Patients with Hematologic DisordersExternal;" Fang et al, 2015. "Nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China: epidemiological investigationExternal."

It is possible for human-to-human transmission of other non-human (animal-
origin) influenza A viruses to range along a continuum; from occasional,
limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of one or more generations
without further spread ("dead-end transmission"), to efficient and sustained
human-to-human transmission. Efficient and sustained (ongoing) transmission of
non-human influenza A viruses (including avian influenza A viruses) among
people in the community is needed for an influenza pandemic to begin.
