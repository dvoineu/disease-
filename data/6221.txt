Macroglossia is a disorder in which the tongue is larger than normal.

## Information

Macroglossia is most often caused by an increase in the amount of tissue on
the tongue, rather than by a growth, such as a tumor.

This condition can be seen in certain inherited or congenital (existing at
birth) disorders, including:

      * Acromegaly (buildup of too much growth hormone in the body)
      * Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (growth disorder that causes large body size, large organs, and other symptoms)
      * Congenital hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hormone)
      * Diabetes (high blood sugar caused by body producing too little or no insulin)
      * Down syndrome (extra copy of chromosome 21, which causes problems with physical and intellectual functioning)
      * Lymphangioma or hemangioma (malformations in the lymph system or buildup of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs)
      * Mucopolysaccharidoses (a group of diseases that cause large amounts of sugar to build up in the body's cells and tissues)
      * Primary amyloidosis (a buildup of abnormal proteins in the body's tissues and organs)
