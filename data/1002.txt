Technology-based Partner Services

The Toolkit for technology-based STD and HIV Partner Services (IPS) serves as
a general resource for health departments, community-based organizations
(CBOs) and others authorized to provide HIV/STD partner services (PS). It is
designed for use with the Internet and other digital technologies, such as
mobile phones, computers, and social networking sites, to trace and contact
persons potentially exposed to HIV and other STDs.  This toolkit updates IPS
information found in the 2008 National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSD)
Guidelines for Internet-based Partner Services1 and is a supplement to the
2008 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Recommendations for
Partner Services Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and
Chlamydial Infection.2

As trends in communication and technology have advanced, the use of current
and emerging technologies to reach at-risk individuals has become essential.
Individuals for whom there are only virtual identifiers, such as an email
address or user name, are unreachable without online search engines, email,
access to online communities, and other electronic tools.

This toolkit provides information, suggestions, and resources about the
various components of an IPS program. It should be useful in planning,
developing, implementing, and evaluating a jurisdiction-specific IPS program.
It is not intended to be used as a list of "required activities" for Disease
Intervention Specialists (DIS)*. The information presented in the toolkit is
based on published and unpublished evaluations, program experience, expert
opinion, and input from several state health departments and community-based
nonprofit organizations.

*For the purposes of this document, we use the term DIS to include any staff who interview patients and elicit partner information and perform partner notification.  Other terms for DIS may include Public Health Investigators, Disease Prevention Specialists, Public health Advisors, etc.
