Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) include parasitic, bacterial, and viral
diseases that cause illness and disability in more than 1 billion people
worldwide. This group of diseases includes onchocerciasis (river blindness),
Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF, or elephantiasis, a leading
cause of avoidable disability), and trachoma (the leading infectious cause of
blindness), as well as more than a dozen other diseases.

As the world recognizes the first annual World NTD Day, we want to share what
we are doing towards meeting the ambitious goals that will be set forth in the
World Health Organizationexternal icon (WHO)'s NTD 2030 Roadmap and beat NTDs.
For good.

Collectively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United
States Agency for International Developmentexternal icon (USAID), and our
partners have made tremendous progress towards global NTD goals. Thanks in
large part to an approach that involves periodic distribution of safe and
effective antibiotics (mass drug administration, or MDA) and other low-cost
interventions such as water filters and bed nets, many countries are
approaching nationwide elimination. Recent accomplishments include:

But the job is not done.

New tech for NTD goals

Being able to accurately determine where NTDs are still present--and detect
them should they come back--is critical to achieving and sustaining control
and elimination. Without accurate and reliable diagnostics, countries are
hobbled in their fight against these diseases.

**_Lymphatic filariasis_**

In 2018, when a CDC lab scientist uncovered a design flaw in an LF test that
resulted in some infected people having negative tests, the manufacturer moved
quickly to fix the problem and get the improved test back into the field. This
further bolstered the collective drive to pioneer better diagnostics. With
better, faster tests, in-country experts will be emboldened in their NTD
elimination efforts.

As countries move to eliminate LF and other NTDs, new tools--and the capacity
to effectively use them--are needed to help make the best decisions about what
interventions are needed and to monitor diseases after elimination so that any
reappearance can be dealt with swiftly.

**_Onchocerciasis_**

CDC is currently working with partners to validate new testing methods for
onchocerciasis. With these new methods, CDC and its partners will pinpoint
remaining areas where onchocerciasis is still active and then take
appropriate, strategic steps to interrupt transmission.

elimination of blinding trachoma, an NTD that affects approximately 84 million
people worldwide and can lead to blindness when people are repeatedly
infected. Credit: S. Elder / CDC

**_Multiplex immunoassay_**

CDC's recently developed multiplex immunoassay can detect antibodies to more
than 30 different viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease agents from just a
single small blood sample. This allows CDC to obtain critical public health
information for a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. With these
data, we are developing new strategies for identifying disease hotspots and
targeting public health interventions to affected communities.

**_Trachoma_**

Programmatic decisions about where to focus trachoma elimination efforts are
currently based on clinical eye exams. As countries reach elimination targets,
simple, low-cost tools are needed to make sure trachoma does not return.
Laboratory scientists at CDC have developed a low-cost rapid test that can
detect antibodies to trachoma in blood. This test will help CDC and its
partners monitor the impact of trachoma elimination programs and provide early
warnings about where new transmission is happening. When we know where
trachoma is spreading, we and our partners can step in and stop it.



Building international capacity to combat NTDs

be used to test blood samples for multiple parasitic diseases. CDC works with

programs. Credit: K. Won / CDC

If you've ever found yourself nervously trying to wield a confusing and
expensive power tool, you may already know that advanced tools are useless
when left in untrained hands. They're wasted.

To ensure that countries are equipped to combat NTDs, an important component
of CDC's NTD program is the development of a skilled international workforce
capable of integrating new technologies into their nations' NTD elimination
efforts and training others. CDC experts have traveled across the globe to
boost this capacity.

These efforts empower countries to wage effective NTD elimination campaigns.













NTD elimination requires collaboration

Alongside its partners--including the WHO, USAID, other US government
agencies, NGOs, health departments, and clinics--CDC is forging ahead with the
development of new tools that make NTD elimination a realistic goal. A
reachable goal. With better tools comes the promise of better health for the
millions of people worldwide still living under the threat of NTDs. For good.
