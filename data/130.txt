## Summary

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are passed from one
person to another through sexual contact. The causes of STDs are bacteria,
parasites, and viruses. There are more than 20 types of STDs, including

  * Chlamydia
  * Genital herpes
  * Gonorrhea
  * HIV/AIDS
  * HPV
  * Syphilis
  * Trichomoniasis

Most STDs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems
they cause can be more severe for women. If a pregnant woman has an STD, it
can cause serious health problems for the baby.

Antibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure
for STDs caused by a virus, but medicines can often help with the symptoms and
keep the disease under control.

Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely
eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs. The most reliable way to
avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.
