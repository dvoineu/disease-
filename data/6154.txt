**Uganda: The Hunt for Marburg Virus**  
CDC scientists have spearheaded a small pilot project deep inside the forests
of Uganda to track the movement of bats that carry the deadly Marburg virus, a
close cousin to Ebola. Scientists collect bats in Python Cave and attach GPS
units on the backs of these bats to capture their movements to better
understand how the Marburg virus is spread to people.
