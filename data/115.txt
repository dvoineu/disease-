## Summary

Every day, you have different experiences and you learn new things. Your brain
cannot store all of that information, so it has to decide what is worth
remembering. Memory is the process of storing and then remembering this
information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory stores
information for a few seconds or minutes. Long-term memory stores it for a
longer period of time.

Memory doesn't always work perfectly. As you grow older, it may take longer to
remember things.

It's normal to forget things once in a while. We've all forgotten a name,
where we put our keys, or if we locked the front door. If you are an older
adult who forget things more often than others your age, you may have mild
cognitive impairment. Forgetting how to use your phone or find your way home
may be signs of a more serious problem, such as

  * Alzheimer's disease
  * Other types of dementia
  * Stroke
  * Depression
  * Head injuries
  * Blood clots or tumors in the brain
  * Kidney, liver, or thyroid problems
  * Reactions to certain medicines

If you're worried about your forgetfulness, see your health care provider.
