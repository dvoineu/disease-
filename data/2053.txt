## Summary

Heartburn is a painful burning feeling in your chest or throat. It happens
when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus, the tube that carries food
from your mouth to your stomach.

If you have heartburn more than twice a week, you may have GERD. But you can
have GERD without having heartburn.

Pregnancy, certain foods, alcohol, and some medications can bring on
heartburn. Treating heartburn is important because over time reflux can damage
the esophagus.

Over-the-counter medicines may help. If the heartburn continues, you may need
prescription medicines or surgery.

If you have other symptoms such as crushing chest pain, it could be a heart
attack. Get help immediately.
