findings show that people from 12 to 20 years of age consume about one-tenth
of all alcohol consumed in the United States.

### Risks of Substance Use

The guide also highlights the risks of substance use among teens. Substance
use can do the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Affect the growth and development of teens, especially brain development.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Occur more frequently with other risky behaviors, such as unprotected sex and dangerous driving.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Contribute to the development of adult health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders.

Finally, the earlier teens start using substances, the greater their chances
of continuing to use substances and developing substance use problems later in
life. When teens begin drinking at an early age, they increase the chance of
becoming addicted to or continuing to abuse substances later in life.

### Guide for Pediatricians

Pediatricians can help teens avoid and reduce substance use by talking with
them about their use. The guide,  _Substance Use Screening and Intervention
Implementation Guide: No Amount of Substance Use Is Safe for Adolescents_
Cdc-pdfpdf icon[3 MB]Externalexternal icon, provides helpful information for
pediatricians to implement substance use screening and brief counseling in
their practices. In addition, it provides guidance on protecting patient
privacy and other key issues.

### CDC Activities

CDC has conducted fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) research,
identification, and prevention efforts since 1991. Key activities include
