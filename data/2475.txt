This guidance pertains to avian influenza A(H7N9), Asian H5N1, and the newly
detected avian influenza H5 viruses in the United States (H5N2, H5N8, and the
new reassortant H5N1 virus).

### Background

This document provides interim guidance for clinicians and public health
professionals in the United States on follow-up and influenza antiviral
chemoprophylaxis of persons exposed to birds infected with avian influenza A
viruses associated either with severe human disease or thought to have the
potential to cause severe human disease. Examples of viruses associated with
severe human disease include Asian avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)
viruses. Examples of viruses with the potential to cause severe human disease
include avian influenza A(H5N2) and (H5N8) viruses, and a new reassortant
avian influenza A(H5N1) virus1, all of which were detected in wild and
domestic birds in North America in December 2014 and January 2015. There is
limited experience with these newly detected viruses to inform public health
guidance. However, these viruses are thought to have the potential to infect
people and cause severe illness. To date no human avian influenza infections
have been documented in the U.S. CDC will update this guidance as additional
information becomes available.

### Exposure to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza

An exposed person is defined as a person with contact2 in the past 10 days3 to
infected **sick or dead birds** , or infected flocks. Infected refers to
infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease
or which have the potential to cause severe human disease.

### Monitoring of Exposed Persons

Exposed persons should monitor themselves for new illness for 10 days after
the last known exposure. The presence of fever and respiratory symptoms (e.g.,
cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing) should be
assessed daily during this period.

Any exposed person who has a new fever or respiratory symptoms should be
referred for prompt medical evaluation, antiviral treatment, and testing for
avian influenza (A) virus infection.

### Post-exposure Chemoprophylaxis of Exposed Persons

Chemoprophylaxis with influenza antiviral medications **can be considered**
for all exposed persons. Decisions to initiate antiviral chemoprophylaxis
should be based on clinical judgment, with consideration given to the type of
exposure and to whether the exposed person is at high risk for complications
from influenza.

If antiviral chemoprophylaxis is initiated, **treatment dosing** for the
neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir (one dose twice daily) is
recommended in these instances instead of the typical antiviral
chemoprophylaxis regimen (once daily).4 For specific dosage recommendations
for treatment by age group, please see Influenza Antiviral Medications:
Summary for Clinicians. Physicians should consult the manufacturer's package
insert for dosing, limitations of populations studied, contraindications, and
adverse effects. If exposure was time-limited and not ongoing, five days of
medication (one dose twice daily), from the last known exposure is
recommended.

Chemoprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for personnel involved in
culling non-infected or likely non-infected bird populations as a control
measure or personnel involved in handling sick birds or decontaminating
affected environments (including animal disposal) who used proper personal
protective equipment.

See CDC guidance for follow-up and antiviral chemoprophylaxis of contacts of
cases of human infection with avian influenza A viruses associated with severe
human disease.

### Footnotes

1 The H5N1 virus isolated from a US wild bird is a new mixed-origin virus (a
"reassortant") that is genetically different from the avian H5N1 viruses that
have caused human infections with high mortality in several other countries
(notably in Asia and Africa). No human infections with this new reassortant
H5N1 virus have been reported.

2 This direct exposure may include: contact with birds (e.g., handling,
slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, preparation for consumption); direct
contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or bird parts (carcasses,
internal organs, etc.); or prolonged exposure to birds in a confined space.

3 The potential incubation period is unknown for avian influenza A viruses
which are not yet known to cause human disease. Available data suggest that
the estimated incubation period for human infection with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses
is generally 3 to 7 days, but has been reported to be as long as 10 days.

4 This recommendation for twice daily antiviral chemoprophylaxis dosing
frequency is based on limited data that support higher chemoprophylaxis dosing
in animals for avian A(H5N1) virus (Boltz DA, et al JID 2008;197:1315) and the
desire to reduce the potential for development of resistance while receiving
once daily dosing ( BazM, et al NEJM 2009;361:2296; Cane A et al PIDJ
2010;29:384; MMWR 2009;58:969).
