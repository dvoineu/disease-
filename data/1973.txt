## Summary

The anus is the opening of the rectum through which stool passes out of your
body. Problems with the anus are common. They include hemorrhoids, abscesses,
fissures (cracks), and cancer.

You may be embarrassed to talk about your anal troubles. But it is important
to let your doctor know, especially if you have pain or bleeding. The more
details you can give about your problem, the better your doctor will be able
to help you. Treatments vary depending on the particular problem.
