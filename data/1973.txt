The YTS Startup Package was developed in response to the continuous technical
assistance being requested by states implementing the Youth Tobacco Survey
(YTS). The documents are typically sent to states via email in a "zip" file.
States receive the master file soon after they've contacted the Office on
Smoking and Health (OSH) expressing an interest in conducting a YTS.
