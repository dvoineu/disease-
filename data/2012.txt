## Summary

Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally.
Vitamin C is an antioxidant. It is important for your skin, bones, and
connective tissue. It promotes healing and helps the body absorb iron.

Vitamin C comes from fruits and vegetables. Good sources include citrus, red
and green peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and greens. Some juices and cereals
have added vitamin C.

Some people may need extra vitamin C:

    * Pregnant/breastfeeding women
    * Smokers
    * People recovering from surgery
    * Burn victims
