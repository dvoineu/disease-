## Summary

Each step you take involves a complex network of bones, muscles, tendons, and
ligaments. This, combined with all of the weight they carry, explains why feet
can have problems. To keep your feet healthy

    * Examine your feet regularly
    * Wear comfortable shoes that fit
    * Wash your feet daily with soap and lukewarm water 
    * Trim your toenails straight across and not too short

Your foot health can be a clue to your overall health. For example, joint
stiffness could mean arthritis. Tingling or numbness could be a sign of
diabetes. Swelling might indicate kidney disease, heart disease, or high blood
pressure.

Good foot care and regular foot checks are an important part of your health
care. If you have foot problems, be sure to talk to your doctor.
