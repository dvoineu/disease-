Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus
(KFDV), a member of the virus family _Flaviviridae_. KFDV was identified in
1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in
Karnataka (formerly Mysore) State, India. Since then, between 400-500 humans
cases per year have been reported.

Hard ticks ( _Hemaphysalis spinigera_ ) are the reservoir of KFD virus and
once infected, remain so for life. Rodents, shrews, and monkeys are common
hosts for KFDV after being bitten by an infected tick. KFDV can cause
epizootics with high fatality in primates.

Transmission

Transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected
animal...

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms of KFD may appear suddenly 3-8 days after exposure...

Risk of Exposure

KFD has historically been limited to the western and central districts of
Karnataka State, India...

Diagnosis

Diagnosis can be made in the early stage of illness by molecular detection by
PCR...

Treatment

Hospitalization and supportive therapy is important for treating KFD...

Prevention

A vaccine does exist for KFD and is used in endemic areas of India...
