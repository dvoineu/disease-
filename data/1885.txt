## Summary

As a teenager, you go through many physical, mental, emotional, and social
changes. The biggest change is puberty, the process of becoming sexually
mature. It usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16
for boys. As your body changes, you may have questions about sexual health.

During this time, you start to develop your own unique personality and
opinions. Some changes that you might notice include

    * Increased independence from your parents
    * More concerns about body image and clothes
    * More influence from peers
    * Greater ability to sense right and wrong

All of these changes can sometimes seem overwhelming. Some sadness or
moodiness can be normal. But feeling very sad, hopeless, or worthless could be
warning signs of a mental health problem. If you need help, talk to your
parents, school counselor, or health care provider.
