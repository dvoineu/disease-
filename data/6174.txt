# Short philtrum

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

A short philtrum is a shorter than normal distance between the upper lip and
the nose.

## Considerations

The philtrum is the groove that runs from the top of the lip to the nose.

The length of the philtrum is passed down from parents to their children
through genes. This groove is shortened in people with certain conditions.

## Causes

This condition can be caused by:

      * Chromosome 18q deletion syndrome
      * Cohen syndrome
      * DiGeorge syndrome
      * Oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFD) 

## Home Care

No home care needed for a short philtrum, in most cases. However, if this is
only one symptom of another disorder, follow your health care provider's
instructions on how to care for the condition.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you notice a short philtrum on your child.

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

An infant with a short philtrum may have other symptoms and signs. Taken
together, these may define a specific syndrome or condition. The provider will
diagnose that condition based on a family history, medical history, and
physical exam.

Medical history questions may include:

      * Did you notice this when the child was born?
      * Have any other family members had this feature?
      * Have any other family members been diagnosed with a disorder associated with a short philtrum?
      * What other symptoms are present? 

Tests to diagnose a short philtrum:

      * Chromosome studies
      * Enzyme tests
      * Metabolic studies on both mother and infant
      * X-rays 

If your provider diagnosed a short philtrum, you may want to note that
diagnosis in your personal medical record.
