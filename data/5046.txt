Quality control (QC) of media

Each batch of media prepared in the laboratory and each new manufacturer's lot
number of media should be tested using appropriate QC reference strains for
sterility, the ability to support growth of the target organism(s), and/or the
ability to produce proper biochemical reactions. A QC record should be
maintained for all media prepared in the laboratory and purchased
commercially; including preparation or purchase date and QC test results. Any
unusual characteristic of the medium, such as color or texture, or slow growth
of reference strains should be noted.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. Routine agar and broth mediaAll agar media should be aseptically prepared and dispensed into 15×100 mm Petri dishes (15-20 ml per dish). After pouring, the plates should be kept at room temperature (25°C) for several hours to prevent excess condensation from forming on the covers of the dishes. For optimal growth, the plates should be placed in a sterile plastic bag and stored in an inverted position at 4°C until use. All broth media should be stored in an appropriate container at 4°C until use. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. **Blood agar plate (BAP): trypticase soy agar (TSA) + 5% sheep blood** A BAP is used as a general blood agar medium. It is used for growth and testing of _N. meningitidis_ and _S. pneumoniae._ The plate should appear a bright red color. If the plates appear dark red, they are either old or the blood was likely added when the agar was too hot. If so, the media should be discarded and a new batch should be prepared.

Chocolate agar plate (CAP)CAP is a medium that supports the special growth requirements (hemin and NAD) needed for the isolation of fastidious organisms, such as _H. influenzae_ , when incubated at 35-37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. CAP has a reduced concentration of agar, which increases the moisture content of the medium. It can be prepared with heat-lysed horse blood, which is a good source of both hemin and NAD, although sheep blood can also be used. Growth occurs on a CAP because NAD is released from the blood during the heating process of chocolate agar preparation (the heating process also inactivates growth inhibitors) and hemin is available from non-hemolyzed as well as hemolyzed blood cells.

Mueller-Hinton agarMueller-Hinton agar (MHA) is used for making the media required for susceptibility testing for _N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae,_ and _H. influenzae_. It is recommended that dehydrated Mueller-Hinton agar medium be purchased commercially because preparing it with individual ingredients can diminish the quality.

Modified Trans-Isolate (MT-I) mediumModified Trans-Isolate medium (MT-I) was designed and developed to be a simple and inexpensive medium for transport of CSF and growth of meningococci in large scale epidemics of meningococcal disease. It is less expensive and easier to produce than the standard T-I, and can be produced in most microbiology laboratories at approximately USD $0.50/bottle, providing a relatively inexpensive, rapidly available (reducing the production and shipping time and cost) transport medium and diagnostic tool for use during a meningitis epidemic. The ingredients of the MT-I formulation are similar to those in T-I, with modifications to eliminate costly ingredients and save time. 

Laboratory evaluation has demonstrated that growth/survival of isolates of
meningococci was equal in T-I and MT-I under several environmental conditions.
It has not been evaluated under field conditions with clinical specimens yet.
It does not support the growth of _H. influenzae_ ; therefore, it is not used
for routine surveillance of agents of bacterial meningitis.

0.5 oz, sterile round, clear glass screw-cap (with rubber liner) bottles
should be used.  
MT-I bottles should be stored upright at 4°C when not in immediate use and
warmed to room temperature (25-30°C) before use. In the refrigerator, the
liquid phase becomes gelatinous but re-liquefies at room temperature. MT-I
media has a shelf life of 1 year with proper storage.

Trans-Isolate (T-I) mediumT-I is used to transport CSF and grow _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae,_ and _S. pneumoniae_ from CSF. 10 cc tubing vials with rubber septum plugs and aluminum crimp seal caps should be used. T-I bottles should be stored upright at 4°C when not in immediate use. T-I media should be warmed to room temperature (25°C) before use. In the refrigerator, the liquid phase becomes gelatinous but re-liquefies at room temperature. T-I media has a shelf life of 1 year with proper storage.

Store the McFarland standard at room temperature (25°C) when not in use. Prepare a fresh standard solution every 6 months. McFarland standard density solution will precipitate and clump over time, and it needs vigorous vortexing before each use. Mark the tube to indicate the level of liquid, and check before use to be sure that evaporation has not occurred.
