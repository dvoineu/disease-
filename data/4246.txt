# Division of Select Agents and Toxins: CDC 90-Day Internal Review

Minus

Related Pages

The nation relies on research to improve the rapid detection of biological
threats and to develop the medical countermeasures to prevent and treat them.
The Federal Select Agent Program oversees the possession, use, and transfer of
biological select agents and toxins which have the potential to pose a severe
threat to human, animal, or plant health or to animal or plant products. The
Federal Select Agent Program consists of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) and the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection ServiceExternal (APHIS) Agriculture Select Agent
ServicesExternal (AgSAS). CDC provides oversight for the select agents and
toxins that cause diseases in people, and USDA provides oversight for select
agents and toxins that cause diseases in animals and plants (CDC and USDA
share the responsibility for agents that threaten both humans and animals,
such as anthrax).

In summer 2015, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden ordered an internal 90-day review
of CDC's select agent and toxin regulatory program overseen by DSAT. A CDC
Internal Review Workgroup was established to examine the Federal Select Agent
Program and make recommendations to improve CDC's responsibilities within
FSAP. The Workgroup has not yet involved AgSAS to reconcile recommendations
that have impact on both programs.

The Workgroup noted ongoing reviews of biosafety and biosecurity conducted by
the U.S. Government since the time Executive Order 13546 was published in
2010Cdc-pdfExternal. They made observations leading to actionable
recommendations in three broad categories (inspections, incident reporting,
and transparency) to improve the CDC select agent and toxin regulatory
program. The recommendations, referred to as the CDC 90-Day Internal Review of
the Division of Select Agents and Toxins, are detailed below:

Inspections

**_Observation A:_** Some regulated entities have reported variability in the
skills and approach of inspectors.

**_Recommendation 1_** : Reduce potential variability of inspections.  DSAT
shall identify activities in inspection checklists that can be completed in
quantitative as distinguished from a qualitative manner. Activities requiring
qualitative analysis shall be the focus of added specificity and enhanced
training and coordination among inspection teams to reduce potential
variation.

**_Observation B_** : About 20-30% of final inspection reports are not issued
within the DSAT 30-day target (interval between the inspection and the final
report), delaying timely resolution of findings.

**_Recommendation 2_** : Increase timeliness of inspection reports.  DSAT
shall initiate routine analyses of inspection report timeliness data to
identify modifiable characteristics of DSAT reports delayed beyond 30 days.
DSAT shall report timeliness metrics and performance goals to the regulated
community annually.

DSAT shall work with AgSAS to implement a policy for providing interim reports
to entities when final reports are likely to be delayed.

DSAT shall present staffing and retention plans to support the program's
inspection goals, as well as recommendations from this and related federal
reports.

**_Observation C_** : Select agent laboratories do not currently implement a
standardized risk assessment process to identify the highest risk activities.

**_Recommendation 3_** :  Review and implement options for standardized risk
assessment.  CDC, in collaboration with APHIS, shall convene an independent
scientific body to review the science and practice of risk assessment in the
modern select agent laboratory and provide recommendations that improve the
effectiveness and timeliness of the inspection process.

**_Observation D_** : Clear descriptions of progressive categories of the
severity of inspection findings will enable the Federal Select Agent Program
to refine penalties and corrective actions to the appropriate level of risk
and to convey the appropriate level of concern when reporting findings.

**_Recommendation 4_** : Design and implement a pilot program to better
characterize the severity of inspection findings.  In collaboration with
APHIS, DSAT shall develop and implement a pilot program to characterize and
score inspection findings according to severity level. A 12-month pilot
program shall be implemented to include sharing scores with entities and
gather feedback to improve the process.

**_Observation E_** : Enforcement options for DSAT are limited and difficult
to scale to the range of safety and security findings on inspections.  Most
compliance issues and violations are resolved through negotiated corrective
action plans.

**_Recommendation 5_** : Prioritize and strengthen enforcement actions to the
highest risk violations.  DSAT shall produce a list of violations and findings
identified for corrective action since the initiation of the DSAT Corrective
Action Plan program. DSAT shall order the list according to the level of
oversight concern (i.e., severity). The list shall then be reviewed by a DSAT-
convened panel of experts for feedback on the completeness of the list, the
DSAT assessment of severity, and the enforcement action taken.

**_Recommendation 6_** : DSAT shall produce a report on other approaches to
increasing compliance with regulations (e.g., consultative services and
incentives) based on review of other regulatory programs (e.g., nuclear
research, aviation safety).

**_Observation F_** : The Internal Review Workgroup acknowledged uncertainties
and gaps in understanding how best to strengthen biosafety and to implement
measures that appropriately balance the ability to conduct life-saving
research with biological select agents and toxins and the need to ensure the
safety and security of the public and the workers in these institutions.

**_Recommendation 7_** :  Analyze trends and associations between inspection
findings and risk.  In collaboration with AgSAS, DSAT shall draw on CDC
scientific expertise to conduct an assessment of inspection and investigation

Incident Reporting

**_Observation G_** : The terminology used in the APHIS/CDC Form 3 ( _Report
of Theft, Loss, or Release of Select Agents and Toxins_ ) does not convey the
level of risk to safety and security or the extent of concern. For example,
the term 'release' is currently being used to describe both a vial spilled
within a biosafety cabinet with multiple layers of containment and a potential
event in which _Bacillus anthracis_ spores escape the facility to the
surrounding community. Better defining the terms, including sub-categories of
'release' and 'loss' that convey a gradient in risk, would improve the
distinction between significant incidents that pose risk to laboratory staff
or the public from those incidents that pose low, if any, risk due to the
layers of protection that are in place.

**_Recommendation 8_** :  Make reporting more informative about the actual and
potential risk of reported incidents.  DSAT, with AgSAS, shall complete a
review to update the APHIS/CDC Form 3, to include subcategories of "release"
and "loss" and additional fields to more consistently categorize an incident
with regard to such matters as the type of release (e.g., potential release,
spill within secondary containment, occupational exposure, possible breach of
facility containment, etc.), type of exposure (e.g., none, intact personal
protective equipment (PPE), skin, mucosal, waste water, etc.), and the
understanding of safety and security risk levels relative to human illness.
Input shall be solicited from the regulated community and interested
stakeholders before the new form is put into practice.

**_Observation H_ :  **Molecular diagnostic methods are constantly improving
and may offer faster and more sensitive confirmation than culture. The Federal
Select Agent Program currently defines identification of a select agent as
growing the agent in culture, such that if there is a disease confirmed with
molecular diagnostic methods but not culture, the threshold for the laboratory
to report the discovery of a select agent is not met (APHIS/CDC Form 4). The
possession, use, and transfer of the associated clinical samples would not
fall under Federal Select Agent Program safety or security regulations.  

**_Recommendation 9_** : Keep pace with scientific advances including through
incorporation of molecular diagnostic methods.  The Federal Select Agent
Program shall develop a plan to update policies or initiate regulatory changes
to include molecular testing methods as an option for the confirmation of the
presence of select agents and toxins in clinical samples drawn for suspicion
of biological select agent or toxin-associated disease. The plan should
include an assessment of the impact of changing the definition of select agent
and toxin identification on Form 4 reporting.

Transparency and Public Understanding

**_Observation I_ : **Inspection reports and corrective action plans are
typically only provided to the inspected entity. The Internal Review Workgroup
expressed interest in sharing inspection data to increase public understanding
of the work of biological select agents and toxins registered entities.

**_Recommendation 10_** : Without risking the security of regulated entities
and the agents and toxins they work with, increase public reporting of
inspection processes and findings.  DSAT shall present a decision briefing for
releasing more informative aggregate information regarding inspection findings
on a routine basis (consistent with terminology enhancements in Recommendation
4) and an approach to develop concurrence on this approach with AgSAS and
federal biosecurity experts.
