What is infertility?

![a flower in
bloom](/reproductivehealth/images/infertility/infertility-431px.jpg)

In general, infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant
(conceive) after one year (or longer) of unprotected sex. Because fertility in
women is known to decline steadily with age, some providers evaluate and treat
women aged 35 years or older after 6 months of unprotected sex. Women with
infertility should consider making an appointment with a reproductive
endocrinologist--a doctor who specializes in managing infertility.
Reproductive endocrinologists may also be able to help women with recurrent
pregnancy loss, defined as having two or more spontaneous miscarriages.

Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps.

Yes. About 6% of married women aged 15 to 44 years in the United States are
unable to get pregnant after one year of trying (infertility). Also, about 12%
of women aged 15 to 44 years in the United States have difficulty getting
pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term, regardless of marital status
(impaired fecundity).  

Is infertility just a woman's problem?

No, infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both men and women can
contribute to infertility.  

Many couples struggle with infertility and seek help to become pregnant, but
it is often thought of as only a woman's condition. However, in about 35% of
couples with infertility, a male factor is identified along with a female
factor. In about 8% of couples with infertility, a male factor is the only
identifiable cause.

Almost 9% of men aged 25 to 44 years in the United States reported that they
or their partner saw a doctor for advice, testing, or treatment for
infertility during their lifetime.

What causes infertility in men?

Infertility in men can be caused by different factors and is typically
evaluated by a semen analysis. When a semen analysis is performed, the number
of sperm (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape) are
assessed by a specialist. A slightly abnormal semen analysis does not mean
that a man is necessarily infertile. Instead, a semen analysis helps determine
if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.

What causes infertility in women?

Women need functioning ovariesexternal icon, fallopian tubesexternal icon, and
a uterusexternal icon to get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these
organs can contribute to female infertility. Some of these conditions are
listed below and can be evaluated using a number of different tests.

**Disruption of ovarian function (presence or absence of ovulation
(anovulation) and effects of ovarian "age")**

A woman's menstrual cycleexternal icon is, on average, 28 days long. Day 1 is
defined as the first day of "full flow." Regular predictable periods that
occur every 24 to 32 days likely reflect ovulation. A woman with irregular
periods is likely not ovulating.

Ovulation can be predicted by using an ovulation predictor kit and can be
confirmed by a blood test to check the woman's progesterone level on day 21 of
her menstrual cycle. Although several tests exist to evaluate a woman's
ovarian function, no single test is a perfect predictor of fertility. The most
commonly used markers of ovarian function include follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) value on day 3 to 5 of the menstrual cycle, anti-mullerian hormone value
(AMH), and antral follicle count (AFC) using a transvaginal ultrasound.

Disruptions in ovarian function may be caused by several conditions and
warrants an evaluation by a doctor.

When a woman doesn't ovulate during a menstrual cycle, it's called
anovulation. Potential causes of anovulation include the following

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).external icon PCOS is a condition that causes women to not ovulate, or to ovulate irregularly. Some women with PCOS have elevated levels of testosterone, which can cause acne and excess hair growth. PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility.

Women are born with all of the eggs that they will ever have, and a woman's egg count decreases over time. Diminished ovarian reserve is a condition in which there are fewer eggs remaining in the ovaries than normal. The number of eggs a woman has declines naturally as a woman ages. It may also occur due to congenital, medical, surgical, or unexplained causes. Women with diminished ovarian reserve may be able to conceive naturally, but will produce fewer eggs in response to fertility treatments.

It is sometimes associated with eating disorders such as anorexia.

The hypothalamus and pituitary glands in the brain produce hormones that maintain normal ovarian function. Production of too much of the hormone prolactin by the pituitary gland (often as the result of a benign pituitary gland tumor), or improper function of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, may cause a woman not to ovulate.

POI, sometimes referred to as premature menopause, occurs when a woman's ovaries fail before she is 40 years of age. Although certain exposures, such as chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy, and certain medical conditions may cause POI, the cause is often unexplained. About 5% to10% of women with POI conceive naturally and have a normal pregnancy.

By definition, a woman in menopause has not had a period in one year. She may experience hot flashes, mood changes, difficulty sleeping, and other symptoms as well.

**Fallopian tube obstruction (whether fallopian tubes are open, blocked, or
swollen)**

Risk factors for blocked fallopian tubesexternal icon (tubal occlusion) can
include a history of pelvic infection, history of ruptured appendicitis,
history of gonorrhea or chlamydia, known endometriosisexternal icon, or a
history of abdominal surgery.

Tubal evaluation may be performed using an X-ray that is called a
hysterosalpingogram (HSG), or by chromopertubation (CP) in the operating room
at time of laparoscopy, a surgical procedure in which a small incision is made
and a viewing tube called a laparoscope is inserted.

A radiologist injects dye into the uterus through the cervix and simultaneously takes X-ray pictures to see if the dye moves freely through fallopian tubes. This helps evaluate tubal caliber (diameter) and patency.

Blue-colored dye is passed through the cervix into the uterus and spillage and tubal caliber (shape) is evaluated.

**Abnormal uterine contour (physical characteristics of the uterus)**

Depending on a woman's symptoms, the uterusexternal icon may be evaluated by
transvaginal ultrasound to look for fibroidsexternal icon or other anatomic
abnormalities. If suspicion exists that the fibroids may be entering the
endometrial cavity, a sonohystogram (SHG) or hysteroscopy (HSC) may be
performed to further evaluate the uterine environment.

More women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 20% of women in the United States now have their first child after age 35. About one-third of couples in which the woman is older than 35 years have fertility problems. Aging not only decreases a woman's chances of having a baby, but also increases her chances of miscarriageexternal icon and of having a child with a genetic abnormality.

How long should couples try to get pregnant before seeing a doctor?

Most experts suggest at least one year for women younger than age 35. However,
for women aged 35 years or older, couples should see a health care provider
after 6 months of trying unsuccessfully. A woman's chances of having a baby
decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.

Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, couples with
the following signs or symptoms should not delay seeing their health care

What are some of the specific treatments for male infertility?

Male infertility may be treated with medical, surgical, or assisted
reproductive therapies depending on the underlying cause. Medical and surgical
therapies are usually managed by an urologist who specializes in infertility.
A reproductive endocrinologist may offer intrauterine inseminations (IUIs) or
in vitro fertilization (IVF) to help overcome male factor infertility.

What medicines are used to treat infertility in women?

Some common medicines used to treat infertility in women include

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Clomiphene citrate (Clomid®*) is a medicine that causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. It is often used in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)external icon or other problems with ovulation. It is also used in women with normal ovulation to increase the number of mature eggs produced. This medicine is taken by mouth.

Many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or
other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses may have more
problems during pregnancy. Multiple fetuses have a higher risk of being born
prematurely (too early). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and
developmental problems.

What is intrauterine insemination (IUI)?

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is often
called artificial insemination. In this procedure, specially prepared sperm
are inserted into the woman's uterus. Sometimes the woman is also treated with
medicines that stimulate ovulation before IUI.

IUI is often used to treat

What is assisted reproductive technology (ART)?

Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments in
which both eggs and embryos are handled outside of the body. In general, ART
procedures involve removing mature eggs from a woman's ovaries using a needle,
combining the eggs with sperm in the laboratory, and returning the embryos to
the woman's body or donating them to another woman. The main type of ART is in
vitro fertilization (IVF).

How often is assisted reproductive technology (ART) successful?

Success rates vary and depend on many factors, including the clinic performing
the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing
the procedure. This last factor--the woman's age--is especially important.

CDC collects success rates on ART for some fertility clinics. According to the
CDC's 2015 ART Success Rates, the average percentage of fresh, nondonor ART
cycles that led to a live birth were

Success rates also vary from clinic to clinic and with different infertility
diagnoses.

ART can be expensive and time-consuming, but it has allowed many couples to
have children that otherwise would not have been conceived. The most common
complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. This is a problem that can be
prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are transferred
back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo, rather than
multiple embryos, greatly reduces the chances of a multiple pregnancy and its
risks such as preterm birth.

Fertilization occurs in the woman's body.

ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs (eggs from another
woman), donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes
used for women who cannot produce eggs. Also, donor eggs or donor sperm are
sometimes used when the woman or man has a genetic disease that can be passed
on to the baby. An infertile woman or couple may also use donor embryos. These
are embryos that were either created by couples in infertility treatment or
were created from donor sperm and donor eggs. The donated embryo is
transferred to the uterus. The child will not be genetically related to either
parent.

Gestational Carrier

Women with ovaries but no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier.
This may also be an option for women who shouldn't become pregnant because of
a serious health problem. In this case, a woman uses her own egg. It is
fertilized by her partner's sperm and the embryo is placed inside the
carrier's uterus.
