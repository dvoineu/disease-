## Summary

Many children wet the bed until they are 5 or even older. A child's bladder
might be too small. Or the amount of urine produced overnight can be more than
the bladder can hold. Some children sleep too deeply or take longer to learn
bladder control. Stress can also be a factor. Children should not be punished
for wetting the bed. They don't do it on purpose, and most outgrow it.

Call the doctor if your child is 7 years old or older and wets the bed more
than two or three times in a week. The doctor will look for and treat any
other heath problems that could cause the bedwetting. Bedwetting alarms,
bladder training, and medicines might help with the bedwetting.
