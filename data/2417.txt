# High blood pressure - what to ask your doctor

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood
against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is
given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic
blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart
beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.

When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and
blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at
a higher risk for heart attacks and other vascular (blood vessel diseases),
strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.
