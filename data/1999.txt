## Summary

Cardiomyopathy is the name for diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases
enlarge your heart muscle or make it thicker and more rigid than normal. In
rare cases, scar tissue replaces the muscle tissue.

Some people live long, healthy lives with cardiomyopathy. Some people don't
even realize they have it. In others, however, it can make the heart less able
to pump blood through the body. This can cause serious complications,
including

    * Heart failure 
    * Abnormal heart rhythms 
    * Heart valve problems
    * Sudden cardiac arrest

Heart attacks, high blood pressure, infections, and other diseases can all
cause cardiomyopathy. Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. In many
people, however, the cause is unknown. Treatment might involve medicines,
surgery, other medical procedures, and lifestyle changes.
