The Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool (HECAT) is an assessment tool to
help school districts, schools, and others conduct a clear, complete, and
consistent analysis of health education curricula based on the **National
Health Education Standards**  and CDC's **Characteristics of an Effective
Health Education Curriculum.**

HECAT results can help school select or develop appropriate and effective
health education curricula, enhance existing curricula, and improve the
delivery of health education. The HECAT can be customized to meet local
community needs and conform to the curriculum requirements of the state or
school district.
