## Summary

Lymphedema is the name of a type of swelling. It happens when lymph builds up
in your body's soft tissues. Lymph is a fluid that contains white blood cells
that defend against germs. It can build up when the lymph system is damaged or
blocked. It usually happens in the arms or legs.

Causes of lymphedema include

    * Infection
    * Cancer
    * Scar tissue from radiation therapy or surgical removal of lymph nodes
    * Inherited conditions in which lymph nodes or vessels are absent or abnormal

Treatment can help control symptoms. It includes exercise, compression
devices, skin care, and massage.
