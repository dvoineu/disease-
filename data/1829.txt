## Summary

The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It
produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help
control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer usually begins in the cells that
produce the juices. Some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include

    * Smoking 
    * Long-term diabetes 
    * Chronic pancreatitis 
    * Certain hereditary disorders 

Pancreatic cancer is hard to catch early. It doesn't cause symptoms right
away. When you do get symptoms, they are often vague or you may not notice
them. They include yellowing of the skin and eyes, pain in the abdomen and
back, weight loss and fatigue. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind
other organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during
routine exams. Doctors use a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and a
biopsy to diagnose it.

Because it is often found late and it spreads quickly, pancreatic cancer can
be hard to treat. Possible treatments include surgery, radiation,
chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other
substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.
