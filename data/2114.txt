## Summary

When your kidneys are healthy, they clean your blood. They also make hormones
that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail,
you need treatment to replace the work your kidneys used to do. Unless you
have a kidney transplant, you will need a treatment called dialysis.

There are two main types of dialysis. Both types filter your blood to rid your
body of harmful wastes, extra salt, and water.

    * Hemodialysis uses a machine. It is sometimes called an artificial kidney. You usually go to a special clinic for treatments several times a week.
    * Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen, called the peritoneal membrane, to filter your blood.
