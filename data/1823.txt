## Summary

Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your
collarbone. It makes hormones that help the body work normally. There are
several types of cancer of the thyroid gland. You are at greater risk if you

    * Are between ages 25 and 65
    * Are a woman
    * Are Asian
    * Have a family member who has had thyroid disease
    * Have had radiation treatments to your head or neck

You should see a doctor if you have a lump or swelling in your neck. Doctors
use a physical exam, thyroid tests, other blood and imaging tests, and a
biopsy to diagnose thyroid cancer. Treatment depends on the type of cancer you
have and how far the cancer has spread. Many patients receive a combination of
treatments. They may include surgery, radioactive iodine, hormone treatment,
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses
drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to
normal cells.
