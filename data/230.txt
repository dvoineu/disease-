## Summary

An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means
that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern.
When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia. When the
heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of
arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heart
beat.

Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart
attack, smoking, congenital heart defects, and stress. Some substances or
medicines may also cause arrhythmias.

Symptoms of arrhythmias include

  * Fast or slow heart beat
  * Skipping beats
  * Lightheadedness or dizziness
  * Chest pain
  * Shortness of breath 
  * Sweating 

Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to
restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines, an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, or sometimes surgery.
