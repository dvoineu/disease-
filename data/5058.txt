# Influenza A Subtypes and the Species Affected

Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the
surface of the virus: the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N). There
are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase
subtypes. All known subtypes of influenza A viruses have been found among
birds, except subtype H17N10 and H18N11 which have only been found in bats.
Below is a table showing the different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase
subtypes and the species in which they have been detected.
