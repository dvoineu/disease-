Neurogenic bladder is a problem in which a person lacks bladder control due to
a brain, spinal cord,Â or nerve condition.

## Causes

Several muscles and nerves must work together for the bladder to hold urine
until you are ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the
brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are
damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax
at the right time.

Disorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder.
These can include:

    * Alzheimer disease
    * Birth defects of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida
    * Brain or spinal cord tumors
    * Cerebral palsy
    * Encephalitis
    * Learning disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
    * Multiple sclerosisÂ (MS)
    * Parkinson disease
    * Spinal cord injury
    * Stroke

Damage or disorders of the nerves that supply the bladder can also cause this
condition. These can include:

    * Nerve damageÂ (neuropathy)
    * Nerve damage due to long-term, heavy alcohol use
    * Nerve damage due to long-term diabetes
    * Vitamin B12 deficiency
    * Nerve damage from syphilis
    * Nerve damage due to pelvic surgery
    * Nerve damage from a herniated disk or spinal canal stenosis 

## Symptoms

The symptoms depend on the cause. They often include symptoms of urinary
incontinence.

Symptoms of overactive bladder may include:

    * Having to urinate too often in small amounts
    * Problems emptying all the urine from the bladder
    * Loss of bladder control 

Symptoms of underactive bladder may include:

    * Full bladder and possibly urine leakage
    * Inability to tell when the bladder is full
    * Problems starting to urinate or emptying all the urine from the bladder (urinary retention)

## Treatment

Medicines may help manage your symptoms. Your health care provider may
suggest:

    * Medicines that relax the bladder (oxybutynin, tolterodine, or propantheline)
    * Medicines that make certain nerves more active (bethanechol)
    * Botulinum toxin
    * GABA supplements
    * Antiepileptic drugs 

Your provider may refer you to someone who has been trained to help people
manage bladder problems.

Skills or techniques you may learn include:

    * Exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles (Kegel exercises)
    * Keeping a diary of when you urinate, the amount you urinated, and if you leaked urine. This may help you learn when you should empty your bladder and when it may be best to be near a bathroom.

Learn to recognize the symptoms of urinary infections (UTIs), such as burning
when you urinate, fever, low back pain on one side, and a more frequent need
to urinate. Cranberry tablets may help prevent UTIs.

Some people may need to use a urinary catheter. This is a thin tube that is
inserted into your bladder. You may need a catheter to be:

    * In place all the time (indwelling catheter).
    * In your bladder 4 to 6 times a day to keep your bladder from becoming too full (intermittent catheterization).

Sometimes surgery is needed. Surgeries for neurogenic bladder include:

    * Artificial sphincter
    * Electrical device implanted near the bladder nerves to stimulate the bladder muscles
    * Sling surgery
    * Creation of an opening (stoma) in which urine flows into a special pouch (this is called urinary diversion)

Electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in the leg may be recommended. This
involves placing a needle into the tibial nerve. The needle is connected to an
electrical device that sends signals to the tibial nerve. The signals then
travel up to the nerves in the lower spine, which control the bladder.

## Support Groups

If you are having urinary incontinence, organizations are available for
further information and support.

## Possible Complications

Complications of neurogenic bladder may include:

    * Constant urine leakage that can cause skin to break down and lead to pressure sores
    * Kidney damage if the bladder becomes too full, causing pressure to build up in the tubes leading to the kidneys and in the kidneys themselves
    * Urinary tract infections

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you:

    * Are unable to empty your bladder at all
    * Have signs of a bladder infection (fever, burning when you urinate, frequent urination)
    * Urinate small amounts, frequently

## Alternative Names

Neurogenic detrusor overactivity; NDO; Neurogenic bladder sphincter
dysfunction; NBSD

## Patient Instructions
