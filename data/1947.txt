Tobacco dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder that, like other chronic
diseases, often requires repeated intervention and long-term support.1 The
majority of people who use tobacco want to quit, but most try to quit multiple
times before succeeding.2

Healthcare providers in a variety of settings play a critical role in helping
people quit using tobacco.1 Even brief advice from you can make it much more
likely that your patients will try to quit--and ultimately succeed.1 Evidence-
based treatment--including counseling and cessation medications approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--significantly increases success in
quitting tobacco.1,3 You can make a difference!

Using the resources below, you can help ensure that your patients have the
right tools to begin their quit journeys.

Visit the Health Effects page for more information about the health
consequences of tobacco use.
