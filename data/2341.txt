While the cause or causes of ME/CFS are still unknown, evidence supports a
combination of factors that are thought to contribute to the development of
this illness. These may include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Infection** - some, but not all, patients develop ME/CFS following an acute viral-like illness. It is possible that in some people an infection may lead to changes in the immune system that contribute to the development of ME/CFS. Post-infectious fatigue is recognized to occur in about one in ten people infected with Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus, or _Coxiella burnetti_ (the causative agent of Q fever). People with these infections who had severe symptoms during the acute illness were more likely than those with mild symptoms to later develop an ME/CFS-like illness. Other infections that have been studied in connection with ME/CFS include human herpesviruses, enterovirus, rubella, _Candida albicans_ , bornaviruses, mycoplasma, and retroviruses. However, in ME/CFS, no causal role has been established for a specific infectious agent.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Genetics** - ME/CFS has been observed within some families. This suggests either a possible genetic link or a common environmental exposure (infectious or toxic). Twin studies show higher rates of ME/CFS in identical than fraternal twins. However, specific genetic associations have not been established.

However, associations of specific environmental factors with ME/CFS have not been established.

ME/CFS is a **biological illness,** not a psychologic disorder. Patients with
ME/CFS are neither malingering nor seeking secondary gain. **These patients
have multiple pathophysiological changes that affect multiple systems.** It is
not known whether these changes occur prior to the onset of the illness or as
its consequence. These changes include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Immune system abnormalities** - some people with ME/CFS have impaired natural killer cell function and/or T cell function, chronic higher production of inflammatory cytokines, and in some cases slight increase in some autoantibodies (rheumatic factor, anti-thyroid antibodies, anti-gliadin, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and cold agglutinins).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Cellular metabolism abnormalities** - some people with ME/CFS also appear to have impaired ability to produce energy from the usual "fuel" that cells use to produce energy: oxygen, glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. Exercise studies in adults have revealed impaired oxygen consumption and activation of anaerobic metabolic pathways in the early stages of exercise.

Some patients with ME/CFS have flattened diurnal cortisol profiles compared to healthy people, but their cortisol levels are still within the normal range.

Patients with orthostatic intolerance develop a worsening of symptoms with quiet upright posture and improvement (though not necessarily full resolution) of symptoms with recumbency. Two common forms of orthostatic intolerance experienced by patients with ME/CFS are: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Neurally-mediated hypotension (NMH): an abnormality in the regulation of blood pressure during upright posture. NMH is sometimes also referred to as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasodepressor syncope, vaso-vagal syncope, "the fainting reflex", and delayed orthostatic hypotension.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): an abnormality in the regulation of heart rate in which a change from lying to standing causes an abnormal increase in heart rate; the heart is usually structurally normal.

These two conditions can occur together. Notably, not all patients with NMH or
POTS have ME/CFS, and not all patients with ME/CFS have NMH or POTS.
