#  Monkeypox Virus Infections

## Summary

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease. It occurs mostly in central and western
Africa. Wild rodents and squirrels carry it, but it is called monkeypox
because scientists saw it first in lab monkeys. In 2003, it was reported in
prairie dogs and humans in the U.S.
