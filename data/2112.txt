## Summary

Protein is in every cell in the body. Our bodies need protein from the foods
we eat to build and maintain bones, muscles and skin. We get proteins in our
diet from meat, dairy products, nuts, and certain grains and beans. Proteins
from meat and other animal products are complete proteins. This means they
supply all of the amino acids the body can't make on its own. Most plant
proteins are incomplete. You should eat different types of plant proteins
every day to get all of the amino acids your body needs.

It is important to get enough dietary protein. You need to eat protein every
day, because your body doesn't store it the way it stores fats or
carbohydrates. How much you need depends on your age, sex, health, and level
of physical activity. Most Americans eat enough protein in their diet.
