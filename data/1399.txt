Clean all "high-touch" surfaces everyday

Clean high-touch surfaces in your isolation area ("sick room" and bathroom)
every day; let a caregiver clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in other
areas of the home.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Clean and disinfect:** Routinely clean high-touch surfaces in your "sick room" and bathroom. Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but not your bedroom and bathroom.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person's bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom.

High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops,
doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them**.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **Household cleaners and disinfectants:** Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend keeping the surface wet for several minutes to ensure germs are killed. Many also recommend precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.

Trouble breathing is a more serious symptom that means you should get medical attention.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * **If you are having trouble breathing, seek medical attention, but call first.**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Call your doctor or emergency room before going in and tell them your symptoms. They will tell you what to do.

You don't need to wear the cloth face covering if you are alone. If you can't put on a cloth face covering (because of trouble breathing for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people. This will help protect the people around you.
