## Summary

Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones
at a joint. It also gives shape and support to other parts of your body, such
as your ears, nose and windpipe. Healthy cartilage helps you move by allowing
your bones to glide over each other. It also protects bones by preventing them
from rubbing against each other.

Injured, inflamed, or damaged cartilage can cause symptoms such as pain and
limited movement. It can also lead to joint damage and deformity. Causes of
cartilage problems include

    * Tears and injuries, such as sports injuries
    * Genetic factors 
    * Other disorders, such as some types of arthritis

Osteoarthritis results from breakdown of cartilage.
