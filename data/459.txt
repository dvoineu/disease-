## Summary

Your child spends more time at school than anywhere else except home. Schools
can have a major effect on children's health. Schools can teach children about
health, and promote healthy behaviors. Physical education classes give
children a chance to get exercise.

Schools work to

    * Prevent risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use or bullying and cyberbullying
    * Encourage healthy habits like exercise and healthy eating
    * Deal with specific health problems in students, such as asthma, obesity and infectious diseases

The school building and environment should be a safe and healthy place for
your child.
