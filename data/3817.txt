##### **Q: I just found out I am pregnant. I have stopped drinking now, but I
was drinking in the first few weeks of my pregnancy, before I knew I was
pregnant. What should I do now?**

**A:**  The most important thing is that you have completely stopped drinking
after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop drinking.
Because brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, the sooner you stop
drinking the safer it will be for you and your baby.

If you drank any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your
child's health care provider as soon as possible and share your concerns. Make
sure you get regular prenatal checkups.

##### **Q. What is a "drink"? What if I drink only beer or wine coolers?**

**A:** Drinking any type of alcohol can affect your baby's growth and
development and cause FASDs. This includes all wines, beer, and mixed drinks.
A standard drink is defined as .60 ounces of pure alcohol. This is equivalent
to one 12-ounce beer or wine cooler, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces
of 80 proof distilled spirits (hard liquor). Some drinks, like mixed alcoholic
drinks or malt liquor drinks, might have more alcohol in them than a 12-ounce
beer. There is no safe kind of alcohol. If you have any questions about your
alcohol use and its risks to your health, talk to your health care provider.
You can also visit CDC's website on alcohol.

Go to the Information for Women page for a picture of the types of standard-
sized drinks and the amount of alcohol they contain.

##### **Q: Is it okay to drink a little or at certain times during
pregnancy?**

**A:** There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or
when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time to drink when
you are pregnant. Alcohol can cause problems for your developing baby
throughout your pregnancy, including before you know you are pregnant.

FASDs are preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

women.jpg)

##### **Q: I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine.
Why shouldn 't I drink again during this pregnancy?**

**A:** Every pregnancy is different. Drinking alcohol might affect one baby
more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another
child who is born with problems.

##### **Q: If I drank when I was pregnant, does that mean my baby will have an
FASD?**

**A:** If you drank any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with
your child's health care provider as soon as possible and share your concerns.

You may not know right away if your child has been affected. FASDs include a
range of physical and intellectual disabilities that are not always easy to
identify when a child is a newborn. Some of these effects may not be known
until your child is in school.

There is no cure for FASDs. However, identifying and intervening with children
with these conditions as early as possible can help them to reach their full
potential.

##### **Q: Is it okay to drink alcohol if I am trying to get pregnant?**

**A:** You might be pregnant and not know it yet. You probably won't know you
are pregnant for up to 4 to 6 weeks. This means you might be drinking and
exposing your baby to alcohol without meaning to.

Alcohol use during pregnancy can also lead to miscarriage and stillbirth.

The best advice is to stop drinking alcohol when you start trying to get
pregnant.

##### **Q: If a woman has an FASD, but does not drink during pregnancy, can
her child have an FASD? Are FASDs hereditary?**

**A:** FASDs are not genetic or hereditary. If a woman drinks alcohol during
her pregnancy, her baby can be born with an FASD. But if a woman has an FASD,
her own child cannot have an FASD, unless she drinks alcohol during pregnancy.

##### **Q: Can a father 's drinking cause harm to the baby?**

**A:** How alcohol affects the male sperm is currently being studied. Whatever
the effects are found to be, they are not fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
(FASDs). FASDs are caused specifically by the mother's alcohol use during
pregnancy.

However, the father's role is important. He can help the woman avoid drinking
alcohol during pregnancy. He can encourage her to abstain from alcohol by
avoiding social situations that involve drinking. He can also help her by
avoiding alcohol himself.

##### **Q: I 've tried to stop drinking before, but I just couldn't do it.
Where can I get help?**

**A:** If you cannot stop drinking, contact your doctor, local Alcoholics
Anonymous, or local alcohol treatment center.

Behavioral Health Treatment Services LocatorExternal  
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a
treatment facility locator. This locator helps people find drug and alcohol
treatment programs in their area.

Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.)External  
Alcoholics Anonymous® is a fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common
problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. Locate an A.A.
programExternal near you.

##### **Q: I suspect my child might have an FASD. What should I do?**

**A:** If you think your child might have an FASD, **talk to your child 's
doctor and share your concerns**. Don't wait!

If you or the doctor thinks there could be a problem, **ask the doctor for a
referral to a specialist** (someone who knows about FASDs), such as a
developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, or clinical geneticist. In
some cities, there are clinics whose staffs have special training in
diagnosing and treating children with FASDs. To find doctors and clinics in
your area visit the National and State Resource DirectoryExternal from the
National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS).

At the same time as you ask the doctor for a referral to a specialist, **call
your state or territory 's early intervention program** to request a free
evaluation to find out if your child can get services to help. This is
sometimes called a _Child Find_ evaluation. You do not need to wait for a
doctor's referral or a medical diagnosis to make this call.

Where to call for a free evaluation from the state depends on your child's
age:

Even if your child is not old enough for kindergarten or enrolled in a public
school, call your local elementary school or board of education and ask to
speak with someone who can help you have your child evaluated.
