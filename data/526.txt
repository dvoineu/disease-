## Summary

Exercising is good for you, but sometimes you can injure yourself when you
play sports or exercise. Accidents, poor training practices, or improper gear
can cause them. Some people get hurt because they are not in shape. Not
warming up or stretching enough can also lead to injuries.

The most common sports injuries are

    * Sprains and strains
    * Knee injuries
    * Swollen muscles 
    * Achilles tendon injuries 
    * Pain along the shin bone 
    * Rotator cuff injuries
    * Fractures (broken bones) 
    * Dislocations

If you get hurt, stop playing. Continuing to play or exercise can cause more
harm. Treatment often begins with the RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, and
Elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and speed healing. Other
possible treatments include pain relievers, keeping the injured area from
moving, rehabilitation, and sometimes surgery.
