### Dust Mite Intervention

Halken S, Host A, Niklassen U, Hansen LG, Nielson F, Pedersen S, Osterballe O,
Veggerby C, Poulsen LK. Effect of mattress and pillow encasings on children
with asthma and house dust mite allergy. Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology. 2003;111:169-76.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Participants' homes

**Target Population:**  
Children aged 6-15 years with well managed asthma and house dust mite (HDM)
allergy.

**Program Description:**  
This investigation aimed to determine whether use of mattress and pillow
encasings resulted in effective long-term control of HDM allergen levels,
thereby reducing the need for asthma medication in the children. Children were
randomized to either an active treatment group that was provided mattress and
pillow encasings coated with semipermeable polyurethane or a control group
that received specially constructed cotton placebo mattress and pillow covers
that resembled the active treatment covers. All encasings were delivered
directly from the manufacturer to the patients. During the study, the
encasings were to remain unwashed, and changes in the child's mattress, bed
and bedroom, as well as structural changes in the residence, were not allowed.
Three children in the active group and four children in the placebo group were
excluded during the study when their families could not comply with these
controls or when the child did not take the medications as prescribed. A
clinical evaluation with lung function measurement, adjustment of the
pharmacologic treatment, and dust sampling from the child's mattress occurred
at baseline and every 3 months during the 12-month study period. At inclusion
and during baseline and treatment periods, asthma medication was titrated to
the lowest effective dose of inhaled steroids and B2-agonists on the basis of
symptoms, need for B2-agonists, and peak flow recorded in diaries. Lung
function measurements were determined using spirometry. Diaries were used to
record morning and evening peak expiratory flow symptoms (symptom scores of
0-3 with 0 being no symptoms and 3 being worst case) during night and day. The
number of doses of B2-agonist used on demand were recorded for 2 weeks before
the visits. Forty of the 47 children using inhaled steroids used the same
product during the entire study period. All children used short-acting
B2-agonist as needed during the study period.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled study approach was used.

**Sample Size:**  
The study comprised 60 children with physican-diagnosed asthma, a positive
skin-prick test response to HDM, a positive bronchial provocation test result
with HDM allergen extract, and a measured amount of dust from the child's
mattress.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included reduction in HDM allergen concentrations and
reductions in use of inhaled steroids. Concentrations of total HDM allergens
on mattresses in the active group significantly decreased but not in the
placebo group after 6 and 12 months. The daily dose of inhaled steroids
(budesonide or fluticasone) was reduced by at least 50% in significantly more
children in the active group than in the placebo group (73% vs. 24%, p<.01)
after 12 months. The approximate 50% reduction in inhaled steroid use among
the children in the active treatment group occurred without worsening in
symptoms or lung function or need for rescue medication. Encasing mattresses
and pillows resulted in a significant long-term reduction in both HDM allergen
concentrations on mattresses and in the need for inhaled steroids in children
with asthma and HDM allergy.

Immunology 2003;14:10-17.

**Intervention Setting:**  
This multi-site community-based study was conducted in homes in four
countries: England, Germany, Greece, and Lithuania.

**Target Population:**  
Toddlers and preschoolers who initially were not sensitized to mite allergens
and had at least one parent with atopic symptoms and sensitization were
targeted for this study.

**Program Description:**  
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the reduction of
mite allergen exposure on prevention of sensitization to house dust mites and
development of allergic disease in toddlers and preschoolers age 1.5-5 years
who were at high risk for atopy. All parents received an educational program.
All were given background information about allergies and the higher risk for
their child to develop an allergy. Booklets on environmental influences on
children's health and preventive recommendations were provided to the
intervention group, along with additional oral explanations. A similar
booklet, without information about mattress covers, was distributed to parents
of the children in the control group. The intervention included providing a
special dust mite-impermeable encasement for all beds in the room at home
where the children in the intervention slept. Intervention group parents
received extensive advice about measures to reduce dust mite allergens in the
child's room (carpet removal; hot washing of sheets, pillow, blankets, and
toys; cleaning tips; ventilation; elimination of pets in the room; and
avoidance of cigarette smoking). A healthcare worker visited participants'
homes at 6 months to ensure the encasements were in place and to repeat
instructions for reducing house dust mite allergens. Information about the
child's atopic symptoms was obtained at 6 months in health centers. All the
families in the control group in all four locations received the following
common recommendations: avoid exposure to pets in bedrooms, ensure good
ventilation of rooms, and avoid cigarette smoking. Likewise, information about
the child's atopic symptoms was obtained at the 6-month follow-up. After 12
months, all parents and their children were invited to participate in a
follow-up examination that included a skin-prick test or immunoglobulin E
(IgE) determination and a questionnaire on symptoms.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled study approach was used.

**Sample Size:**  
The study comprised 636 children with a mean age of 3.1 years. Inclusion
criteria included: 1) local residence; 2) a positive parental screening
questionnaire result (history of asthma, atopic eczema, or hay fever) and
positive parental skin-prick test or IgE; 3) no sensitization to mite
allergens at the beginning of the study; and 4) atopic manifestations, such as
bronchial asthma, hay fever, or atopic eczema. Because investigators were
interested in new cases of sensitization to mite allergens, they excluded all
children whose skin prick tests were positive for **D pteronyssinus** or **D
farinae** in the initial screening.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
The primary outcome measure was sensitization to mite allergens as indicated
by skin prick test or specific Ig E. Of the 330 children in the intervention
group, 10 (3%) had sensitization to mite allergens compared with 20 (6.5%), in
the control group, a statistically significant difference. The finding
suggests that a simple program of prevention measures in childhood may reduce
the risk for later development of asthma. The prevalence of atopic clinical
manifestations was available for the 566 children who participated in the
12-month follow-up. Children with sensitization had a higher prevalence of
symptoms of asthma and eczema (two to three times more common) and a higher
prevalence of reported physicians' diagnoses of food allergy and asthma than
non-sensitized children.

### Health Buddy Asthma Intervention

**Article Citation:**  
Guendelman S, Meade K, Benson M, Chen YQ, Samuels S. Improving asthma outcomes
and self-management behaviors of inner-city children: A randomized trial of
the Health Buddy interactive device and an asthma diary. Archives of Pediatric
and Adolescent Medicine 2002;156(2):114-20.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Participants' homes and an outpatient clinic at Children's Hospital Oakland,
Oakland, California

**Target Population:**  
Inner-city children aged 8-16 years with persistent physician-diagnosed
asthma. The child's caregiver had to speak English, and the home had to have
telephone.

**Program Description:**  
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an interactive
health communications device programmed for the management of pediatric
asthma. This approach departs from conventionally delivered asthma education
programs or interactive computer-based educational programs that do not rely
on the interaction between the child and a health professional, educator,
social worker, or other instructor. Health Buddy, programmed for the care of
inner-city children with asthma, monitors asthma symptoms, quality of life,
and self-care and sends information through a secured Web site to the health-
care provider. The hypothesis was that by allowing children an opportunity to
acquire knowledge about asthma and symptom recognition and receive immediate
feedback on their decisions and behaviors, asthma symptoms among Health Buddy
users would decrease. Continued use of the Health Buddy would help to increase
self-care behaviors, which in turn would reduce symptoms.

All children were prescribed daily prevention medication and a quick-relief
medication to use as needed. A nurse conducted a kickoff standardized teaching
session. Each child received a peak flow measuring device and instruction on
its use to establish personal best. They were instructed to take daily peak
flow measurements and to record them in their diary. Children were then
randomized and instructed how to use the assigned tracking method to record
their peak flow readings and symptoms. The intervention children assigned to
Health Buddy were given a demonstration on how to use the device and explained
how to install it at home. The control group used an asthma diary. Each day
the nurse coordinator queried to the intervention children using a standard
Internet browser. The children answered the queries by pressing buttons on the
device. The device automatically telephoned a data processing center at night,
which processed the responses and published them to a secure website the next
day. The nurse coordinator then reviewed the information. Each answer to a
question received immediate feedback from the device: praise for a correct
answer or encouragement to try again. Additionally, asthma facts and trivia
questions that changed daily were included on Health Buddy program to pique
children's curiosity and enhance learning. The dialogs were designed for a
third-grade reading level. By protocol, children had to access the device once
a day. All children were asked to return for two follow-up visits at 6 and 12
weeks during which the nurse interviewed the child and delivered a
standardized teaching session that reinforced peak-flow measurement compliance
with meds and tracking symptoms. A physician examined each child during these
follow-up visits.

**Editor 's Note:**  
Health Buddy was developed by Health Hero Network, Mountain View, California.
The device, connected to a home telephone, can be programmed to present
questions and information on a screen and to record responses. Example of
exchange between the child and Health Buddy: "Hi! Thanks for hanging out with
your Health Buddy today. Your questions are now ready for you. Have you had
any coughing or wheezing in the last day?" If the child answers "Yes": "This
could be a sign that your asthma is acting up. You may need to take your
Albuterol as directed by your doctor when you are coughing and wheezing." If
the answer is "No": "That's great! You must be taking your preventor [sic]
medicine. Did you miss out on any sports, exercise, or play yesterday because
of your asthma?" If child answers "Yes": "Sorry to hear you missed out on some
fun. If your asthma acts up while doing sports, exercise, or play, please talk
to your doctor about this. It is important to know what activities might
trigger your asthma." If the answer is "no": "That is fantastic! Sports and
exercise are fun and healthy."

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled trial design

**Sample Size:**  
Sixty-six participants in the intervention group, and 68 in the control group

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Outcome measures included limitation to activity, peak flow reading in the red
zone (<50% of the personal best) or yellow zone (50%-80% of the personal best)
in the 2 weeks before the interviews, missed school days, and use of health
services because of asthma in the preceding 6 weeks. Children in both arms of
the study reported a decrease in asthma symptoms and decrease in peak flow
readings in the yellow or red zone at 6 weeks and 12 weeks compared with
baseline. Fewer children in the intervention group had peak flow readings in
the yellow or red zone during the 2 weeks before the 6-week follow-up visit
compared with control group children. Children in the intervention group were
less likely to report limitation in activities. The odds of an urgent call for
health services with Health Buddy were 0.43 of the odds of an urgent call with
the asthma diary.

**Availability of Protocol and Materials:**  
The principal investigator of the study plans to replicate this first trial in
a different setting using a health-care plan and local physicians. The
protocol and materials are not available for widespread distribution.

### Inner-City Pediatric Home Intervention

**Article Citation:**  
Carter MC, Perzanowski MS, Raymond A, Platts-Mills TA. Home intervention in
the treatment of asthma among inner-city children. Journal of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology 2001;108(5):732-7.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Participants' homes

**Target Population:**  
Low socioeconomic, inner-city, minority children with asthma

**Program Description:**  
This study investigated whether implementing low-cost measures for indoor
allergen avoidance could reduce the number of sick days and unscheduled visits
to health care facilities for asthma, and thus be considered a treatment for
asthma among inner-city children. An intervention in patients' homes was
hypothesized to affect housekeeping and other aspects of asthma care.
Participants were randomized to one of three groups: an active intervention
group; a placebo group; or a second group. The children were tested for
allergies at the end of the study, ensuring that neither the families nor the
clinic staff knew which patients were allergic. Avoidance measures for the
intervention group included mite-impermeable mattress and pillow covers,
effective roach traps, and instructions to wash the bedding once a week in hot
water. Parents in this group were also given instructions about cleaning
measures to control dust mites and cockroaches. The placebo group received
mite-permeable mattress and pillow covers, ineffective roach traps, and
instructions to continue their normal practice of washing the bedding.
Patients in the intervention and placebo groups were given a peak flow
monitor, peak flow charts, and a history sheet for symptoms and medication
use. They were requested to fill these in for 2 weeks after each home visit.
Children in the control group continued to have their routine medical care
provided at the clinic, but allergen control measures were not discussed. Only
one home visit was conducted 1 year after enrollment in the study for the
control group. The homes of the active and placebo group children were visited
at enrollment for the initial intervention (described above) and again at 3,
8, and 12 months after enrollment to collect dust samples and inspect the
house. The dust samples were sieved and assayed for dust mite, cockroach, and
cat allergen. During follow-up visits mattress covers were checked, and
replaced as needed, up to six cockroach traps were provided, and advice was
given about their placement and about cleaning the house. The homes of
children in the control group were visited for dust collection after 12
months. No intervention occurred in these homes. All the children received
skin tests at the end of the study for dust mite, cockroach, cat, alternaria,
rat, and mouse sensitivities. Hospital and clinic charts were examined, and
the number of unscheduled visits was recorded for a 2-½ year period (1 year
before enrollment and 18 months after enrollment).

**Evaluation Design:**  
A blinded, randomized, controlled study was used that evaluated three groups
of participants: an active intervention group; a placebo group; and a control
group that received no intervention.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 104 children aged 5-16 years who had asthma and whose primary
health care was provided by a clinic in Northwest Atlanta or at an urban
Atlanta pediatric hospital. Children were offered enrollment when they
accessed medical care.

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department visits, acute visits for
asthma, and changes in mite and cockroach allergen levels were the measured
outcomes. Acute visits for asthma among the active intervention group
decreased 33% from a 15-month period (beginning 18 months before enrollment)
to the end of the 15-month period after enrollment. In the placebo group,
acute visits for asthma decreased 30% during the same period. By contrast, in
the control group, acute visits increased by 6%. A combination of
sensitization and significant exposure to dust mite or cockroach allergen was
present in 59% and 43% of the study participants, respectively. A decrease in
allergen concentration was judged substantial if the decrease was 70% or
greater over the four visits. A substantial decrease of mite allergen occurred
only in 37% of the homes with no difference between the active and placebo
groups. Forty-one percent of homes in the intervention group with cockroach
allergens showed significant decrease in such allergens compared with 32% of
homes among the placebo group. Analyzing the outcome for children who were
specifically allergic to mite or cockroach demonstrated a significant effect
for decreased mite allergen but not for cockroach allergen. Children allergic
to and exposed to mites who had a significant decrease in mite allergen
concentration showed a statistically significant decrease in acute visits.
Among the 14 children with mite allergy who had a decrease in visits, the mean
change in mite allergen was -22.4% compared with +30.1% among the 15 children
without a decrease in visits. This statistically significant decrease in acute
visits among children with mite allergy who had a decrease in mite allergen
strongly supports the relevance of allergen avoidance as an objective of
treatment in this population. Although parents reported visible decrease in
numbers of cockroaches, decreases in cockroach allergens were not associated
with change in acute visits.

Harish ZH, Bregante AC, Morgan C, Fann CSJ, Callaghan CM, Witt MA, Levinson
KA, Caspe WB. A comprehensive inner-city asthma program reduces hospital and
emergency room utilization. Annals of Allergy and Asthma Immunology
2001;86:185-189.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Pediatric asthma center in New York City

**Target Population:**  
This research targets inner-city, pediatric asthma patients ages 2-17 and
their parents/caregivers recruited from the pediatric emergency department
(ED) of the Bronx Lebanon Hospital in South Bronx. The hospital serves a
predominantly Hispanic (58%) and African-American (37%) population.

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive asthma
program on ED visits and hospital admission rates in an inner-city pediatric
population. The intervention consisted of three 1-hour visits conducted 2
weeks apart. The activities in the first visit included review of patient
history, asthma regimen with adjustment to the National Asthma Education and
Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines as needed, proper use of a metered dose
inhaler and spacer, and a review of clinical signs of asthma. A computerized
asthma education program was used to present information on asthma
pathogenesis and medications. The second visit included teaching the use of a
peak flow meter for patients over age 5 and instructing the children and
caregivers on use of an asthma emergency plan. Visit three included skin
testing for common perennial and seasonal aeroallergens. Atopic patients
received detailed training in environmental control measures. Mattress and
pillow encasements were provided to patients allergic to dust mites.
Caregivers were encouraged to call program staff any time if symptoms did not
respond to one treatment of inhaled bronchodilators. Patients were given
inhaled and oral corticosteroids to be used only when instructed by the
provider on call.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The evaluation consisted of a prospective randomized controlled trial. A
visiting nurse reviewed medication use and environmental allergens at home.
Questionnaires were sent to each patient's home each month asking a) "Has your
child visited the ED for asthma in the last month?" - if 'yes' the number of
times, b) "Was your child admitted to the hospital for asthma in the last
month?" - if 'yes' the number of days, c) "Did your child miss any school days
because of asthma?" Participants were awarded a lottery ticket for each
completed questionnaire.

**Sample Size:**  
Sixty children were in the treatment group, and 69 were in the control group.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures include ED attendance and hospitalizations. In the first
study year, 32 patients in the treatment group visited the ED 73 times; 46
patients in the control group visited the ED 269 times. The mean number of ED
visits per patient per month was 0.1 in the treatment group and 0.326 for the
control group. The decrease in ED use by treatment patients was statistically
significant for 6 months of the year including the last 4 months. There were
fewer admissions in the treatment group (22) than in the control group (29).
In the second year of the study, the mean number of ED visits per patient per
year was 0.396 for treatment group and 1.0 for the control group, a
statistically significant difference. Also, in the second year, 14 (26%) of
the 53 patients in the treatment group visited the ED at least once, compared
with 32 (53%) of the 60 patients in the first year. In first year, 53% of the
treatment group visited the ED compared with 26% in the second year, and 27%
of the treatment group was admitted to the hospital in the first year compared
with 11% in year 2.

### Sentara's Asthma Disease Management Program

**Article Citation(s):**  
Axelrod RC, Zimbro KS, Chetney RR, Sabol J, Ainsworth VJ. A disease management
program utilizing "life coaches" for children with asthma. Journal of Clinical
Outcomes Management 2001;8:38-42.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Patients' homes

**Target Population:**  
Children with asthma insured by Sentara Health Management referred to the
program by health plan case managers or primary care physicians. Participants
had diagnosed asthma and one or more of the following: 1) one or more hospital
admissions; 2) more than two emergency department visits in a 6-month period;
3) used beta-agonist reliever medications and little or no anti-inflammatory
controller medications.

**Program Description:**  
The program objective was to help children achieve and maintain control of
asthma-related symptoms and to reduce resource use and associated costs.
Sentara's Asthma Disease Management Program used "life coaches" and home-based
strategies to assess, teach, and monitor asthma self-management (defined as
successful use of the treatment plan, successful behavior and/or lifestyle
changes, and decreased use of intensive, higher-cost services) by children and
their caregivers. Life coaches were registered nurses who were certified in
asthma disease management and knowledgeable about community and family
resources. The program provided education and support that promotes optimal
independent functioning to reduce the need for more intensive and higher-cost
services. Once a child was enrolled in the program, the life coach scheduled a
2-3 hour home-care visit, reviewed the child's history, performed a physical
and psychosocial assessment, evaluated past resource use, and assessed
knowledge about asthma management. The life coach determined the child's
asthma severity level and set a return visit pattern with the caregiver
depending on the child's severity level and the family needs. The child was
provided a peak flow meter and instructed in its use at the initial meeting in
the home. After the first in-home meeting, the life coach and the primary care
physician initiated the Asthma Program Treatment Plan, an asthma action plan,
based on the individual needs of the child and caregiver. In later in-home
meetings, the life coach taught the child and caregiver asthma self-
management. Both the child and the caregiver were trained to use the Asthma
Program Treatment Plan, including when to call the life coach when symptoms
intensified or current treatment did not work. Frequently, the life coach
could provide effective telephone intervention, preventing exacerbation of
symptoms. Life coaches were available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to
intervene and assist the child. The goal of asthma education was to increase
compliance with use of appropriate asthma medications and to encourage
children and their caregivers to make comprehensive behavior and lifestyle
changes. After the initial visit, life coaches made routine telephone calls to
monitor the children and to provide early intervention as needed to prevent
complications. During the monthly follow-up calls, life coaches spoke with
both the child (those aged > 6 years and older) and the caregiver to assess
medication use, treatment plan results, number of days missed from school and
work, and success at making home and life-style changes. Children were
followed for 1 year or until self-management was achieved.

**Evaluation Design:**  
Pre-post design

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 294 children participated in the study

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included medication use, hospitalizations, emergency visits,
primary and specialty care visits, and costs. After enrollment, children were
significantly less likely to be admitted to the hospital, a decline of 45%.
Emergency department visits decreased 17% after enrollment, and primary care
visits declined by 19%. No change was seen in visits to allergy or pulmonary
specialists. The beta-agonists-to-anti-inflammatory medication ratio declined
20%. The average health care costs per child per month - including costs of
hospital admissions, emergency visits, primary care and specialist visits,
home health visits and asthma medications - declined by 25%.

### The Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study

**Article Citation(s):**  
Becker A, Watson W, Ferguson A, Dimich-Ward H, Chan-Yeung M. The Canadian
Asthma Primary Prevention Study: outcomes at 2 years of age. J Allergy Clin
Immunol 2004;113(4):651-6.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Homes of study participants

**Target Population:**  
This study focused on a cohort of infants at high-risk for development of
asthma on the basis of an immediate family history of asthma. High-risk
infants were defined as those with at least one first-degree relative with
asthma or two first-degree relatives with other classic IgE-mediated allergic
diseases as identified during the mother's third trimester of pregnancy.

**Program Description:**  
This study sought to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted
intervention program in the primary prevention of asthma in high-risk infants.
The hypothesis was that there existed a potential for long-term modification
of the infant's risk for asthma during this small window of opportunity. After
baseline assessment, a sealed envelope was opened that determined the family's
allocation to the intervention or control group. The control group did not
receive specific information about intervention measures but followed the
usual care recommended by their primary care physicians. Home visits were
carried out during the third trimester of pregnancy, at 2 weeks, and at 4, 8,
12, 18, and 24 months after the birth of the child. Demographic and health
characteristics were gathered through use of a standardized questionnaire.
Home characteristics were assessed using a questionnaire and a walk-through
survey.

The intervention program included the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. The infant's mattress and all mattresses and box springs in the parent's bedroom were encased to limit exposure to house dust mites. Families were instructed to wash all bedding weekly using the hot cycle of their washing machines. Benzyl benzoate powder was applied to carpets in the infant's bedroom, the parent's bedroom, and the most commonly used room. Benzyl benzoate foam was applied to upholstered furniture in the most commonly used room before birth and at 4 and 8 months after birth.

Families were counseled to remove cats, dogs, or both from the home, or to keep pets outside the home, or at least outside the infant's bedroom.

Families were encouraged to avoid daycare until after the first year of life. Nurses reinforced various avoidance measures at each home visit.

Mothers were encouraged to breast feed their infant for at least 4 months and for the first year if possible. Where breast-feeding was not possible, partially hydrolyzed whey formula was supplied until 12 months of age.

During each home visit dust samples were collected from the infant's and
parent's bedroom floors and mattress and the floor and upholstered furniture
in the most commonly used room. Samples were analyzed in duplicate for house
dust mite and cat allergens. Allergens from these sites at each time were
averaged. Each child was seen by a pediatric asthma specialist blinded to the
study group and to compliance with intervention and who did not provide health
care to the families. They examined the child and conducted a structured
interview to record symptoms and physical findings. Allergy skin tests were
conducted using house dust mite (HDM), cat, dog, cockroach, Alternaria species
(fungi), cow's milk, egg white, wheat, soy, and peanut allergens.

The intervention successfully decreased HDM exposure in the first and second
year. There was significantly less cat allergen exposure in intervention homes
at 2 weeks and 4 months. Mothers in the intervention group breast-fed longer
and delayed introduction of solid food longer than mothers in the control
group. Significantly fewer intervention group children were in daycare by 1
year of age. Finally, there was less ETS exposure in intervention homes.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This was a prospective, prenatal, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
Mothers of infants were randomized to an intervention group or a control
group. The study included infants born between October 1994 and August 1996.

**Sample Size:**  
Participants included 545 mothers of 549 high-risk infants for asthma

**Outcome Measures:**  
Prevalence of asthma* and atopy at age 2 years in high-risk infants

**Results:**  
At age 2 years, 19.5% of children in this high-risk cohort satisfied the
criteria of having asthma, and 14.5% had positive skin test responses to at
least one common allergen. At age 2 years, 16.3% of intervention group
children and 23.0% of control children had asthma; 15.6% of children in the
intervention group and 13.7% of control children were atopic. The intervention
had a significant effect on the prevalence of asthma at age 2 years,
decreasing the number of children given a diagnosis of possible and probable
asthma in the intervention group (16.3%) compared with the control group
(23.0%).

The main difference between the control and intervention groups was in the
substantial reduction of persistent asthma, defined as asthma present at both
year 1 and 2, in the intervention group (4.9%) vs. 11.3% for the control
group, a 60% decrease in the intervention group. Recurrent wheeze was defined
as three or more episodes of wheezing, each lasting 1 week or more. At 2 years
of age, significantly fewer children had recurrent wheeze in the intervention
group (1.0%) compared with control group (3.5%). The intervention had its
greatest effect on recurrent wheeze with a 90% reduction in the intervention
group compared with that seen in the control group at 2 years.

*Asthma was defined as the sum of children with a diagnosis of both possible asthma and probable asthma. Possible asthma was defined as at least two distinct episodes of cough each lasting for 2 or more weeks; at least two distinct episodes of wheeze, each lasting 2 or more weeks; or in the absence of a cold, at least one of the following: nocturnal cough (at least once a week) and hyperpnea-induced cough or wheeze. Probable asthma was defined as at least two distinct episodes of cough, each lasting 2 or more weeks, or at least two distinct episodes of wheeze, each lasting 1 or more weeks and one of the following: nocturnal cough lasting a week in the absence of cold, hyperpnea-induced cough or wheeze, response to treatment with B-agonist, anti-inflammatory drugs, or both.

### The Inner-City Asthma Study-Environmental Intervention

**Article Citation(s):**  
Morgan WJ, Crain EF, Gruchalla RS, O'Connor GT, Kattan M, Evans III R, et al.
Results of a home-based environmental intervention among urban children with
asthma. N Engl J Med 2004;351:1068-80.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Study participants' homes

**Target Population:**  
Inner-city children with atopic asthma

**Program Description:**  
The objective of this study was to determine whether an environmental
intervention tailored to each child's allergic sensitization and environmental
risk factors could improve asthma-related outcomes. Previous studies of
environmental interventions for patients with asthma have focused on a single
allergen, such as dust mites or environmental tobacco smoke, rather than on
the multiple exposures encountered by many urban children with asthma.

Eligibility was limited to residents of census tracts in which at least 20% of
households had incomes below the federal poverty level. Eligibility criteria
included at least one asthma-related hospitalization or two unscheduled,
asthma-related visits to the clinic or emergency department during the
previous 6 months and a positive skin test in response to at least 1 of 11
indoor allergens. A baseline clinical evaluation included questionnaires on
complications related to asthma and the home environment, and skin testing was
performed. A baseline home evaluation involved direct visual inspection and
dust collection from the child's bedroom. The home evaluation team collected
separate, vacuumed dust samples from the child's bedroom floor and bed.
Samples were tested for dust mite, cockroach, cat, and dog allergens.

Children were randomly assigned to the control group or the intervention group
by blocked randomization within a site. Families in the control group received
visits only for evaluation at 6-month intervals throughout the study. The goal
of the intervention was to provide the child's caretaker with the knowledge,
skills, motivation, equipment, and supplies to perform comprehensive
environmental remediation. Researchers educated the family regarding the
importance of the mitigation behavior and its effectiveness and modeled the
targeted behavior. Caretakers performed the mitigation behavior while the
environmental counselors provided feedback and encouragement.

The intervention was organized into six modules that focused on remediation of
exposure to dust mites, passive smoking, cockroaches, pets, rodents, and mold.
Intervention activities were tailored to each child's skin-test-sensitization
profile and environmental exposures on the basis of the caretaker's report and
the study staff's observations during the baseline home evaluation. During the
12-month intervention, two research assistants conducted five mandatory and
two optional home visits. All visits were followed by a telephone call to
address any barriers to implementing the remediation plan.

During the first visit, the intervention teams taught the caretaker about the
role of allergens and irritants in the child's asthma. They also introduced
the environmental intervention plan, which included the creation of an
environmentally safe sleeping zone. Allergen-impermeable covers were placed on
the mattress, box spring, and pillows of the child's bed at the first visit.
The teams gave families a vacuum cleaner equipped with a high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filter and instructed them on its use. A HEPA air
purifier was set up in the child's bedroom if the child was exposed to passive
smoking, sensitized and exposed to cat or dog allergens, or sensitized to
mold. Professional pest control was provided for children sensitized and
exposed to cockroach allergen. Follow-up surveys of the home environment and
collection of dust allergens were repeated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to
assess changes in the home environment.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This randomized controlled trial lasted 1 year. It included education and
remediation of exposure to both allergens and environmental tobacco smoke.
Home environmental exposures were assessed every 6 months and asthma-related
complications were assessed every 2 months during the intervention and for 1
year after the intervention. Interviewers conducted standardized telephone
interviews with each child's primary caretaker every 2 months during the year
of the intervention and the year after the intervention. They collected data
on asthma symptoms, medication use, and health care use.

**Sample Size:**  
The sample included 937 children, ages 5-11 years (mean age 7.7 years), in six
major U.S. cities (Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, Seattle-Tacoma, and
Tucson), whose asthma had been diagnosed by a physician at research centers in
those cities. Most of the children were black or of Hispanic descent, as
reported by each child's caretaker.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Children in both groups had a high prevalence of allergic sensitization to
cockroach and dust-mite allergens. Exposure to tobacco smoke and airborne
allergens was common. Detectable levels of cockroach allergens were found in
68.4% of bedrooms. Dust-mite allergens were found in 84.1% of bedrooms.
Additionally, 76.8% of children sensitive to cockroach and 86.7% of those
sensitive to dust-mite allergen had detectable levels of these allergens in
their bedrooms. Home environmental interventions resulted in significantly
fewer dust-mite allergens in the bed and cockroach and dust-mite allergens on
the child's bedroom floor. Those improvements remained significantly higher
for the intervention group in the second year.

The primary health outcome was the maximal number of days with asthma symptoms
in the 2 weeks before the telephone interview (conducted every 2 months for 2
years). Symptom days were defined as the largest value among the following
three variables:

The intervention group reported significantly fewer symptoms of asthma during
the intervention year and the follow-up year. The maximal number of days with
symptoms was lower in the intervention group by 0.82 day per 2-week period in
the first year and 0.60 day per 2-week period in the second year. This
observed reduction in symptoms translates into 34 fewer days with reported
wheeze during the 2 years of the study among children in the intervention
group compared with those in the control group. The interventions also helped
significantly reduce disruptions of caretakers' plans, caretakers' and
children's lost sleep, and school days missed by the children in the
intervention group. The intervention resulted in 13.6% fewer unscheduled
visits for asthma per year, 19.3 fewer days with symptoms per year, and 20.7%
fewer missed school days per year.

### United Healthcare Asthma Management Program

**Article Citation(s):**  
Georgiou A, Buchner D, Ershoff DH, Blasko KM, Goodman LV, Feigin J. The impact
of a large-scale population-based asthma management program on pediatric
asthma patients and their caregivers. Annals of Allergy, Asthma, and
Immunology. 2003;90:308-15.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Participants' homes

**Target Population:**  
Children aged 5-3 years with asthma in the United States whose families were
covered by the United Health Plans were eligible for this study.

**Program Description:**  
The objective of this study was to determine the impact of an asthma
management program on pediatric patients with asthma and their caregivers over
a 12-month period. In this longitudinal study, 401 randomly selected
households with children with asthma completed a survey questionnaire before
and after 12 months of participation in the Asthma Management Program.
Information collected included daytime and nighttime asthma symptoms,
functional impact of the disease, interference attributable to treatment, and
impact on family activities. In addition to seeking information from
caregivers on process measures (such as the use of written action plans,
knowledge about asthma triggers, attack management, use of a peak flow meter),
caregivers were questioned about lost work and lost school days related to
their child's asthma. Additional information about participants was
supplemented by asthma-related medical care use obtained from the computerized
claims database.

The Asthma Management Program interventions were tailored to each child's
asthma health risk and need as determined from medical records, filled
prescriptions, and the self-reported survey. The interventions for all
participants consisted of an educational booklet, asthma treatment guides and
seasonal and quarterly mailings about asthma-related issues (called
"educational touches"), and an asthma control kit that included a peak flow
meter and an educational video. All "high-needs" asthma patients were offered
one-on-one asthma education and intensive "telephonic care management"
conducted by registered nurses and respiratory therapists. Telephonic care
managers provided feedback to patients' physicians when appropriate.
Additionally, all high-risk members received an asthma control kit that
included a peak flow meter and an educational video. All physicians were given
a list of their identified asthma patients, including a medication and
utilization history, and were provided copies of the NAEPP guidelines.
Physicians of high-risk members were sent a letter regarding their patients'
involvement in the program and were encouraged to provide these patients with
asthma action plans.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A one-group pretest-posttest design was used with a comparison of responses to
questionnaire items before and after exposure to the asthma health management
program.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 1,003 patients were randomly sampled from a group of 3,585 patients
in 17 regional health-care districts. Only 401 patients' families completed
the study.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures related to the child's health included daytime symptoms,
nighttime symptoms, functional limitation, life interruptions resulting from
treatment, impact on family activity, emergency or inpatient care for asthma,
and missed school days. Caregiver measures included missed workdays because of
the child's asthma. Data indicated higher post intervention scores on all of
the child's quality of life parameters. The largest improvement was detected
for nighttime symptoms (a gain of 5.8 points), the smallest change was
detected for daytime symptoms (2.4 points). The proportion of children
classified as having mild symptoms based on frequency of reported symptoms
increased from 66.9% at baseline to 75.3% at follow-up. The percentage of
patients requiring inpatient admission or emergency care decreased
significantly, (9.7% vs. 5.5%) according to claims data from the baseline year
and the 12-month period of intervention preceding the follow-up. The
percentage of children who missed one or more school days because of asthma
decreased significantly from 36% to 23%. Forty-eight (17.1%) working
caregivers reported having missed 1 or more days from work during the previous
4-week period because of the child's asthma in the preintervention period;
this figure decreased to 27 (9.6%) at follow-up. Of the 48 respondents
reporting 1 or more missed workdays at baseline, 38 reported no missed days at
follow-up. The mean annualized number of caregiver workdays missed because of
asthma care fell from 3.8 days at baseline to 1.8 days at follow-up. This
computed to a baseline annual mean of 30.5 missed hours per employed primary
caregiver of an child with asthma, compared with 14.4 hours per year at
follow-up. The estimated indirect costs related to lost caregiver work time
suggested a savings of $327.00 per employed caregiver resulting from the
reduction in lost work hours.

In 2003, this program was implemented in over 30 United Healthcare Plans.

### Wee Wheezers at Home

Brown JV, Bakeman R, Celano MP, Demi AS, Kobrynski L, Wilson SR. Home-based
asthma education of young low-income children and their families. Journal of
Pediatric Psychology 2002;27(8):677-88.

**Intervention Setting:**  
The home of the patient's caregiver

**Target Population:**  
Inner-city African-American children aged less than 7 years from low-income
families in metro Atlanta, Georgia, who made a health care visit for asthma in
the preceding year, who had been prescribed medication for asthma for daily
use, and whose primary caregiver spoke English.

**Program Description:**  
Families were recruited for the study during clinic visits or by invitation
letters and telephone calls. Participants were paid $75 for three study-
related visits by a social worker including induction and two follow-up data
collection visits. Researchers had previously adapted and piloted the Wee
Wheezers education program (Wilson et. al. 1993/94) before its use with the
study's intervention group. The Wee Wheezers teaching script was modified for
use with individual families, handouts were tailored to low-literacy and child
audience, and the instructors delivered the content over eight sessions rather
than the four used in Wee Wheezers. The revised program emphasized specific
content areas, such as the developmentally appropriate level of participation
of young children in asthma management.

Wee Wheezers at Home (WWH) consists of eight 90-minute education sessions
provided at weekly intervals. Registered nurses conducted the course in the
participants' homes. Each session consisted of the completion of a checklist
of the child's asthma symptoms for the previous week, a discussion of the
previous week's homework assignment, an overview of the day's session, the
session topics (about 1 hour total), a review of concepts learned that day,
and assignment of homework.

Session topics were:

Review of communication about asthma.

Caregiver and child activities included tracing the airflow on a picture of a
child with the lungs drawn, identifying and coloring asthma cues and
environmental triggers in a coloring book, practicing belly breathing, keeping
an asthma diary, watching videos about asthma management, and practicing the
use of a peak flow meter. At each session, the home visitor used a set of
prepared questions based on the educational objectives to assess caregivers'
and children's understanding of the material. Caregiver responses were used to
guide the instruction in subsequent sessions. Families received printed
materials and homework at each session and videotapes at some sessions. The
same nurse conducted all eight sessions with a given family. The usual-care
group was offered asthma training after the study was completed.

**Evaluation Design:**  
A randomized controlled study approach was used.

**Sample Size:**  
A total of 95 children were recruited primarily from three asthma specialty
clinics.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included asthma symptoms, symptom-free days, acute asthma
visits, and caregiver quality of life (QoL). The intervention was effective
for younger children in the areas of morbidity and caregiver QoL. Researchers
used the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Juniper, 1996a) to
assess QoL with three measures: a rating of how much children were bothered by
asthma symptoms, the number of symptom-free days, and the number of medical
visits for acute asthma exacerbations. Intervention children ages 1-3 were
bothered less than usual-care children by asthma symptoms at 3- and 12-month
follow-up visits. Older intervention children and the usual-care children were
basically unchanged. Symptom-free days increased significantly for younger
intervention children (from 37 days at baseline to 154 at 12 months) but not
for older intervention children. No intervention effects were noted in the
number of medical visits for acute asthma care for the 12 months preceding
baseline and the period between baseline and the 12-month visit. Researchers
also used the Caregiver Quality of Life (adapted from Juniper 1996b).
Caregivers of younger intervention children were bothered significantly less
than caregivers of usual-care children and older intervention children because
of the child's condition following the intervention. Measures of caretakers
being bothered by the child's asthma were 1=never bothered and 2=bothered 1-2
days per week or very little. The mean for caretakers of younger intervention
children over time was 1.90, 1.37, and 1.17. No significant treatment effect
existed in the older intervention children or usual-care children. Asthma
management practices were assessed by parameters such as 1) adherence to the
prescribed medical regimen for asthma on a previous day, 2) administration of
asthma medication promptly with the signs of an upper respiratory infection,
3) identification of coughing or stuffy or runny nose among the earliest signs
of asthma, 4) caretaker report of the frequency of 16 symptom management and
prevention practices, 5) caretaker report of the level of child participation
in each of the tasks required in asthma self-management. The intervention did
not produce statistically significant improvement in asthma management
behaviors.

**Availability of Protocol/Materials:**  
The Wee Wheezers at Home materials are available in a program kit distributed
by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of AmericaExternal.

**Case Study:**  
None
