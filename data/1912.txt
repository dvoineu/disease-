## Summary

Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes developmental and nervous
system problems, mostly in girls. It's related to autism spectrum disorder.
Babies with Rett syndrome seem to grow and develop normally at first. Between
3 months and 3 years of age, though, they stop developing and even lose some
skills. Symptoms include

    * Loss of speech
    * Loss of hand movements such as grasping
    * Compulsive movements such as hand wringing
    * Balance problems
    * Breathing problems
    * Behavior problems
    * Learning problems or intellectual disability

Rett syndrome has no cure. You can treat some of the symptoms with medicines,
surgery, and physical and speech therapy. Most people with Rett syndrome live
into middle age and beyond. They will usually need care throughout their
lives.
