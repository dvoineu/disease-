# HECAT: A Guide for Health Education Teacher Preparation Programs in
Institutions of Higher Education

Minus

Related Pages

CDC developed a pre-service training guide, _Health Education Curriculum
Analysis Tool: A Guide for Health Education Teacher Preparation Programs in
Institutions of Higher Education_ , to help future health education teachers
understand how they can improve health instruction and curriculum selection
using the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool (HECAT).

The guide and accompanying presentation materials are designed for use by
college and university instructors in health and physical education
professional teacher preparation programs. The lessons can be used for upper-
division undergraduate, pre-service courses that focus on health education
curricula and instruction, as well as for graduate-level health education
courses.

Lessons 1 - 5 introduce the knowledge and skills prerequisite for analyzing a
written single or multiple grade-level health education curricula, and then
using those skills and the HECAT tools to analyze a curriculum. Lesson 6 helps
apply the elements of the HECAT to help students develop their own health
education unit plans for use in the classroom.
