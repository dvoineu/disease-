Scrotal swelling is abnormal enlargement of the scrotum. This is the name for
the sac surrounding the testicles.

## Considerations

Scrotal swelling can occur in males at any age. The swelling can be on one or
both sides, and there may be pain. The testicles and penis may or may not be
involved.

In testicular torsion, the testicle becomes twisted in the scrotum and loses
its blood supply. It is a serious emergency. If this twisting is not relieved
quickly, the testicle may be permanently lost. This condition is extremely
painful. Call 911 or see your health care provider immediately. Losing blood
supply for just a few hours can cause tissue death and the loss of a testicle.

## Causes

Causes of scrotal swelling include:

    * Certain medical treatments
    * Congestive heart failure
    * Epididymitis
    * Hernia
    * Hydrocele
    * Injury
    * Orchitis
    * Surgery in the genital area
    * Testicular torsion
    * Varicocele
    * Testicular cancer 
    * Fluid retention

## Home Care

Things you can do to help this problem include:

    * Apply ice packs to the scrotum for the first 24 hours, followed by sitz baths to decrease swelling.
    * Elevate scrotum by placing a rolled up towel between your legs. It will help relieve pain and swelling.
    * Wear a loose-fitting athletic supporter for daily activities.
    * Avoid excessive activity until the swelling disappears.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if:

    * You notice any unexplained scrotal swelling. 
    * The swelling is painful. 
    * You have a testicle lump. 

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will perform a physical exam and take a medical history, which
may include the following questions:

    * When did the swelling develop? Did it come on suddenly? Is it getting worse?
    * How big is the swelling (try to describe in terms such as "twice normal size" or "the size of a golf ball")?
    * Does the swelling appear to be fluid? Can you feel tissue in the swollen area?
    * Is the swelling in one part of the scrotum or in the entire scrotum?
    * Is the swelling the same on both sides (sometimes a swollen scrotum is actually an enlarged testicle, a testicular lump, or a swollen duct)?
    * Have you had surgery, injury, or trauma in the genital area?
    * Have you had a recent genital infection?
    * Does the swelling go down after you rest in bed?
    * Do you have any other symptoms?
    * Is there any pain in the area around the scrotum?

The physical exam will most likely include a detailed exam of the scrotum,
testicles, and penis. The combination of a physical exam and history will
determine whether you need any tests.

Your provider may prescribe antibiotics and pain medicines, or recommend
surgery. A scrotal ultrasound may be done to find where the swelling is
occurring.
