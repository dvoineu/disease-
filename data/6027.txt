###  Gonococcal Infections in Adolescents and Adults

In the United States, an estimated 820,000 new _N. gonorrhoeae_ infections
occur each year ( _533_ ). Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported
communicable disease ( _118_ ). Urethral infections caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_
among men can produce symptoms that cause them to seek curative treatment soon
enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission
to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or
might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications (e.g., PID) have
occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility and
ectopic pregnancy.

Annual screening for _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection is recommended for all
sexually active women aged <25 years and for older women at increased risk for
infection (e.g., those who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner,
a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) (
_108_ ). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include inconsistent condom use
among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships, previous or
coexisting sexually transmitted infections, and exchanging sex for money or
drugs. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and might opt to
consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups at
increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in
specific geographic locations and communities. Subgroups of MSM are at high
risk for gonorrhea infection and should be screened at sites of exposure (see
MSM). Screening for gonorrhea in men and older women who are at low risk for
infection is not recommended ( _108_ ). A recent travel history with sexual
contacts outside of the United States should be part of any gonorrhea
evaluation.

####  Diagnostic Considerations

Specific microbiologic diagnosis of infection with _N. gonorrhoeae_ should be
performed in all persons at risk for or suspected to have gonorrhea; a
specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, reinfections, and
transmission. Culture and NAAT are available for the detection of
genitourinary infection with _N. gonorrhoeae (394)_; culture requires
endocervical (women) or urethral (men) swab specimens. NAAT allows for the
widest variety of FDA-cleared specimen types, including endocervical swabs,
vaginal swabs, urethral swabs (men), and urine (from both men and women).
However, product inserts for each NAAT manufacturer must be carefully
consulted because collection methods and specimen types vary. Culture is
available for detection of rectal, oropharyngeal, and conjunctival gonococcal
infection, but NAAT is not FDA-cleared for use with these specimens. Some
laboratories have met CLIA regulatory requirements and established performance
specifications for using NAAT with rectal and oropharyngeal swab specimens
that can inform clinical management. Certain NAATs that have been demonstrated
to detect commensal _Neisseria_ species might have comparable low specificity
when testing oropharyngeal specimens for _N gonorrhoeae (394)_. The
sensitivity of NAAT for the detection of _N. gonorrhoeae_ in urogenital and
nongenital anatomic sites is superior to culture, but varies by NAAT type (
_394,505-508_). In cases of suspected or documented treatment failure,
clinicians should perform both culture and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing because nonculture tests cannot provide antimicrobial susceptibility
results. Because _N. gonorrhoeae_ has demanding nutritional and environmental
growth requirements, optimal recovery rates are achieved when specimens are
inoculated directly and when the growth medium is promptly incubated in an
increased CO2 environment ( _394_ ). Several non-nutritive swab transport
systems are available that might maintain gonococcal viability for up to 48
hours in ambient temperatures ( _534-536_ ).

Because of its high specificity (>99%) and sensitivity (>95%), a Gram stain of
urethral secretions that demonstrates polymorphonuclear leukocytes with
intracellular Gram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for
infection with _N. gonorrhoeae_ in symptomatic men. However, because of lower
sensitivity, a negative Gram stain should not be considered sufficient for
ruling out infection in asymptomatic men. Detection of infection using Gram
stain of endocervical, pharyngeal, and rectal specimens also is insufficient
and is not recommended. MB/GV stain of urethral secretions is an alternative
point-of-care diagnostic test with performance characteristics similar to Gram
stain. Presumed gonococcal infection is established by documenting the
presence of WBC containing intracellular purple diplococci in MB/GV smears.

#### Antimicrobial-Resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_

Gonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to
develop resistance to antimicrobials ( _537_ ). In 1986, the Gonococcal
Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), a national sentinel surveillance system,
was established to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of
urethral _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains in the United States ( _538_ ). The
epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides decisions about gonococcal
treatment recommendations and has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial
resistance patterns. In 2007, emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant _N.
gonorrhoeae_ in the United States prompted CDC to cease recommending
fluoroquinolones for treatment of gonorrhea, leaving cephalosporins as the
only remaining class of antimicrobials available for treatment of gonorrhea in
the United States ( _539_ ). Reflecting concern about emerging gonococcal
resistance, CDC's 2010 STD treatment guidelines recommended dual therapy for
gonorrhea with a cephalosporin plus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even
if NAAT for _C. trachomatis_ was negative at the time of treatment ( _1_ ).
However, during 2006-2011, the minimum concentrations of cefixime needed to
inhibit in vitro growth of the _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains circulating in the
United States and many other countries increased, suggesting that the
effectiveness of cefixime might be waning ( _118,540_). In addition, treatment
failures with cefixime or other oral cephalosporins have been reported in Asia
( _541-544_ ), Europe ( _545-549_ ) _,_ South Africa ( _550_ ), and Canada (
_551,552_ ). Ceftriaxone treatment failures for pharyngeal infections have
been reported in Australia ( _553,554_ ), Japan ( _555_ ), and Europe (
_556,557_ ). As a result, CDC no longer recommends the routine use of cefixime
as a first-line regimen for treatment of gonorrhea in the United States (
_540_ ). In addition, U.S. gonococcal strains with elevated MICs to cefixime
also are likely to be resistant to tetracyclines but susceptible to
azithromycin ( _540_ ). Consequently, only one regimen, dual treatment with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, is recommended for treatment of gonorrhea in the
United States. CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp) and state health departments
can provide the most current information on gonococcal susceptibility.

Criteria for resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone have not been defined by
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, isolates with
cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs ≥0.5 _µ_ g/mL are considered to have decreased
susceptibility ( _558_ ). In the United States, the proportion of isolates in
GISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime has
remained low; during 2013, no isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC _>_
0.5 ug/mL) to ceftriaxone or cefixime were identified ( _118_ ). Because
increasing MICs might predict the emergence of resistance, GISP established
lower cephalosporin MIC breakpoints than those set by CLSI to provide greater
sensitivity in detecting declining gonococcal susceptibility for surveillance
purposes. The percentage of isolates with cefixime MICs ≥0.25 _µ_ g/mL
increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 1.4% in 2011 ( _118,540_), and declined to 0.4%
in 2013 ( _118_ ). The percentage of isolates with ceftriaxone MICs ≥0.125 _µ_
g/mL increased from <0.1% in 2006 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.05% in
2013. Isolates with high-level cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs (cefixime MICs
1.5-8 _µ_ g/mL and ceftriaxone MICs 1.5-4 _µ_ g/mL) have been identified in
Japan ( _555_ ), France ( _549_ ), and Spain ( _559,560_ ). Decreased
susceptibility of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials
is expected to continue; state and local surveillance for antimicrobial
resistance is crucial for guiding local therapy recommendations ( _537_ ).
Although approximately 3% of all U.S. men who have gonococcal infections are
sampled through GISP, surveillance by clinicians also is critical. Clinicians
who diagnose _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection in a person with suspected
cephalosporin treatment failure should perform culture and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) of relevant clinical specimens, consult an
infectious-disease specialist for guidance in clinical management, and report
the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities. Isolates
should be saved and sent to CDC through local and state public health
laboratory mechanisms. Health departments should prioritize notification and
culture evaluation for sexual partner(s) of persons with _N. gonorrhoeae_
infection thought to be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or
persons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility to cephalosporin.

#### Dual Therapy for Gonococcal Infections

On the basis of experience with other microbes that have developed
antimicrobial resistance rapidly, a theoretical basis exists for combination
therapy using two antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action (e.g., a
cephalosporin plus azithromycin) to improve treatment efficacy and potentially
slow the emergence and spread of resistance to cephalosporins. Use of
azithromycin as the second antimicrobial is preferred to doxycycline because
of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the
substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than
to azithromycin among GISP isolates, particularly in strains with elevated
cefixime MICs ( _118,540_). In addition, clinical trials have demonstrated the
efficacy of azithromycin 1 g for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital GC
( _561,562_ ).

Limited data suggest that dual treatment with azithromycin might enhance
treatment efficacy for pharyngeal infection when using oral cephalosporins (
_563,564_ ). In addition, persons infected with _N. gonorrhoeae_ frequently
are coinfected with _C. trachomatis_ ; this finding has led to the
longstanding recommendation that persons treated for gonococcal infection also
be treated with a regimen that is effective against uncomplicated genital _C.
trachomatis_ infection, further supporting the use of dual therapy that
includes azithromycin ( _565_ ).

As dual therapy, ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together
on the same day, preferably simultaneously and under direct observation.
Ceftriaxone in a single injection of 250 mg provides sustained, high
bactericidal levels in the blood. Extensive clinical experience indicates that
ceftriaxone is safe and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea
at all anatomic sites, curing 99.2% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal
and 98.9% of pharyngeal infections in clinical trials ( _566,567_ ). No
clinical data exist to support use of doses of ceftriaxone >250 mg.

Single-dose injectable cephalosporin regimens (other than ceftriaxone 250 mg
IM) that are safe and generally effective against uncomplicated urogenital and
anorectal gonococcal infections include ceftizoxime (500 mg IM), cefoxitin (2
g IM with probenecid 1 g orally), and cefotaxime (500 mg IM). None of these
injectable cephalosporins offer any advantage over ceftriaxone for urogenital
infection, and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain ( _566,567_
). Several other antimicrobials are active against _N. gonorrhoeae_ , but none
have substantial advantages over the recommended regimen, and efficacy data
(especially for pharyngeal infection) are limited.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Azithromycin** 1 g orally in a single dose

A 400-mg oral dose of cefixime should only be considered as an alternative
cephalosporin regimen because it does not provide as high, nor as sustained,
bactericidal blood levels as a 250-mg dose of ceftriaxone; further, it
demonstrates limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3%
cure; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74.9%-99.1%); in older clinical studies,
cefixime cured 97.5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal
infections (95% CI = 95.4%-99.8%) ( _566,567_ ). The increase in the
prevalence of isolates obtained through GISP with elevated cefixime MICs might
indicate early stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal
resistance to cephalosporins. CDC anticipates that rising cefixime MICs soon
will result in declining effectiveness of cefixime for the treatment of
urogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes less effective,
continued used of cefixime might hasten the development of resistance to
ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, injectable cephalosporin and the last
antimicrobial known to be highly effective in a single dose for treatment of
gonorrhea at all anatomic sites of infection. Other oral cephalosporins (e.g.,
cefpodoxime and cefuroxime) are not recommended because of inferior efficacy
and less favorable pharmacodynamics ( _566,568_).

Because of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance among GISP isolates,
particularly those with elevated cefixime MICs ( _118_ ), the use of
azithromycin as the second antimicrobial is preferred. However, in the case of
azithromycin allergy, doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) can
be used in place of azithromycin as an alternative second antimicrobial when
used in combination with ceftriaxone or cefixime.

In a recent clinical trial, dual treatment of uncomplicated, urogenital
gonorrhea with single doses of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg plus oral azithromycin
2 g was associated with cure rates of 99.5% (lower one-sided 95% CI bound =
97.6%), and dual treatment with single doses of intramuscular gentamicin 240
mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100% of cases (lower one-sided 95% CI
bound = 98.5%) ( _569_ ). This trial was not powered to provide reliable
estimates of the efficacy of these regimens for treatment of rectal or
pharyngeal infection, but both regimens cured the few extragenital infections
among study participants. Either of these regimens might be considered as
alternative treatment options in the presence of cephalosporin allergy.
However, gastrointestinal adverse events might limit their use: 7.7% of
patients treated with gemifloxacin plus azithromycin and 3.3% of patients
treated with gentamicin plus azithromycin vomited within 1 hour of medication
administration, necessitating retreatment with a ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

Spectinomycin, which is useful in persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins,
is expensive, has poor efficacy against pharyngeal infection (51.8%; 95% CI =
38.7%-64.9%) ( _566_ ), and is not being produced in the United States ( _570_
). However, it has been effective in clinical trials, curing 98.2% of
uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections ( _566_ ). When
available, spectinomycin is an effective alternative for the treatment of
urogenital and anorectal infection.

Monotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose has been
demonstrated to be 99.2% effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea
(95% CI = 97.3%-99.9%) ( _567_ ). However, monotherapy is no longer
recommended because of concerns over the ease with which _N. gonorrhoeae_ can
develop resistance to macrolides, and because several studies have documented
azithromycin treatment failures ( _546,571-574_). Strains of _N. gonorrhoeae_
circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible to
penicillins, tetracyclines, and older macrolides (e.g., erythromycin), and
thus use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended.

#### Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections of the Pharynx

Most gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be
relatively common in some populations ( _505,506,575,576_). Gonococcal
infections of the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than are infections
at urogenital and anorectal sites ( _551_ ). Few antimicrobial regimens,
including those involving oral cephalosporins, can reliably cure >90% of
gonococcal pharyngeal infections ( _566,567_ ). Providers should ask their
patients with urogenital or rectal GC about oral sexual exposure; if reported,
patients should be treated with a regimen with acceptable efficacy against
pharyngeal gonorrhea infection.

PLUS

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Azithromycin** 1 g orally in a single dose

#### Other Management Considerations

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and
transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on site
and directly observed. If medications are not available when treatment is
indicated, linkage to an STD treatment facility should be provided for same-
day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea
should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after
treatment and until all sex partners are adequately treated (7 days after
receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). All persons who
receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STDs, including
chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV.

####  Follow-Up

A test-of-cure is not needed for persons who receive a diagnosis of
uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the
recommended or alternative regimens; however, any person with pharyngeal
gonorrhea who is treated with an alternative regimen should return 14 days
after treatment for a test-of cure using either culture or NAAT. If the NAAT
is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before
retreatment. All positive cultures for test-of-cure should undergo
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for _N.
gonorrhoeae_ (with or without simultaneous NAAT), and any gonococci isolated
should be tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis,
cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see
Urethritis, Cervicitis, and Proctitis sections).

A high prevalence of _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection has been observed among men
and women previously treated for gonorrhea ( _86,480,481,577_). Rather than
signaling treatment failure, most of these infections result from reinfection
caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of
sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved
patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been
treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless
of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3
months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next present
for medical care within 12 months following initial treatment.

####  Management of Sex Partners

Recent sex partners (i.e., persons having sexual contact with the infected
patient within the 60 days preceding onset of symptoms or gonorrhea diagnosis)
should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive dual treatment. If
the patient's last potential sexual exposure was >60 days before onset of
symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. To avoid
reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from unprotected
sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sexual partner(s) have
completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

For heterosexual men and women with gonorrhea for whom health department
partner-management strategies are impractical or unavailable and whose
providers are concerned about partners' access to prompt clinical evaluation
and treatment, EPT with cefixime 400 mg and azithromycin 1 g can be delivered
to the partner by the patient, a disease investigation specialist, or a
collaborating pharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). With this
approach, provision of medication must be accompanied by written materials (
_93,95_) to educate partners about their exposure to gonorrhea, the importance
of therapy, and when to seek clinical evaluation for adverse reactions or
complications. Educational materials for female partners should include
information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation for PID
(especially if symptomatic); undertreatment of PID in female partners and
missed opportunities to diagnose other STDs in women are of concern. EPT
should not be considered a routine partner management strategy in MSM with
gonorrhea because of a high risk for coexisting infections (especially HIV
infection) and because no data exist on efficacy in this population.

#### Special Considerations

##### Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions to first-generation cephalosporins occur in <2.5% of
persons with a history of penicillin allergy and are uncommon with third-
generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefixime) ( _428,430,464)_.
Use of ceftriaxone or cefixime is contraindicated in persons with a history of
an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens Johnson
syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) ( _428,431_). Data are limited
regarding alternative regimens for treating gonorrhea among persons who have
either a cephalosporin or IgE-mediated penicillin allergy. Potential
therapeutic options are dual treatment with single doses of oral gemifloxacin
320 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g or dual treatment with single doses of
intramuscular gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g ( _569_ ).
Spectinomycin for treatment of urogenital and anorectal gonorrhea can be
considered when available. Providers treating persons with cephalosporin or
IgE-mediated penicillin allergy should consult an infectious-disease
specialist.

#####  Pregnancy

Pregnant women infected with _N. gonorrhoeae_ should be treated with dual
therapy consisting of ceftriaxone 250 mg in a single IM dose and azithromycin
1 g orally as a single dose. When cephalosporin allergy or other
considerations preclude treatment with this regimen and spectinomycin is not
available, consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is recommended.

##### HIV Infection

Persons who have gonorrhea and HIV infection should receive the same treatment
regimen as those who are HIV negative. For more information, see appropriate
treatment sections under Gonoccocal Infections.

##### Suspected Cephalosporin Treatment Failure

Cephalosporin treatment failure is the persistence of _N. gonorrhoeae_
infection despite appropriate cephalosporin treatment and is indicative of
infection with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea in persons whose partners
were adequately treated and whose risk for reinfection is low. Suspected
treatment failure has been reported among persons receiving oral and
injectable cephalosporins ( _541-557,578_). Treatment failure should be
considered in 1) persons whose symptoms do not resolve within 3-5 days after
appropriate treatment and report no sexual contact during the post-treatment
follow-up period and 2) persons with a positive test-of-cure (i.e., positive
culture _>_ 72 hours or positive NAAT ≥7 days after receiving recommended
treatment) when no sexual contact is reported during the post-treatment
follow-up period ( _579_ ). Treatment failure should also be considered in
persons who have a positive culture on test-of-cure (if obtained) if there is
evidence of decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins on antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, regardless of whether sexual contact is reported
during the post-treatment follow-up period.

Most suspected treatment failures in the United States are likely to be re-
infections rather than actual treatment failures ( _86,480,481,577_). However,
in cases where reinfection is unlikely and treatment failure is suspected,
before retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture
(preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
if _N. gonorrhoeae_ is isolated. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility
testing should be performed using disk diffusion, Etest (BioMerieux, Durham,
NC), or agar dilution. Data are limited on the use of DNA amplification and
sequencing for detection of genetic mutations associated with gonococcal
antimicrobial resistance. All isolates of suspected treatment failures should
be sent to CDC for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution;
local laboratories should store isolates for possible further testing if
needed. Testing and/or storage of specimens or isolates should be facilitated
by the state or local health department according to local public health
protocol. Instructions for shipping isolates to CDC are available at
www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/specimen_shipping_instructions1-29-08.pdfCdc-
pdf.

For persons with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, the treating
clinician should consult an infectious-disease specialist, an STD/HIV
Prevention Training Center clinical expert (http://www.nnptc.orgExternal), the
local or state health department STD program, or CDC (telephone: 404-718-5447)
for advice on obtaining cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and
treatment. Suspected treatment failure should be reported to CDC through the
local or state health department within 24 hours of diagnosis.

Suspected treatment failures first should be retreated routinely with the
recommended regimen (ceftriaxone 250 mg IM plus azithromycin 1 g orally),
because reinfections are more likely than actual treatment failures. However,
in situations with a higher likelihood of treatment failure than reinfection,
relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably with
simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed before
retreatment. Dual treatment with single doses of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg plus
oral azithromycin 2 g or dual treatment with single doses of intramuscular
gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be considered, particularly
when isolates are found to have elevated cephalosporin MICs ( _569_ ). Persons
with suspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative regimen
(cefixime and azithromycin) should be treated with ceftriaxone 250 mg as a
single IM dose and azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose. A test-of-cure at
relevant clinical sites should be obtained 7-14 days after retreatment;
culture is the recommended test, preferably with simultaneous NAAT and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of _N gonorrhoeae_ if isolated.
Clinicians should ensure that the patient's sex partners from the preceding 60
days are evaluated promptly with culture and presumptively treated using the
same regimen used for the patient.

#### Gonococcal Conjunctivitis

In the only published study (conducted in 1989) of the treatment of gonococcal
conjunctivitis among adults, all 12 study participants responded to a single
1-g IM injection of ceftriaxone ( _580_ ). On the basis of experience with
other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance rapidly, a
theoretical basis exists for combination therapy using two antimicrobials with
different mechanisms of action (e.g., a cephalosporin plus azithromycin) to
improve treatment efficacy and potentially slow the emergence and spread of
resistance to cephalosporins. Because gonococcal conjunctivitis is uncommon
and data on treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis in adults are limited,

##### Management of Sex Partners

Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for evaluation and
treatment. For more information, see Gonococcal Infections, Management of Sex
Partners.

####  Disseminated Gonococcal Infection

Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) frequently results in petechial or
pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetric polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, or
oligoarticular septic arthritis ( _581_ ). The infection is complicated
occasionally by perihepatitis and rarely by endocarditis or meningitis. Some
strains of _N. gonorrhoeae_ that cause DGI can cause minimal genital
inflammation. If DGI is suspected, NAAT or culture specimens from urogenital
and extragenital sites, as applicable, should be collected and processed in
addition to specimens from disseminated sites of infection (e.g., skin,
synovial fluid, blood, and the CNS). All _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates should be
tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.

Hospitalization and consultation with an infectious-disease specialist are
recommended for initial therapy, especially for persons who might not comply
with treatment, have an uncertain diagnosis, or have purulent synovial
effusions or other complications. Examination for clinical evidence of
endocarditis and meningitis should be performed.

No recent studies have been published on the treatment of DGI. The duration of
treatment of DGI has not been systematically studied and should be determined
in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist. Treatment for DGI
should be guided by the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Pending antimicrobial susceptibility results, treatment decisions should be
made on the basis of clinical presentation. Therapy for meningitis should be
continued with recommended parenteral therapy for 10-14 days. Parenteral
antimicrobial therapy for endocarditis should be administered for at least 4
weeks.

##### Management of Sex Partners

Gonococcal infection frequently is asymptomatic in sex partners of persons who
have DGI. Providers should instruct patients to refer partners with whom they
have had sexual contact in the past 60 days for evaluation, testing, and
presumptive treatment (see Gonococcal Infection, Management of Sex Partners).

###  Gonococcal Infections Among Neonates

Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women is the best method for
preventing GC infection among neonates. Gonococcal infection among neonates
results from perinatal exposure to the mother's infected cervix. It is usually
an acute illness that manifests 2-5 days after birth. The prevalence of
infection among infants depends on the prevalence of infection among pregnant
women, whether pregnant women are screened and treated for gonorrhea, and
whether newborns receive ophthalmia prophylaxis. The most severe
manifestations of _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection in newborns are ophthalmia
neonatorum and sepsis, which can include arthritis and meningitis. Less severe
manifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, and infection at sites
of fetal monitoring.

####  Ophthalmia Neonatorum Prophylaxis

To prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, a prophylactic agent should be
instilled into both eyes of all newborn infants; this procedure is required by
law in most states. Ocular prophylaxis is warranted because it can prevent
sight-threatening gonococcal ophthalmia, has an excellent safety record, is
easy to administer, and is inexpensive. The recommended prophylactic regimen
prevents gonococcal ophthalmia; however, its efficacy for prevention of
chlamydial ophthalmia is less clear, and it does not eliminate nasopharyngeal
colonization by _C. trachomatis_.

##### _Recommended Regimen_

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Erythromycin** (0.5%) ophthalmic ointment in each eye in a single application at birth

This preparation should be instilled into both eyes of all neonates as soon as
possible after delivery, regardless of whether they are delivered vaginally or
by cesarean section. Ideally, ointment should be applied using single-use
tubes or ampules rather than multiple-use tubes. If prophylaxis is delayed
(i.e., not administered in the delivery room), a monitoring system should be
established to ensure that all infants receive prophylaxis.

Erythromycin is the only antibiotic ointment recommended for use in neonates.
Silver nitrate and tetracycline ophthalmic ointment is no longer manufactured
in the United States, bacitracin is not effective, and povidone iodine has not
been studied adequately ( _582,583_ ). Gentamicin ophthalmic ointment has been
associated with severe ocular reactions in neonates and should not be used for
ocular prophylaxis ( _584,585_ ). If erythromycin ointment is not available,
infants at risk for exposure to _N. gonorrhoeae_ (especially those born to a
mother at risk for gonococcal infection or with no prenatal care) can be
administered ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM, not to exceed 125 mg in a
single dose ( _586_ ).

_N. gonorrhoeae_ causes ophthalmia neonatorum relatively infrequently in the
United States ( _587_ ). However, identifying and treating this infection is
especially important, because ophthalmia neonatorum can result in perforation
of the globe of the eye and blindness ( _588_ ).

#### Diagnostic Considerations

Infants at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia include those who did not
receive ophthalmia prophylaxis and whose mothers had no prenatal care or have
a history of STDs or substance abuse. Gonococcal ophthalmia is strongly
suspected when intracellular gram-negative diplococci are identified on Gram
stain of conjunctival exudate, justifying presumptive treatment for gonorrhea
after appropriate cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for _N.
gonorrhoeae_ are performed. Presumptive treatment for _N. gonorrhoeae_ might
be indicated for newborns at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia who have
increased WBCs (but not intracellular gram negative diplococci) in a Gram-
stained smear of conjunctival exudate. Nongonococcal causes of neonatal
ophthalmia include _Moraxella catarrhalis_ and other Neisseria species,
organisms that are indistinguishable from _N. gonorrhoeae_ on Gram-stained
smear but can be differentiated in the microbiology laboratory.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Ceftriaxone** 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 125 mg

One dose of ceftriaxone is adequate therapy for gonococcal conjunctivitis.
Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to hyperbilirubinemic infants,
especially those born prematurely. No data exist on the use of dual therapy
for the treatment of gonococcal ophthalmia. Topical antibiotic therapy alone
is inadequate and unnecessary if systemic treatment is administered.

#### Other Management Considerations

Appropriate chlamydial testing should be done simultaneously from the inverted
eyelid specimen (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by _C. trachomatis_ ).
Infants who have gonococcal ophthalmia should be evaluated for signs of
disseminated infection (e.g., sepsis, arthritis, and meningitis). Infants who
have gonococcal ophthalmia should be managed in consultation with an
infectious-disease specialist.

#### Follow-up

Infants who have ophthalmia neonatorum should be managed in consultation with
an infectious-disease specialist.

#### Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners

Mothers of infants with ophthalmia neonatorum caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_
should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea, along
with their sex partner(s). For more information, see Gonococcal Infections in
Adolescents and Adults.

#### DGI and Gonococcal Scalp Abscesses in Neonates

DGI might present as sepsis, arthritis, or meningitis and is a rare
complication of neonatal gonococcal infection. Localized gonococcal infection
of the scalp can result from fetal monitoring through scalp electrodes.
Detection of gonococcal infection in neonates who have sepsis, arthritis,
meningitis, or scalp abscesses requires cultures of blood, CSF, and joint
aspirate. Specimens obtained from the conjunctiva, vagina, oropharynx, and
rectum are useful for identifying the primary site(s) of infection.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates should be performed.
Positive Gram-stained smears of exudate, CSF, or joint aspirate provide a
presumptive basis for initiating treatment for _N. gonorrhoeae_.

Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to hyperbilirubinemic infants,
especially those born prematurely. No data exist on the use of dual therapy
for the treatment of DGI or gonococcal scalp abscesses.

#### Other Management Considerations

Appropriate chlamydial testing should be done simultaneously in neonates with
gonococcal infection. For more information, see Chlamydia Infection in
Neonates. Infants who have DGI should be managed in consultation with an
infectious-disease specialist.

#### Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners

Mothers of infants who have DGI or scalp abscesses caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_
should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea, along
with their sex partner(s). For more information, see Gonococcal Infections in
Adolescents and Adults.

#### Neonates Born to Mothers Who Have Gonococcal Infection

Neonates born to mothers who have untreated gonorrhea are at high risk for
infection. Neonates should be tested for gonorrhea at exposed sites and
treated presumptively for gonorrhea as recommended in these guidelines. No
data exist on the use of dual therapy to treat neonates born to mothers who
have gonococcal infection.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * **Ceftriaxone** 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 125 mg

##### Other Management Considerations

Appropriate chlamydial testing should be done simultaneously in neonates with
gonococcal infection. For more information, see Chlamydia Infection in
Neonates. Follow-up examination is not required.

##### Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners

Mothers who have gonorrhea and their sex partners should be evaluated, tested,
and presumptively treated for gonorrhea. For more information, see Gonococcal
Infections.

###  Gonococcal Infections Among Infants and Children

Sexual abuse is the most frequent cause of gonococcal infection in infants and
children (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). For preadolescent girls,
vaginitis is the most common manifestation of this infection; gonococcal-
associated PID after vaginal infection can be less common in preadolescents
than adults. Among sexually abused children, anorectal and pharyngeal
infections with _N. gonorrhoeae_ are frequently asymptomatic.

#### Diagnostic Considerations

NAAT can be used to test vaginal and urine specimens from girls (see Sexual
Assault or Abuse of Children), although data are insufficient to recommend the
use of these tests in boys and from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) in
boys and girls ( _394_ ). Culture remains the preferred method for diagnosing
boys and for detecting infection in specimens obtained from extragenital sites
regardless of gender ( _394_ ). Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating
prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or
exclude gonorrhea. If evidence of disseminated gonococcal infection exists,
gonorrhea culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be obtained
from relevant clinical sites (see DGI).

No data exist regarding the use of dual therapy for treating children with
gonococcal infection.

#### Other Management Considerations

Follow-up cultures are unnecessary. Only parenteral cephalosporins (i.e.,
ceftriaxone) are recommended for use in children. All children found to have
gonococcal infections should be tested for _C. trachomatis_ , syphilis, and
HIV. For a discussion of concerns regarding sexual assault, see Sexual Assault
or Abuse of Children.
