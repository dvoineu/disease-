# Behavior Therapy First for Young Children with ADHD

**Did you know that many children with severe symptoms of ADHD are diagnosed
before 6 years of age? Young children with ADHD need the right treatment for
ADHD. Learn about using behavior therapy first to help young children with
ADHD.**

ADHD is one of the most common enduring conditions of childhood and affects
many children, including very young children. Those with more severe symptoms
are often diagnosed earlier. Read about trends in diagnosis and medication
treatment for ADHD.

Being easily distracted, impulsive, and highly active is normal for young
children, but when the symptoms are severe and persistent, it can cause
problems. Young children with ADHD are more likely than those without ADHD to
have difficulties in daycare or school, including problems with peer
relationships, learning, and a higher risk of injuries.

### My Young Child has been Diagnosed with ADHD, Now What?

For older children, the best treatment is often a combination of behavior
therapy and medication. But for children under 6 years of age, experts
recommend that ADHD be treated with behavior therapy first, before trying
medication. Behavior therapy is the recommended treatment for ADHD in children
under 6. The type of behavior therapy that is most effective for this age is
**parent training in behavior management** , meaning that therapists work with
parents and teach them the skills needed to help their child better manage
their ADHD.

### How Can Parent Training in Behavior Management Help my Child?

Children who have ADHD act in ways that are often challenging for parents.
Children may forget things they are told, be overly active, and act before
thinking. They might not be able to get positive attention the way that other
children can; they tend to misbehave and might be punished more frequently
than other children. Even if children with ADHD really try to follow rules,
they might not be able to. This can have a negative impact on their self-
image, and cause them to give up trying or to act up more often.

A therapist skilled in behavior management can help parents understand how
ADHD affects their child. Parent training in behavior management is used to
help change problem behaviors by building parenting skills, improving the
relationship between parents and their child with ADHD, and helping children
manage their own behaviors.

Others (daycare providers, preschool teachers, and other caretakers) can also
help to manage the behavior of preschoolers who have ADHD by becoming educated
about the disorder and by being trained in behavioral techniques.

### The Recommended First Choice

Behavior therapy is the recommended ADHD treatment for children under 6 and
should be used first, before medications that treat ADHD.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Children under 6 are more likely than older children to experience side effects from ADHD medications, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, and a loss of energy.

Studies have shown that families who receive ** ** training in behavior therapy notice improvements for several years after treatment.

Parent training in behavior management has evidence as an effective treatment.
There are several programs that meet the criteria of the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality for effective treatments. Read more about these behavior
therapy training programs for parents of young children here.
