## Summary

When you're short of breath, it's hard or uncomfortable for you to take in the
oxygen your body needs. You may feel as if you're not getting enough air.
Sometimes you can have mild breathing problems because of a stuffy nose or
intense exercise. But shortness of breath can also be a sign of a serious
disease.

Many conditions can make you feel short of breath:

  * Lung conditions such as asthma, emphysema, or pneumonia
  * Problems with your trachea or bronchi, which are part of your airway system
  * Heart disease can make you feel breathless if your heart cannot pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body
  * Anxiety and panic attacks
  * Allergies

If you often have trouble breathing, it is important to find out the cause.
