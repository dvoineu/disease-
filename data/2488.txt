A candidate vaccine virus (CVV) is an influenza (flu) virus that has been
prepared by CDC or another public health partner that can be used by vaccine
manufacturers to produce a flu vaccine. In addition to preparing CVVs for
seasonal flu vaccine production, CDC routinely develops CVVs for novel avian
influenza (bird flu) viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic
preparedness activities. Some novel bird flu viruses with pandemic potential
are "highly pathogenic avian influenza" (HPAI) viruses, which means they are
deadly to domestic poultry, including chickens. Data collected through global
and animal flu surveillance informs the selection of CVVs, and experts choose
CVVs against bird flu viruses in nature ("wild type" viruses) that pose a risk
to human health.

The creation of a CVV for a novel bird flu virus is a multistep process that
takes months, from start to finish. Creating a bird flu CVV is usually more
complicated than the process for creating a seasonal flu CVV. There are five
steps involved in the creation of a bird flu CVV, including the following:

###  Production of the candidate vaccine virus (CVV)

Flu vaccines protect against specific flu viruses, so the first step in
creating a CVV against a particular bird flu virus is to identify the wild
type bird flu virus that is posing or may pose a risk to human health.

Two qualities are required of a CVV: First, the CVV must be capable of
stimulating a protective immune response against that wild type bird flu
virus. Second, the CVV must grow well in eggs. Most flu vaccines today are
produced using egg-based technology, which requires that the CVVs be grown in
chicken eggs so the CVV needs to grow well in chicken eggs. (For more
information about how vaccines are made, see "How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are
Made.") Highly pathogenic bird flu viruses cause severe illness and death in
birds and destroy chicken eggs, and are therefore very difficult to grow in
eggs. In addition, HPAI viruses cause severe illness and death in animal
models of human disease. Therefore, the wild type virus found in nature cannot
be used to make the CVV because they won't grow in eggs and might be dangerous
to people. Scientists at CDC use "reverse genetics" to create an attenuated
(i.e., weakened or milder) form of the bird flu virus that will not cause
severe illness in birds (so as to not pose a threat to agricultural interests)
and that also will grow well in chicken eggs (so that vaccine manufacturers
can use it to produce vaccine).

Using reverse genetics, CDC scientists take two genes from the bird flu virus
-- the neuraminidase (NA) and a modified form of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene
-- and they combine those two genes with six genes of a commonly used human
flu virus that grows well in chicken eggs. The HA and NA from the bird flu
virus are either prepared synthetically or by using the viral RNA of the wild
type virus, if it is available. The HA is modified by removing the site that
is responsible for making the virus deadly to birds and chicken eggs, called
the "polybasic cleavage site." The prepared DNA is introduced into cells
(typically "Vero" cells in the laboratory) and allowed to grow for three days.
Then it is collected from the cells and injected into eggs to grow virus
stocks. The virus stocks undergo testing to determine if a sufficient amount
of virus is present in the eggs, and the CVV is analyzed to determine if it is
suitable for vaccine development in terms of compliance with regulatory
requirements.

A CVV must be made according to FDA "good laboratory practice" (GLP)
regulations for biologics for human use. GLP is a quality system concerned
with the organizational process and the conditions under which vaccine
development is planned, performed, monitored, recorded, archived and reported
per FDA guidelines.

Ideally, the attenuated virus resulting at the end of this process is a virus
that is antigenically "like" the wild-type bird flu virus. This virus should
stimulate the desired immune response and grow well in chicken eggs.

###  Quality Assessment

Once the CVV has been created using reverse genetics and grown in eggs (i.e.,
rescued), the CVV undergoes a number of tests as part of quality assessment.
These steps are listed and described below.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Gene Sequence Verification**  
Flu experts verify that the CVV produced is genetically stable and hasn't
undergone any unintended changes or mutations. PCR and full genome sequencing
are used to ensure the CVV is as close as possible to the wild type bird flu
virus it is intended to protect against.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Impurity Testing**  
Flu experts check to make sure that the CVV does not contain bacteria or
fungi.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Exclusivity Testing**  
The CVV is tested to ensure that it only contains the virus intended and is
not mixed with other viruses.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Trypsin Dependent Plaque Assay Testing**  
The "trypsin dependent plaque assay" is a laboratory test that ensures that
the polybasic cleavage site (i.e., the part of the virus that makes the virus
deadly in poultry and chicken eggs) has been removed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Embryo Lethality Testing**  
This test confirms that the CVV does not kill chicken embryos. This is a
required for egg-based vaccine production.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Antigenic Characterization**  
CDC uses the hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test to antigenically characterize
the CVV to ensure that the CVV is antigenically similar to the bird flu virus
in nature that the CVV is intended to protect against. Antigenic similarity in
this instance means antibodies produced in response to the CVV also will
recognize and target the corresponding wild-type bird flu virus.

###  Determination of Attenuation

Following quality assurance tests, the CVV goes through a series of animal
tests intended to confirm that the resulting virus stock is attenuated (i.e.,
made milder or weakened). Determination of attenuation requires testing in
chickens and ferrets. Specific steps are described below:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Pathogenicity Testing in Chickens**  
Chickens are inoculated with the CVV and observed to make sure they don't get
sick or die. This testing verifies that the CVV is not highly pathogenic in
domestic poultry. This means the CVV will not harm agricultural interests and
can be safely used during egg-based production. Pathogenicity testing in
chickens is done by an outside collaborator, such as the United States
Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Southeastern Poultry Research Laboratory
(SEPRL). The results of this testing are then shared with CDC.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Pathogenicity testing in ferrets**  
Ferrets also are inoculated with the CVV and observed to ensure the CVV does
not cause severe illness. Flu viruses infect and cause disease in ferrets in a
way that is similar to humans, and so ferrets often are used as a model to
infer flu disease and transmission characteristics in people.

This is the final step to ensure that the CVV has been properly attenuated and
is safe for birds and mammals.

###  Request for CVV Exclusion from the USDA Select Agents List

Next, a request is filed with the USDA to get the CVV excluded from the
"Select Agent" list. Certain biological agents or toxins that pose a potential
severe threat to public health and safety are designated as "Select Agents."
(For more information on select agents, see the Federal Select Agent Program
websiteExternal.) Highly pathogenic bird flu viruses are Select Agents, and so
a CVV made from one of these viruses is treated as a Select Agent until an
exclusion is granted by USDA. This is necessary before the CVV can be given to
flu vaccine manufacturers. To obtain USDA Select Agent exclusion, CDC prepares
and submits appropriate documentation to USDA, including all of the virus
attenuation verification data. USDA then reviews the application and decides
whether the CVV can be excluded as a Select Agent.

###  Distribution to Vaccine Manufacturers and Other Stakeholders

The final step is to ship the CVV. The CVV is shared with other World Health
Organization (WHO) Collaborating CentersExternal, Essential Regulatory
Laboratories (ERLs) and vaccine manufacturers.
