_Sappinia_ is a free-living ameba, or amoeba* (a single-celled living
organism), found in the environment. There are two known species of _Sappinia:
Sappinia diploidea_ and _Sappinia pedata_. This ameba causes amebic
encephalitis, which is an infection of the brain. Worldwide, only one case of
amebic encephalitis due to _Sappinia_ infection has been reported.
