## Summary

Like adults, kids need exercise. Most children need at least an hour of
physical activity every day. Regular exercise has many benefits for children.
It can help them

    * Feel less stressed
    * Feel better about themselves
    * Feel more ready to learn in school
    * Keep a healthy weight
    * Build and keep healthy bones, muscles and joints
    * Sleep better at night

As kids spend more time watching TV, they spend less time running and playing.
Parents should limit TV, video game and computer time. Parents can set a good
example by being active themselves. Exercising together can be fun for
everyone. Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to
school, dancing, bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get
exercise.
