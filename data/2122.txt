## Summary

People in rural areas face some different health issues than people who live
in towns and cities. Getting health care can be a problem when you live in a
remote area. You might not be able to get to a hospital quickly in an
emergency. You also might not want to travel long distances to get routine
checkups and screenings. Rural areas often have fewer doctors and dentists,
and certain specialists might not be available at all.

Because it can be hard to get care, health problems in rural residents may be
more serious by the time they are diagnosed. People in rural areas of the
United States have higher rates of chronic disease than people in urban areas.
They also have higher rates of certain types of cancer, from exposure to
chemicals used in farming.
