Epilepsy and Seizures

![Brain activity](/epilepsy/images/about/brain-activity.jpg)

Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain. People are diagnosed with epilepsy when
they have had two or more seizures.

There are many types of seizures. A person with epilepsy can have more than
one type of seizure.

**The signs of a seizure depend on the type of seizure.**

Sometimes it is hard to tell when a person is having a seizure. A person
having a seizure may seem confused or look like they are staring at something
that isn't there. Other seizures can cause a person to fall, shake, and become
unaware of what's going on around them.

Learn about different types of seizures and their signs and symptoms so you
can tell when someone is having a seizure.  
Visit our first aid page to learn what you can do to keep that person safe
until the seizure stops by itself.

Major Types of Seizures

 **Seizures are classified into two groups.**

These seizures are also called partial seizures.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Simple focal seizures** affect a small part of the brain. These seizures can cause twitching or a change in sensation, such as a strange taste or smell.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Complex focal seizures** can make a person with epilepsy confused or dazed. The person will be unable to respond to questions or direction for up to a few minutes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * **Secondary generalized seizures** begin in one part of the brain, but then spread to both sides of the brain. In other words, the person first has a focal seizure, followed by a generalized seizure.

Seizures may last as long as a few minutes.

Words that describe generalized seizures

These words are used to describe generalized seizures:

Call 911 if a Seizure Lasts More Than 5 Minutes

![Five minute clock](/epilepsy/images/about/5-min-clock.jpg)

**Not all seizures are  emergencies.**

Keep track of how long the seizure lasts. Call 911 if a seizure lasts more
than 5 minutes or if the person gets injured during the seizure.
