A port-wine stain is a birthmark in which swollen blood vessels create a
reddish-purplish discoloration of the skin.

## Causes

Port-wine stains are caused by an abnormal formation of tiny blood vessels in
the skin.

In rare cases, port-wine stainsÂ are a sign of Sturge-Weber syndrome or
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.

## Symptoms

Early-stage port-wine stains are usually flat and pink. As the child gets
older, the stain grows with the child and the color may deepen to dark red or
purple. Port-wine stains occur most often on the face, but can appear anywhere
on the body. Over time, the area can become thickened and take on a
cobblestone-like appearance.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider can usually diagnose a port-wine stain by looking at
the skin.

In a few cases, a skin biopsy is needed. Depending on the location of the
birthmark and other symptoms, the provider may want to do an intraocular
pressure test of the eye or x-ray of the skull.

An MRI or CT scan of the brain may also be done.

## Treatment

Many treatments have been tried for port-wine stains, including freezing,
surgery, radiation, and tattooing.

Laser therapyÂ is most successfulÂ inÂ removing port-wine stains. It is the
only method that can destroy the tiny blood vessels in the skin withoutÂ
causing muchÂ damage toÂ the skin. The exact type of laser used depends on the
person's age, skin type,Â and particular port-wine stain.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Stains on the face respond better to laser therapy than those on the arms,
legs, or middle of the body. Older stains may be more difficult to treat.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Deformity and increasing disfigurement
    * Emotional and social problems related to their appearance
    * Development of glaucomaÂ in people with port-wine stains involving upper and lower eyelids
    * Neurologic problems when port-wine stain is associated with a disorder such as Sturge-Weber syndrome

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

All birthmarks should be evaluated by the provider during a routine
examination.

## Alternative Names

Nevus flammeus
