Sydenham chorea is a movement disorder that occurs after infection with
certain bacteria called group A streptococcus.

## Causes

Sydenham chorea is caused by an infection with bacteria called group A
streptococcus. This is the bacteria that cause rheumatic fever (RF) and strep
throat. Group A streptococcus bacteria can react with a part of the brain
called basal ganglia to cause this disorder. The basal ganglia are a set of
structures deep in the brain. They help control movement, posture, and speech.

Sydenham chorea is a major sign of acute RF. The person may currently or
recently have had the disease. Sydenham chorea may be the only sign of RF in
some people.

Sydenham chorea occurs most often in girls before puberty, but may be seen in
boys.

## Symptoms

Sydenham chorea mainly involves jerky, uncontrollable and purposeless
movements of the hands, arms, shoulder, face, legs, and trunk. These movements
look like twitches, and disappear during sleep. Other symptoms may include:

    * Changes in handwriting
    * Loss of fine motor control, especially of the fingers and hands
    * Loss of emotional control, with bouts of inappropriate crying or laughing

Symptoms of RF may be present. These may include high fever, heart problem,
joint pain or swelling, skin lumps or skin rashes, and nosebleeds.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Detailed questions will
be asked about the symptoms.

If a streptococcus infection is suspected, tests will be done to confirm the
infection. These include:

    * Throat swab
    * Anti-DNAse B blood test
    * Antistreptolysin O (ASO) blood test

Further testing may include:

    * Blood tests such as ESR, CBC
    * MRI or CT scan of the brain

## Treatment

Antibiotics are used to kill the streptococcus bacteria. The provider may also
prescribe antibiotics to prevent future RF infections. This is called
preventive antibiotics, or antibiotic prophylaxis.

Severe movement or emotional symptoms may need to be treated with medicines.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Sydenham chorea usually clears up in a few months. In rare cases, an unusual
form of Sydenham chorea may begin later in life.

## Possible Complications

No complications are expected.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if your child develops uncontrollable or jerky movements,
especially if the child has recently had a sore throat.

## Prevention

Pay careful attention to children's complaints of sore throats and get early
treatment to prevent acute RF. If there is a strong family history of RF, be
especially watchful, because your children may be more likely to develop this
infection.

chorea; Strep throat - Sydenham chorea; Streptococcal - Sydenham chorea;
