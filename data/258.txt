## Summary

Every year, lives are lost because of the spread of infections in hospitals.
Health care workers can take steps to prevent the spread of infectious
diseases. These steps are part of infection control.

Proper hand washing is the most effective way to prevent the spread of
infections in hospitals. If you are a patient, don't be afraid to remind
friends, family and health care providers to wash their hands before getting
close to you.

Other steps health care workers can take include

  * Covering coughs and sneezes
  * Staying up-to-date with immunizations
  * Using gloves, masks and protective clothing
  * Making tissues and hand cleaners available 
  * Following hospital guidelines when dealing with blood or contaminated items
