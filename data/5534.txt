The acid-fast stain is a laboratory test that determines if a sample of
tissue, blood, or other body substance is infected with the bacteria that
causes tuberculosis (TB) and other illnesses.

## How the Test is Performed

Your health care provider will collect a sample of urine, stool, sputum, bone
marrow, or tissue, depending on the location of the suspected infection.

The sample is then sent to a laboratory. Some of the sample is placed on a
glass slide, stained, and heated. The cells in the sample hold onto the dye.
The slide is then washed with an acid solution and a different stain is
applied.

Bacteria that hold onto the first dye are considered "acid-fast" because they
resist the acid wash. These types of bacteria are associated with TB and other
infections.

## How to Prepare for the Test

Preparation depends on how the sample is collected. Your provider will tell
you how to prepare.

## How the Test will Feel

The amount of discomfort depends on how the sample is collected. Your provider
will discuss this with you.

## Why the Test is Performed

The test can tell if you are likely infected with the bacteria that cause TB
and related infections.

## Normal Results

A normal result means no acid-fast bacteria were found on the stained sample.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs
use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor
about the meaning of your specific test result.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to:

    * TB
    * Leprosy
    * Nocardia infections (also caused by a bacteria) 

## Risks

Risks depend on how the sample is collected. Ask your provider to explain the
risks and benefits of the medical procedure.
