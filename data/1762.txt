## Summary

Oral cancer can form in any part of the mouth. Most oral cancers begin in the
flat cells that cover the surfaces of your mouth, tongue, and lips. Anyone can
get oral cancer, but the risk is higher if you are male, use tobacco, drink
lots of alcohol, have HPV, or have a history of head or neck cancer. Frequent
sun exposure is also a risk factor for lip cancer.

Symptoms of oral cancer include

    * White or red patches in your mouth
    * A mouth sore that won't heal
    * Bleeding in your mouth
    * Loose teeth
    * Problems or pain with swallowing
    * A lump in your neck
    * An earache

Tests to diagnose oral cancer include a physical exam, endoscopy, biopsy, and
imaging tests. Oral cancer treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy,
and chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments.
