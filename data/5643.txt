Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children -- United States, February 12-April 2,
2020  
CDC MMWR, April 6, 2020 ![Brand](/PHGKB/images/CDC_Info.jpg)

Among 345 pediatric cases, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition. The
most common underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (including asthma)
(40), cardiovascular disease (25), and immunosuppression (10). 77% of
hospitalized patients, including all six patients admitted to an ICU, had one
or more underlying medical condition.

Assessment of Specimen Pooling to Conserve SARS CoV-2 Testing Resources  
B Abdalhamid et al, MEDRXIV, April 6, 2020

Parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were: prevalence
rate of 5%, a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies per microliter,
sensitivity and specificity of 100%, two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range
of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples.

Google Searches Can Help Us Find Emerging Covid-19 Outbreaks  
NY Times, April 5, 2020

While there does seem to be important information about Covid-19 prevalence in
search data, we have to use great care in building models based on this data
and learn from past attempts that tried to use this data to measure the
geographic spread of different diseases.

Forecasting the dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic in Top 15 countries in April
2020: ARIMA Model with Machine Learning Approach  
P Kumar e al, MEDRXIV, April 5, 2020

Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 infection  
L Wynants, MEDRXIV, April 5, 2020

Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included
age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase,
and lymphocyte count. Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models
ranged from 0.73 to 0.81. All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly
because of non-representative selection of control patients.

The mystery of why the coronavirus kills some young people  
S Gupta, CNN, April 6, 2020

So, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer
could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what
differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die. One possibility
is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene. ACE2 is an enzyme that attaches to the
outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart.

Quantifying the use of connected digital products in clinical research  
C Marra et al, NPJ Digital Medicine, April 2020

Using 18 years of data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we document substantial growth
in the use of connected digital products in clinical trials (~34% CAGR) and
show that these products have been used across all phases of research and by a
diverse group of trial sponsors.

Score **

Electronic health records and polygenic risk scores for predicting disease
risk  
R Li et al, Nat Rev Genetics, March 31, 2020

Increasingly, electronic health records (EHRs) are being linked to patient
genetic data in biobanks, which provides new opportunities for developing and
applying polygenic risk scores in the clinic, to systematically examine and
evaluate patient susceptibilities to disease. However, the heterogeneous
nature of EHR data brings forth many practical challenges.

Personalized predictions of patient outcomes during and after hospitalization
using artificial intelligence  
CB Hilton, et al. NPJ Digital Medicine, April 2020

Hospital systems, payers, and regulators have focused on reducing length of
stay (LOS) and early readmission, with uncertain benefit. Interpretable
machine learning (ML) may assist in transparently identifying the risk of
important outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of
hospitalizations at a tertiary academic medical center.

**Immunotherapy **

Moving towards personalized treatments of immune-related adverse events  
K Esfahani et al, Nat Rev Clin Oncology, April 3, 2020

We provide an overview of key cellular and soluble immunological factors
mediating immunotherapy related adverse effects, and propose a model
integrating this knowledge with the immunohistopathological findings of the
affected organs for a personalized decision-making process for each patient.
