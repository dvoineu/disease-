## Summary

Conjunctivitis is the medical name for pink eye. It involves inflammation of
the outer layer of the eye and inside of the eyelid. It can cause swelling,
itching, burning, discharge, and redness. Causes include

    * Bacterial or viral infection
    * Allergies 
    * Substances that cause irritation
    * Contact lens products, eye drops, or eye ointments

Pinkeye usually does not affect vision. Infectious pink eye can easily spread
from one person to another. The infection will clear in most cases without
medical care, but bacterial pinkeye needs treatment with antibiotic eye drops
or ointment.
