## Summary

Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder. The cause is long-term exposure to
too much cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal gland makes. Sometimes, taking
synthetic hormone medicine to treat an inflammatory disease leads to
Cushing's. Some kinds of tumors produce a hormone that can cause your body to
make too much cortisol.

Cushing's syndrome is rare. Some symptoms are

    * Upper body obesity 
    * Thin arms and legs
    * Severe fatigue and muscle weakness
    * High blood pressure
    * High blood sugar
    * Easy bruising

Lab tests can show if you have it and find the cause. Your treatment will
depend on why you have too much cortisol. If it is because you have been
taking synthetic hormones, a lower dose may control your symptoms. If the
cause is a tumor, surgery and other therapies may be needed.
