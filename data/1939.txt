Overview

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * CDC, FDA, and state health authorities have made progress in identifying the cause of EVALI.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Emergency department (ED) visits related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products continue to decline, after sharply increasing in August 2019 and peaking in September.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * National and state data from patient reports and product sample testing show tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers, are linked to most EVALI cases and play a major role in the outbreak.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Vitamin E acetate is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak. Vitamin E acetate has been found in product samples tested by FDA and state laboratories and in patient lung fluid samples tested by CDC from geographically diverse states. Vitamin E acetate has not been found in the lung fluid of people that do not have EVALI.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Evidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC or non-THC products, in some of the reported EVALI cases.

CDC will continue to update guidance related to EVALI as appropriate.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Vitamin E acetate was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples (fluid samples collected from the lungs) from 48 of the 51 EVALI patients, but not in the BAL fluid from the healthy comparison group.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * No other toxicants were found in BAL fluid from either group, except for coconut oil and limonene (1 EVALI patient each).

CDC will continue to provide assistance to states, as needed, related to EVALI and will provide any updates at: www.cdc.gov/lunginjury.

If they choose to use e-cigarettes as an alternative to cigarettes, they should completely switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes and not partake in an extended period of dual use of both products that delays quitting smoking completely. They should contact their healthcare professional if they need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, as well as if they have concerns about EVALI.
