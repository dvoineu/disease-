## Summary

How well you and your doctor communicate with each other is one of the most
important parts of getting good health care. Being prepared can help make the
most of your visit. Here are some things you can bring:

  * Lists of your concerns, any allergies and all the medicines, herbs, or vitamins you take
  * A description of symptoms - when they started, what makes them better 
  * A trusted friend or family member
  * A way to take notes during your appointment

Make sure you understand your diagnosis and any treatments. Ask your health
care provider to write down his or her instructions to you. If you still have
trouble understanding, ask where you can go for more information.
