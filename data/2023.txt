## Summary

Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures.
The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain
send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or
behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness.

Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and
abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown.

Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important
to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines
can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well,
surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special
diets can help some children with epilepsy.
