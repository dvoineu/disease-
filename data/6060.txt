Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is an inherited disorder in which nerve tissue
tumors (neurofibromas) form in the:

      * Bottom layer of skin (subcutaneous tissue)
      * Nerves from the brain (cranial nerves) and spinal cord (spinal root nerves) 

## Causes

NF1 is an inherited disease. If either parent has NF1, each of their children
has a 50% chance of having the disease.

NF1 also appears in families with no history of the condition. In these cases,
it is caused by a new gene change (mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is
caused by problems with a gene for a protein called neurofibromin.

## Symptoms

NF causes tissue along the nerves to grow uncontrollably. This growth can put
pressure on affected nerves.

If the growths are in the skin, there can be cosmetic issues. If the growths
are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve
damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects. Problems with
feeling or movement can occur, depending on which nerves are affected.

The condition can be very different from person to person, even among people
in the same family who have the same NF1 gene change.

"Coffee-with-milk" (cafÃ©-au-lait) spots are the hallmark symptom of NF. Many
healthy people have one or two small cafÃ© au lait spots. However, adults who
have six or more spots that are bigger than 1.5 cm in diameter (0.5 cm in
children) could have NF. In some people with the condition, these spots may be
the only symptom.

Other symptoms may include:

      * Tumors of the eye, such as optic glioma
      * Seizures
      * Freckles in the underarm or groin
      * Large, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin
      * Pain (from affected nerves)
      * Small, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromasÂ 

## Exams and Tests

A health care provider who treats NF1 will diagnose this condition. The
provider may be a:

      * Dermatologist
      * Developmental pediatrician
      * Geneticist
      * Neurologist 

The diagnosis will most likely be made based on the unique symptoms and signs
of NF.

Signs include:

      * Colored, raised spots (Lisch nodules) on the colored part (iris) of the eye
      * Bowing of the lower leg in early childhood that may lead to fractures
      * Freckling in the armpits, groin, or underneath the breast in women
      * Large tumors under the skin (plexiform neurofibromas), which can affect the appearance and put pressure on nearby nerves or organs
      * Many soft tumors on the skin or deeper in the body
      * Mild cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disorders 

Tests may include:

      * Eye exam by an ophthalmologist familiar with NF1
      * Genetic tests to find a change (mutation) in the neurofibromin gene
      * MRI of the brain or other affected sites
      * Other tests for complications 

## Treatment

There is no specific treatment for NF. Tumors that cause pain or loss of
function may be removed. Tumors that have grown quickly should be removed
promptly as they may become cancerous (malignant). Experimental treatments for
severe tumors are under investigation.

Some children with learning disorders may need special schooling.

## Support Groups

For more information and resources, contact the Children's Tumor Foundation at
www.ctf.org.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

If there are no complications, the life expectancy of people with NF is almost
normal. With the right education, people with NF can live a normal life.

Although mental impairment is generally mild, NF1 is a known cause of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Learning disabilities are a common
problem.

Some people are treated differently because they have hundreds of tumors on
their skin.

People with NF have an increased chance of developing severe tumors. In rare
cases, these can shorten a person's lifespan.

## Possible Complications

Complications can include:

      * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      * Blindness caused by a tumor in an optic nerve (optic glioma)
      * Break in the leg bones that does not heal well
      * Cancerous tumors
      * Loss of function in nerves that a neurofibroma has put pressure on over the long term
      * High blood pressure due to pheochromocytoma or renal artery stenosis
      * Regrowth of NF tumors
      * Scoliosis, or curvature of the spine
      * Tumors of the face, skin, and other exposed areas

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if:

      * You notice coffee-with-milk colored spots on your child's skin or any other symptoms of this condition.
      * You have a family history of NF and are planning to have children, or you would like to have your child examined.

## Prevention

Genetic counseling is recommended for anyone with a family history of NF.

Annual checkup should be performed for:

      * Eyes
      * Skin
      * Back
      * Nervous system
      * Blood pressure monitoringÂ
