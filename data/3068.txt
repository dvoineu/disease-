Title:Update: Interim Guidance for Health Care Providers regarding the
Management Approach of Patients with Suspected E-cigarette, or Vaping, Product
Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI)

Date:Thursday, November 21, 2019

CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health
departments, and public health and clinical stakeholders continue to
investigate a national outbreak of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), or
vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).

EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test
or marker exists for its diagnosis, and evaluation should be guided by
clinical judgment. Because patients with EVALI can present with symptoms
similar to influenza or other respiratory infections (e.g., fever, cough,
headache, myalgias, or fatigue), it might be difficult to differentiate EVALI
from influenza or CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) on initial presentation,
and EVALI may cooccur with respiratory infections. A large number of patients
will be presenting to healthcare facilities with respiratory symptoms during
the winter season who may not meet criteria for hospital admission, and this
will be happening in the context of a national outbreak of EVALI.

During this COCA Call, U.S. health care providers will learn recommendations
for managing patients with suspected or known EVALI when respiratory
infections such as influenza are more prevalent in the community, as published
in _MMWR_ on November 19, 2019.
