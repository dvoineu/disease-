Microbiology laboratories commonly receive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood
specimens from patients with meningitis, pneumonia, or unexplained febrile
illness. Laboratories may also receive joint fluid, pleural fluid, or other
sterile site specimens from these patients. Presumptive identification of _N.
meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ can be made on the basis
of a cytological examination of the CSF, specific colony morphology on blood
and/or chocolate agar, staining properties on a Gram stain, or by detection of
specific antigens in the CSF by a latex agglutination test or using a rapid
diagnostic test (RDT). Methods for confirmatory identification of _N.
meningitidis, S. pneumoniae,_ and _H. influenzae_ are presented in the next
chapters of this laboratory manual (Chapters 7: Identification and
Characterization of _N. meningitidis_, 8: Identification and Characterization
of _S. pneumoniae_, and 9: Identification and Characterization of _H.
influenzae_).

Personnel who are at risk of routine exposure to aerosolized _N. meningitidis_
should strongly consider vaccination. Additional health and safety information
can be found in Chapter 4: Biosafety. While laboratory-acquired infections
with _S. pneumoniae_ or _H. influenzae_ are not as extensively reported, fatal
infections with these bacteria can occur, and vaccination against these
organisms may be recommended in some laboratories.

Because the primary purpose of this manual is to aid in the identification of
_N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ from clinical specimens
collected from suspected cases of bacterial meningitis, the methods described
here will not allow for identification of other isolates that may be of
clinical importance but are less likely encountered. Microbiologists should
refer to clinical microbiology manuals, such as the American Society for
Microbiology's _Manual of Clinical Microbiology_ , for procedures to identify
other bacteria.

Processing CSF specimensA note about centrifugation: g (1 x gravity) represents relative centrifugal force (RCF), but the recommended centrifugation speed is often listed in protocols as revolutions per minute (RPM). RCF is dependent on the length of the radius of the rotor, thus the same RPM may not generate the same g force in another centrifuge. Therefore, RCF should be used to describe the centrifuge speed. If only RPM is given, RCF can be calculated using this formula:RCF = 0.00001118 x r x RPM2  
r = radius of rotor in centimeters

Once the CSF arrives in the microbiology laboratory, the volume of CSF
available for analysis should be noted. If < 1 ml of CSF is available, it
should not be centrifuged; instead, the CSF should be plated directly onto a
blood agar plate (BAP) and onto a chocolate agar plate (CAP) and also used for
the Gram stain. If > 1 ml of CSF is available (i.e., if the specimen volume is
sufficient for centrifugation), it must be centrifuged at a force sufficient
to sediment the bacteria. Typically, centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10-15
minutes is sufficient to sediment bacteria.

After the specimen has been centrifuged, the supernatant should be drawn off
with a Pasteur pipette and reserved if antigen detection by latex
agglutination is planned. The sediment should be vigorously mixed (e.g., in a
closed tube using a vortex machine). Once it has been well-mixed, one or two
drops of sediment should be used to prepare the Gram stain and one drop should
be used to streak the primary culture media.

Cytological examination of the CSF  
Laboratory examination of the CSF is usually the first step to confirm the
presence of bacterial meningitis. Note that cytological examination should
precede centrifugation and heating of the CSF. Typical CSF abnormalities

Presumptive identification by Gram stain, latex agglutination, or rapid diagnostic test (RDT)In combination with a clinical picture and CSF examination consistent with bacterial meningitis, a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial meningitis caused by _N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , or _H. influenzae_ can be made after performing a Gram stain of the CSF sediment or by detection of specific antigens in the CSF by a latex agglutination test or using RDTs. Positive results for any of these tests can rapidly provide evidence of infection, even if cultures fail to grow.

The Gram stain is an empirical method for differentiating bacterial species
into two large groups based on the chemical and physical properties of their
cell walls. Gram-positive bacteria retain the primary stain while gram-
negative bacteria take the color of the counterstain. A Gram stain can also
serve to assess the quality of a clinical specimen. The CSF should be properly
centrifuged in order to obtain the sediment for the procedure. Proper smear
preparation using the CSF sediment should produce a monolayer of organisms
sufficiently dense for easy visualization but thin enough to reveal
morphological characteristics. Clean, new glass slides should be used.
Positive and negative quality control (QC) strains should be tested along with
the unknown specimens. In addition to known reference strains for _N.
meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ , other reference
strains that may be used include _Staphylococcus aureus_ for gram-positive
cocci and _Escherichia coli_ for gram-negative rods.

Several commercial kits are available for latex agglutination testing. General
recommendations and instructions for the detection of soluble bacterial
antigens (capsular polysaccharide) are provided below, but the manufacturer's
instructions included in the kit should be followed precisely when using these
tests. For best results, the supernatant of the centrifuged CSF specimen
should be tested as soon as possible. If immediate testing is not possible,
the CSF specimen can be refrigerated (between 2-8°C) for several hours, or
frozen at -20°C for longer periods. It is imperative that the kits be kept
refrigerated before use, but never frozen, especially in tropical climates as
the kits deteriorate at high temperatures which may make the test results
unreliable before the expiration date of the kit.

##### **Latex agglutination procedure for CSF**

Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the package insert for the specific
latex kit being used. General instructions are listed below:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1.

RDT for meningococcal meningitis  
RDTs have been developed for direct testing of CSF specimens without prior
heat or centrifugation (2). The test is based on the principle of vertical
flow immunochromatography in which gold particles and nitrocellulose membranes
are coated with monoclonal antibodies to capture soluble serogroup-specific
polysaccharide antigens in the CSF. The test consists of 2 duplex paper sticks
(also called dipsticks), which together enable identification of four
serogroups of _N. meningitidis_ (A, C, W135, and Y). RDT1 tests for serogroups
A and W135/Y and RDT2 tests for serogroups C and Y.RDTs can be produced in
large quantities, are relatively inexpensive, and remain stable for weeks in
hot weather if protected from humidity; therefore, they are practical for
immediate testing of specimens obtained during adverse conditions. Initial
evaluation using RDTs on stored CSF from patients in Niger showed correct
identification of the meningococcal serogroup 97% of the time (4). However,
more recent studies under field conditions have shown similar specificity, but
much lower sensitivity of 70% (6) and, in contrast, similar sensitivity but
much lower specificity (5).

Selection of primary culture media  
The best medium for growth of _S. pneumoniae_ is a blood agar plate (BAP),
which is a trypticase soy agar (TSA) plate containing 5% sheep blood. Human
blood is NOT an acceptable substitute for the blood in the agar because the
antibodies contained in human blood may inhibit bacterial growth. _S.
pneumoniae_ will also grow on a chocolate agar plate (CAP).For _H. influenzae_
, a CAP made with heat lysed blood or supplemented with hemin (X factor) and
nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD; V factor) should be used. Growth of
_H. influenzae_ on a BAP may be achieved by adding a source of NAD,
traditionally done by cross-streaking the inoculated medium with a
_Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Enterococcus_ species strain. _H. influenzae_
forms satellite colonies along the length of the staphylococcal or
enterococcal growth. Additionally, applying filter paper (or disks) saturated
with hemin and NAD to the surface of the BAP after the medium has been
inoculated will produce a halo of growth around the strip or disk. _N.
meningitidis_ grows on both BAP and CAP. Because _N. meningitidis_ grows well
in a humid atmosphere, if an infection with _N. meningitidis_ is suspected,
laboratorians may choose to add a shallow pan of water to the bottom of the
incubator or add a dampened paper towel to the candle jar. The moisture source
should be changed regularly to prevent contamination with molds.

Ordinarily, both BAP and CAP are used for subculture. If only one type of
plate is available, a CAP should be used because it contains the hemin and NAD
needed for _H. influenzae,_ whereas a BAP does not.

If primary cultures appear to be contaminated, selective media may improve the
isolation of these bacteria from specimens containing a mixed flora of
bacteria and/or fungi. For primary isolation of _N. meningitidis_ , a
chocolate agar base containing vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and
trimethoprim can be used. For isolation of _S. pneumoniae_ , tryptic soy agar
with 5% sheep blood and either gentamicin, neomycin or sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (SXT) may be useful. For isolation of _H. influenzae_ , chocolate
agar with bacitracin can be used. Other antibiotic formulations are also
available.

QC of primary culture media  
All primary culture media should be tested for QC to ensure that the media
will support the proper growth of _N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae_ , and _H.
influenzae_. One plate from each new lot of media received should be tested
using an appropriate, well-characterized reference strain of _N. meningitidis,
S. pneumoniae_ , and/or _H. influenzae._ In addition, all media should be
tested periodically (every 3 months) to ensure that it can support the growth
of appropriate bacteria. One uninoculated plate from each new lot should also
be tested in order to check for contamination of mold or other organisms in
the laboratory and/or incubator. QC should be repeated on plates from a lot if
they have been exposed to temperatures above 4°C or if there is reason to
suspect that the plates have been contaminated since the initial QC was
performed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Primary culture from Trans-Isolate (T-I) medium

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. If the CSF cannot be transported to a microbiology laboratory immediately (within 1 hour from the time of collection) for culture and analysis, a bottle of T-I medium should be inoculated (1). To do this remove the aluminum cap with forceps, wipe the rubber stopper with a 70% alcohol swab (do not use povidone-iodine) and use a syringe to aseptically inoculate 0.5-1.0 ml of the CSF into the T-I medium for transport and growth of bacteria. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. If the T-I medium cannot be transported to a microbiology laboratory the same day of inoculation, insert a venting needle (sterile cotton-plugged hypodermic needle) through the rubber stopper of the T-I bottle, which will encourage growth and survival of the bacteria.

Incubate the inoculated T-I medium at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar) overnight or until transport is possible. If transportation is delayed more the 4 days, remove the vented T-I bottle from the incubator or candle jar and place it at room temperature (25°C) until shipment.

Once the T-I medium arrives in the microbiological laboratory, it can be cultured immediately.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2. If the T-I medium can be transported to a microbiology laboratory the same day of inoculation, do not vent the T-I bottle until it arrives in the receiving laboratory. Upon arrival, wipe the rubber stopper with 70% alcohol, insert a venting needle into the T-I bottle, incubate at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar), and observe daily for turbidity in the liquid phase for up to 7 days.

Isolates should always be inspected for purity of growth by looking at colony morphology before any testing is performed. If any contamination is seen, cultures should be re-streaked to ensure purity prior to testing.

Primary culture from a blood culture bottle  
The blood culture bottle should be immediately inoculated (within 1 minute)
after venipuncture to prevent the blood from clotting in the syringe. The
inoculated blood culture bottle should be transported to a microbiology
laboratory as soon as possible for incubation and subculture.

If transport to a microbiology laboratory is not possible the same day, place the blood culture bottle in an incubator at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar) until transport is possible. Inoculated blood culture bottles should not be placed in the refrigerator.

Examine the blood culture bottle for turbidity at 14-17 hours and then every day for up to 7 days. Any turbidity or lysis of erythrocytes may be indicative of growth, and subcultures onto primary culture media should be made immediately.

Once pure bacterial growth has been confirmed by subculture from the blood culture bottle, the bottle should be disposed of according to proper safety procedures.

MacConkey agar mediaIf the microbiology laboratory has the resources to support the use of a third plate for subculture, MacConkey agar should be used, particularly if the specimen was obtained from a patient with fever of unknown origin, when typhoid fever ( _S. typhi_ ) is suspected symptomatically, or if a Gram stain of blood culture broth reveals gram-negative bacilli. MacConkey agar is designed to grow gram-negative bacteria and stain them for lactose fermentation, in order to distinguish those that can ferment the sugar lactose (Lac+) from those that cannot (Lac-). It contains bile salts (to inhibit most gram-positive bacteria, except _Enterococcus_ and some species of _Staphylococcus_ , i.e., _Staphylococcus aureus_ ), crystal violet dye (which also inhibits certain gram-positive bacteria), neutral red dye, (which stains microbes fermenting lactose), lactose, and peptone.

Figure 11. Growth of _N. meningitidis_ on lower left, _S. pneumoniae_ on top,
and _H. influenzae_ on lower right of a CAP

_H. influenzae_ appear as large, colorless-to-grey, opaque colonies on a CAP
(Figure 12). No hemolysis or discoloration of the medium is apparent.
Encapsulated strains appear more mucoidal than non-encapsulated strains, which
appear as smaller compact grey colonies. _H. influenzae_ cannot grow on a BAP.

![Figure 12 is a picture showing H. influenzae colonies on a chocolate agar
plate \(CAP\).](/meningitis/lab-manual/images/chapt6-figure12.jpg)

Figure 12. _H. influenzae_ colonies on a CAP

Young colonies of _N. meningitidis_ are round, smooth, moist, glistening, and
convex, with a clearly defined edge on a BAP (Figure 13). Some colonies appear
to coalesce with other nearby colonies. Actively growing colonies of _N.
meningitidis_ on a BAP are grey and unpigmented. Older cultures (> 24 hours)
become more opaquely grey and sometimes cause the underlying agar to turn
dark. On a CAP, _N. meningitidis_ appear similar to _H. influenzae_ (see
description above). While _H. influenzae_ produce a pungent indol smell that
can differentiate it from _N. meningitidis,_ plates should not be opened in
order to smell the cultures.

\(BAP\).](/meningitis/lab-manual/images/chapt6-figure13.jpg)

Figure 13. _N. meningitidis_ colonies on a BAP

_S. pneumoniae_ appear as small, grey, moist (sometimes mucoidal), watery
colonies with a surrounding green zone of alpha-hemolysis on a BAP (Figure 14)
and CAP. The degree of mucoidness of _S. pneumoniae_ colonies is strain and
serotype dependent and is also influenced by the freshness of the medium and
the incubation atmosphere. Some serotypes appear more mucoidal than others;
the fresher the medium, the more mucoidal the cultures appear. Young
pneumococcal colonies appear raised, similar to viridans streptococci.
Differentiating pneumococci from viridans streptococci on a CAP is difficult.
However, once the pneumococcal culture ages 24-48 hours, the colonies become
flattened, and the central portion becomes depressed, which does not occur
with viridans streptococci (Figure 15). A microscope (30X-50X) or a 3X hand
lens can also be a useful tool in differentiating pneumococci from alpha-
hemolytic viridans streptococci.

after 24-48 hours of growth on a BAP, whereas the viridans streptococci retain

Other organisms that might appear on the culture plate along with _S.
pneumoniae_ are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ , or
another _Staphylococcus_ species. Figure 16 shows the two different types of
colonies growing on a BAP. The dull gray flat colony surrounded by a green
zone of hemolysis is _S. pneumoniae_ and the white colony with no hemolytic
activity is _S. epidermidis._

![Figure 16 is a picture showing the small grey, flat colonies surrounded by a
greenish zone of alpha-hemolysis are S. pneumoniae and the white colonies with
no hemolytic action are S. aureus.](/meningitis/lab-
