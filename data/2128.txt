## Summary

Any part of your neck - muscles, bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, or nerves
- can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from
your shoulder, jaw, head, or upper arms.

Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually
overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long. Sometimes you can
strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it
during exercise. Falls or accidents, including car accidents, are another
common cause of neck pain. Whiplash, a soft tissue injury to the neck, is also
called neck sprain or strain.

Treatment depends on the cause, but may include applying ice, taking pain
relievers, getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely
need surgery.
