## Summary

A brain aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery
in the brain. They are sometimes called berry aneurysms because they are often
the size of a small berry. Most brain aneurysms produce no symptoms until they
become large, begin to leak blood, or burst.

If a brain aneurysm presses on nerves in your brain, it can cause signs and
symptoms. These can include

  * A droopy eyelid 
  * Double vision or other changes in vision 
  * Pain above or behind the eye 
  * A dilated pupil 
  * Numbness or weakness on one side of the face or body 

Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, whether it is
infected, and whether it has burst. If a brain aneurysm bursts, symptoms can
include a sudden, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, loss of
consciousness, and signs of a stroke. Any of these symptoms requires immediate
medical attention.
