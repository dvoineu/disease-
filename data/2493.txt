### What are zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern?

Flu viruses of public health concern include the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Novel (i.e., non-human) flu viruses of zoonotic (animal origin) that have caused past human infections. For example, Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)* A(H5N1) or Asian lineage A(H7N9) viruses are zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern because they have infected people and caused serious illness.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Zoonotic origin flu viruses that have **not** caused past human infection(s) but that may have the potential to cause human infections. For example, the HPAI A(H5) viruses identified in the United States in 2015 have not caused human infections but remain flu viruses of public health concern because of their potential to cause human illness.

A common characteristic of all zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern
is that most people do not have pre-existing antibodies or immune protection
against them.

*Avian influenza A viruses are designated as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) based on molecular characteristics of the virus and the ability of the virus to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting.

### Why does CDC conduct research on zoonotic flu viruses of public health
concern?

CDC conducts research on flu viruses of public health concern because most
humans do not have any pre-existing immunity against them, and should these
viruses gain the ability to spread efficiently among humans, they could cause
a global outbreak of disease, i.e., a pandemic.

Flu viruses constantly change (see antigenic drift and shift, and sometimes
these changes result in the emergence of a novel flu virus that can easily
infect and spread between people. CDC Influenza Division is a World Health
Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Influenza. In this role, CDC
conducts surveillance of seasonal flu viruses circulating in people to make
informed decisions on the selection of viruses for use in creating seasonal
flu vaccines. As part of CDC's role as a WHO Collaborating Centre for
Influenza,  CDC also receives zoonotic viruses of public health concern that
CDC characterizes and uses to create candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) that can
be used to produce vaccines against viruses with pandemic potential. CDC also
conducts research on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern to learn
more about these viruses. For example, CDC studies where these viruses spread,
how they spread, who gets infections, and what kinds of illness they cause.
This information can help scientists better understand the risk these viruses
pose to humans and support development of tools and strategies for prevention
and treatment.

The two flu viruses of public health concern that have caused the most human
infections are both bird flu viruses: "Asian lineage avian influenza (HPAI)
A(H5N1 _)_ and Asian lineage A(H7N9) viruses. These two viruses have caused
severe illness and death in humans.

### What research does CDC conduct on zoonotic flu viruses of public health
concern?

CDC conducts laboratory tests on zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern
including, but not limited to the following: antigenic characterization,
antiviral resistance, genetic characterization, serology and assessment of flu
viruses' ability to cause disease and spread in animal models. See below for a
more detailed explanation of each of these laboratory tests.

#### Genetic Characterization

Genetic characterization as it applies to flu research is the study of the
genes of a flu virus using a laboratory process known as "genome sequencing."
Through genome sequencing researchers can determine the order of the amino
acids that form the proteins of a flu virus. Comparing the order of amino
acids in one sequence to other sequences can reveal variations that might
impact characteristics of the flu virus. For example, the composition of these
amino acids can affect factors such as how well a virus replicates during
infection, how well it transmits between hosts, its similarity or "match" to
current available vaccines, and susceptibility to vaccines and its
susceptibility to treatment with antiviral drugs. Flu researchers use genetic
characterization to better understand these markers and to assess the risk
these viruses pose to public health. Nearly all flu virus samples submitted to
CDC undergo genetic sequencing as a first step in the process of studying the
virus.

#### Antigenic Characterization

"Antigenic characterization" is the analysis of a flu virus' surface features
using antibodies. CDC researchers determine a flu virus' antigenic (immune)
properties to help assess how related different flu viruses are to each other.
CDC flu laboratorians conduct antigenic characterization as part of global flu
surveillance efforts to measure possible changes in circulating zoonotic flu
viruses, such as bird flu viruses. If antigenic characterization shows that
stockpiled vaccines no longer offer protection against newer viruses of public
health concern, then health officials can decide to develop new vaccines. In
some circumstances, CDC prepares candidate vaccine viruses in advance that
vaccine manufacturers can use to produce a flu vaccine in the future, should
it be needed. The main test used to conduct antigenic characterization is the
hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI test). CDC primarily conducts antigenic
characterization on bird flu H5, H7, and H9 viruses, but may test other types
of flu viruses that pose a potential risk to humans. More information on
antigenic characterization is available on CDC's flu antigenic
characterization page.

#### Antiviral Resistance Testing

Virus are tested to determine if they are resistant to any of the FDA-approved
flu antiviral drugs. This information helps shape public health policy
recommendations on the use of flu antiviral medications. CDC currently
recommends use of the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs to
prevent and treat flu illness in the United States. The neuraminidase
inhibitors are drugs designed to bind to the neuraminidase protein on the
surface of a flu virus to prevent the virus from replicating in the host.
(More information about flu antiviral drugs is available at Treatment -
Antiviral Drugs.) Antiviral resistance testing includes sequencing as well as
a specific functional assay, the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay, to see
whether virus replication is inhibited by the presence of the neuraminidase
drugs.

#### Serology

Serology is the study of blood serum. Serum contains antibodies, which are
proteins produced by the body in response to infection or vaccination.
Antibodies play an essential role in protection against flu viruses. CDC's flu
serology research involves the study of antibodies in human populations to
better understand whether people have any existing protection against
different flu viruses. These studies can tell public health officials whether
people in the study population are susceptible to infection with a particular
virus or if they have existing immune protection against infection. This
information is important for determining a virus' pandemic potential or
ability to spread through a population. In addition, serology is used to
determine whether vaccines developed against specific flu viruses are likely
to offer adequate protection and whether this protection is likely to be
effective against newly emerging flu viruses.

#### Animal testing

CDC conducts animal studies using zoonotic flu viruses of public health
concern to better understand these viruses, such as how transmissible they are
in mammals, their disease severity and disease characteristics, and to test
the efficacy of vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions against them.

### How has CDC research helped to improve testing for zoonotic flu viruses of
public health concern, such as bird flu?

CDC research has strengthened the ability of the United States and foreign
countries to detect zoonotic flu viruses of public health concern. For
example, in February 2006 and September 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) cleared new CDC developed molecular laboratory tests to
aid in the diagnosis of Asian A(H5N1) bird flu viruses in human respiratory
specimens. CDC has since expanded its molecular test kits to detect other flu
viruses, such as Asian A(H7N9) bird flu virus, which began causing human
infections in China in 2013. CDC's test kits have been made available to state
public health laboratories and have been shared globally with World Health
Organization (WHO) collaborating centers and international influenza testing
centers.

### What is "dual use research of concern (DURC)?"

Some types of flu research that are beneficial to society also fall into a
category called "dual use research of concern" (DURC). DURC is defined as life
sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably
anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that
could be potentially misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad
potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and
other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security. More
information about DURC is available at Dual Use Research of Concern and Bird
Flu: Questions & Answers.
