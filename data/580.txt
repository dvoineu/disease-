## Summary

A urinalysis is a test of your urine. It is often done to check for a urinary
tract infections, kidney problems, or diabetes. You may also have one during a
checkup, if you are admitted to the hospital, before you have surgery, or if
you are pregnant. It can also monitor some medical conditions and treatments.

A urinalysis involves checking the urine for

    * Its color
    * Its appearance (whether it is clear or cloudy)
    * Any odor
    * The pH level (acidity)
    * Whether there are substances that are not normally in urine, such as blood, too much protein, glucose, ketones, and bilirubin
    * Whether there are cells, crystals, and casts (tube-shaped proteins)
    * Whether it contains bacteria or other germs
