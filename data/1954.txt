## Summary

Health facilities are places that provide health care. They include hospitals,
clinics, outpatient care centers, and specialized care centers, such as
birthing centers and psychiatric care centers.

When you choose a health facility, you might want to consider

    * How close it is to where you live or work
    * Whether your health insurance will pay for services there
    * Whether your health care provider can treat you there
    * The quality of the facility

Quality is important. Some facilities do a better job than others. One way to
learn about the quality of a facility is to look at report cards developed by
federal, state, and consumer groups.
