A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) smear is a laboratory test to look for bacteria,
fungi, and viruses in the fluid that moves in the space around the spinal cord
and brain. CSF protects the brain and spinal cord from injury.

## How the Test is Performed

A sample of CSF is needed. This is usually done with a lumbar puncture, or a
spinal tap.

The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a tiny amount is spread on a glass
slide. Laboratory staff then views the sample under a microscope. The smear
shows the color of the fluid and the number and shape of cells present in the
fluid. Other tests may be done to check for bacteria or fungi in the sample.

## How to Prepare for the Test

Follow instructions on how to prepare for a spinal tap.

## Why the Test is Performed

Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an
infection that affects the brain or nervous system. The test helps identify
what is causing the infection. This will help your provider decide on the best
treatment.

## Normal Results

A normal test result means there are no signs of an infection. This is also
called a negative result. However, a normal result doesn't mean that there is
no infection. The spinal tap and CSF smear may need to be done again.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Bacteria or other germs found in the sample may be a sign of meningitis. This
is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The
infection can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.

## Risks

A laboratory smear poses no risk. Your provider will tell you about the risks
of a spinal tap.

## Alternative Names

Spinal fluid smear; Cerebrospinal fluid smear
