CDC's programs that prevent and control HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), and tuberculosis protect the nation and help
Americans lead healthier and longer lives.

CDC uses the results of high quality research to identify and give funding
priority to interventions that are proven to work and are cost-effective and
when implemented on a scale will achieve the greatest impact.

CDC's laboratories advance the use of vital discoveries and cutting-edge
technology to support state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments
as they respond to disease outbreaks. Further, CDC provides financial
assistance and assigns federal employees with on-the-ground experience to the
field to reduce new HIV, viral hepatitis, STD, and tuberculosis infections,
link those who test positive to care and treatment, and prevent death. CDC
works to decrease health disparities while preventing infections throughout
the nation, and helps to keep teens healthy by educating them on avoiding
risky behavior.

TB prevention saves lives and saves money.

Over the past 15 years, public health prevention programs prevented 5.7
million cases of gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, and 3,500 cases of STI-
attributable HIV, saving $1.3 billion in lifetime medical costs.
