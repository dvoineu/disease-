## Summary

A biopsy is a procedure that removes cells or tissue from your body. A doctor
called a pathologist looks at the cells or tissue under a microscope to check
for damage or disease. The pathologist may also do other tests on it.

Biopsies can be done on all parts of the body. In most cases, a biopsy is the
only test that can tell for sure if a suspicious area is cancer. But biopsies
are performed for many other reasons too.

There are different types of biopsies. A needle biopsy removes tissue with a
needle passed through your skin to the site of the problem. Other kinds of
biopsies may require surgery.
