## Summary

As a patient, you have certain rights. Some are guaranteed by federal law,
such as the right to get a copy of your medical records, and the right to keep
them private. Many states have additional laws protecting patients, and health
care facilities often have a patient bill of rights.

An important patient right is informed consent. This means that if you need a
treatment, your health care provider must give you the information you need to
make a decision.

Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems.
Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care. Your
state's department of health may also be able to help.
