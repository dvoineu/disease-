## Summary

You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you
might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM
is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard
care. Examples of CAM therapies are acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal
medicines.

People with cancer may use CAM to

  * Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments
  * Ease worries of cancer treatment and related stress
  * Feel that they are doing something more to help their own care

CAM treatments do not work for everyone. Some methods, such as acupuncture,
might help with nausea, pain and other side effects of cancer treatment. Talk
to your doctor to make sure that all aspects of your cancer care work
together.
