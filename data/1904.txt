###  What Is COPD?

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of diseases
that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. COPD includes
emphysema; chronic bronchitis; and in some cases, asthma.1

With COPD, less air flows through the airways--the tubes that carry air in and
out of your lungs--because of one or more of the following:2,3

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The airways and tiny air sacs in the lungs lose their ability to stretch and shrink back.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed (irritated and swollen).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The airways make more mucus than usual, which can clog them and block air flow.

In the early stages of COPD, there may be no symptoms, or you may only have
mild symptoms, such as:4

How severe your COPD symptoms are depends on how damaged your lungs are. If
you keep smoking, the damage will get worse faster than if you stop smoking.4
Among 15 million U.S. adults with COPD, 39% continue to smoke.5

###  How Is Smoking Related to COPD?

COPD is usually caused by smoking.3   Smoking accounts for as many as 8 out of
10 COPD-related deaths.6 However, as many as 1 out of 4 Americans with COPD
never smoked cigarettes.5

Smoking during childhood and teenage years can slow how lungs grow and
develop. This can increase the risk of developing COPD in adulthood.7

###  How Can COPD Be Prevented?

The best way to prevent COPD is to never start smoking, and if you smoke,
quit.8 Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you
quit. Also, stay away from secondhand smoke, which is smoke from burning
tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, or pipes.6,9,10  Secondhand
smoke also is smoke that has been exhaled, or breathed out, by a person
smoking.9,10

###  How Is COPD Treated?

Treatment of COPD requires a careful and thorough exam by a doctor.1 Quitting
smoking is the most important first step you can take to treat COPD. Avoiding
secondhand smoke is also critical. Other lifestyle changes and treatments
include one or more of the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * For people with COPD who have trouble eating because of shortness of breath or being tired:11

can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and slow the progress of the
disease.11
