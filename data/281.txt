## Summary

Playing sports can be fun, but it can also be dangerous if you are not
careful. You can help prevent injuries by

  * Getting a physical to make sure you are healthy before you start playing your sport
  * Wearing the right shoes, gear, and equipment 
  * Drinking lots of water 
  * Warming up and stretching

If you have already hurt yourself playing a sport, make sure you recover
completely before you start up again. If possible, protect the injured part of
your body with padding, a brace, or special equipment. When you do start
playing again, start slowly.
