﻿

**CDC 's OFFICE ON SMOKING AND HEALTH (OSH) **is the lead federal agency for
comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. OSH saves lives and saves money
by preventing and reducing tobacco use - the leading cause of preventable
disease and death in the U.S.

**Even if you haven 't heard of OSH, you've probably seen or felt the impact
of our work:**

![Circle image icon of a television and says, ](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-
states/images/circle1.jpg)

through CDC's **_Tips From Former Smokers_ ® ad campaign** that has inspired 1
million Americans to quit smoking from 2012 to 2018 **.**

![Circle image icon of a headset and 1-800-Quit-Now and says,
](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/circle2.jpg)

through **1-800-QUIT-NOW** , which links callers to their state quitline and
receives critical support from OSH.

![Circle image icon of a newspaper and says, ](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-
states/images/circle3.jpg)

which covers  **OSH experts ' reports and studies **about tobacco use and
secondhand smoke exposure.

![Circle image icon of people and says, ](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-
states/images/circle4.jpg)

if you or someone you know has quit smoking because of OSH's work to support
and encourage  
**tobacco cessation**.

![Circle image icon of a handshake and says, ](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-

if you enjoy  **smokefree indoor air protections  **in public places that have
been expanded because of our scientific research.

![80% - More than 80% of OSH's budget supports state and local tobacco control

![80% - More than 80% of OSH's budget supports state and local tobacco control
efforts](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/80-percent-arrow-mobile.jpg)

![The number 1](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/one.jpg)

CDC's **National Tobacco Control Program (NTCP)** is the only nationwide
investment that supports all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 8 U.S.
territories, and 27 tribal organizations for comprehensive tobacco control
efforts and quitlines.

![Icon of money](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/money.jpg)

States use OSH funds to prevent kids from using tobacco, reduce secondhand
smoke exposure, help smokers quit, and reduce disparities in tobacco use. For
every $1 spent on strong tobacco control programs, states achieve a $55 return
on investment, mostly in averted health care costs to treat smoking related
illness.

![The number 2](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/two.jpg)

CDC's _**Tips From Former Smokers ® **_**campaign** is the only national media
campaign focused on inspiring the 7 in 10 American adults who smoke and want
to quit. _Tips_ ® features real people--not actors--suffering from the health
consequences of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. It connects people who
smoke with resources, including a free quitline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW, to help them
quit. CDC **supports state and territorial quitlines** to respond to the
immediate and sustained spikes in call volumes they receive when the Tips
campaign is on air.

![Icon of money](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/money.jpg)

_Tips_ saves states money. CDC's ad development, placement, and evaluation
allows states to invest in ad placement during times and in areas not reached
by CDC's _Tips_ campaign. CDC's supplemental quitline support helps states
meet the demands for cessation support generated by the campaign.

![The number 3](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/three.jpg)

CDC funds **data collection, evaluation, research and laboratory activities**
to monitor tobacco use and its health effects among U.S. youth and adults. OSH
supports the state-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and with FDA, supports the
school-based National Youth Tobacco Survey, the nation's premier survey of
youth tobacco use.

![Icon of money](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/money.jpg)

National level surveillance systems provide consistent, reliable, and cost-
effective data collection. CDC data are used by states and others to evaluate
their work and monitor progress.

**How does OSH 's coordination at the Federal level serve states?**  
_OSH provides the critical linkages, expertise, resources, and technical
assistance states need to maximize impact and minimize duplication._

![Icon image of books](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/books-icon.jpg)

**Documenting the problem**. OSH produces Surgeon General's Reports (SGRs)
that form the basis of our understanding of the health effects of tobacco use,
secondhand smoke exposure, and evidence-­based tobacco control strategies. And
OSH's epidemiologists regularly publish high-­quality reports on tobacco use
trends that states use to monitor progress, prioritize interventions, and
reduce disparities. For SGRs, visit:
cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/index.htm.

states/images/mag-glass-icon.jpg)

**Identifying best practices**. OSH experts identify what works in tobacco
control so that states don't have to reinvent the wheel to tackle the problem.
OSH regularly updates its guide, Best Practices for Tobacco Control Programs,
which outlines how states can develop, implement, and budget for an
evidencebased tobacco control program. For more, visit:
cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/best_practices/index.htm.

**Providing technical assistance and linkages for states and health systems**.
OSH provides one-on-one technical assistance for state tobacco control
programs, partners with states and health systems working to improve insurance
coverage of cessation treatments, and creates opportunities for states to
regularly hear from one another and share best practices. For more, visit:
cdc.gov/sixeighteen/tobacco/index.htm.

**Sharing media resources**. Through the Media Campaign Resource Center
(MCRC), OSH provides access to existing tobacco education advertisements,
allowing state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments and other
organizations to save the time and high cost of producing new ads. Among the
ads offered are those from CDC's national tobacco education campaign, _Tips
From Former Smokers_ ®--a valuable asset given its research-based development
process and proven effectiveness. Visit the MCRC at cdc.gov/tobacco/mcrc.

![Icon image of e-cigarette](/tobacco/about/osh/serves-states/images/ecig-
icon.jpg)

**Educating the public about tobacco use and young people**. For example, OSH
implemented a "Protecting Young People from E-cigarettes" communication
initiative to raise awareness among parents, educators, and health care
providers about the risks of e-cigarette use among young people. Communication
materials included print and radio PSAs; social media and digital display ads;
fact sheets; presentation for delivery to youth audiences; partner toolkit;
and web pages for syndication. These resources make science accessible to the
public and reduce the need for states to develop their own materials. For
more, visit cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes.

**Tracking and visualizing data**. Through OSHData, OSH presents comprehensive
tobacco prevention and control data online in an easy to use, interactive
application available to states, researchers, media, and the public. Visit
OSHData at cdc.gov/oshdata.
