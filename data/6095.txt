In addition, children who have previously experienced trauma or have a pre-
existing mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral disorder can be
particularly vulnerable before a disaster occurs. For example, children with
autism, as well as infants and toddlers, may have difficulty communicating
their thoughts and feelings. Parents and caregivers can take steps to help
their children cope with traumatic events.

If family members cannot return to their home, having an alternative meeting location, such as a community center, can help them reunite after a disaster.

Since drills vary by state, you can also look on your state's Department of Educationexternal icon web page.

You can also correct misinformation about the event.
