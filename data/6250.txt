Joint swelling is the buildup of fluid in the soft tissue surrounding the
joint.

## Considerations

Joint swelling may occur along with joint pain. The swelling may cause the
joint to appear larger or abnormally shaped.

Joint swelling can cause pain or stiffness. After an injury, swelling of the
joint may mean you have a broken bone or a tear in the muscle tendon or
ligament.

Many different types of arthritis may cause swelling, redness, or warmth
around the joint.

An infection in the joint can cause swelling, pain, and fever.

## Causes

Joint swelling may be caused by different conditions, including:

      * Chronic type of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis
      * Painful type of arthritis caused by buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint (gout)
      * Arthritis caused by wear and tear of joints (osteoarthritis)
      * Arthritis caused by buildup of calcium-type crystals in joints (pseudogout)
      * Disorder that involves arthritis and a skin condition called psoriasis (psoriatic arthritis)
      * Group of conditions that involve the joints, eyes, and urinary and genital systems (reactive arthritis)
      * Inflammation of joints, nearby tissues, and sometimes other organs (rheumatoid arthritis)
      * Inflammation of a joint due to an infection (septic arthritis)
      * Disorder in which the body's immune system attacks healthy tissue (systemic lupus erythematosus)

## Home Care

For joint swelling after an injury, apply ice packs to reduce pain and
swelling. Raise the swollen joint so that it is higher than your heart, if
possible. For example, if your ankle is swollen, lay down with pillows
comfortably placed under your foot so that your ankle and leg are slightly
raised.

If you have arthritis, follow your health care provider's treatment plan.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider right away if you have joint pain and swelling with a
fever.

Also call your provider if you have:

      * Unexplained joint swelling
      * Joint swelling after an injury 

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will examine you. The joint will be closely examined. You will
be asked about your joint swelling, such as when it began, how long it has
lasted, and whether you have it all the time or only at certain times. You may
also be asked what you have tried at home to relieve the swelling.

Tests to diagnose the cause of joint swelling may include:

      * Blood tests
      * Joint x-rays
      * Joint aspiration and examination of joint fluid

Physical therapy for muscle and joint rehabilitation may be recommended.
