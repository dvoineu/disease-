## Summary

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) happens when a woman's ovaries or adrenal
glands produce more male hormones than normal. PCOS causes cysts (fluid-filled
sacs) to grow on the ovaries. Symptoms include

    * Irregular menstrual periods
    * Infertility
    * Pelvic pain
    * Excess hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, or thighs
    * Weight gain
    * Acne or oily skin
    * Patches of thickened skin

Women with PCOS are at higher risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart
disease, and high blood pressure.

PCOS is more common in women who have obesity, or have a mother or sister with
PCOS. To diagnose PCOS, your health care provider may do a physical exam,
pelvic exam, blood tests, and an ultrasound.

There is no cure, but diet, exercise, and medicines can help control the
symptoms. Birth control pills help women have normal periods, reduce male
hormone levels, and clear acne. Treatments for infertility caused by PCOS may
include medicines, surgery, and in vitro fertilization (IVF).
