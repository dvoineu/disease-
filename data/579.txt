## Summary

It can be scary when your baby is sick, especially when it is not an everyday
problem like a cold or a fever. You may not know whether the problem is
serious or how to treat it. If you have concerns about your baby's health,
call your health care provider right away.

Learning information about your baby's condition can help ease your worry. Do
not be afraid to ask questions about your baby's care. By working together
with your health care provider, you make sure that your baby gets the best
care possible.
