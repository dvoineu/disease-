### Causal Agents

The trematode _Heterophyes heterophyes_ , a minute intestinal fluke.

### Life Cycle

![lifecycle](/dpdx/heterophyiasis/modules/Heterophyes_LifeCycle.gif)

Adults release embryonated eggs each with a fully-developed miracidium, and
eggs are passed in the host's feces![The number
1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif) .
After ingestion by a suitable snail (first intermediate host), the eggs hatch
and release miracidia which penetrate the snail's intestine![The number
2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). Genera
_Cerithidia_ and _Pironella_ are important snail hosts in Asia and the Middle
East respectively. The miracidia undergo several developmental stages in the
snail, i.e. sporocysts![The number
2a](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2a.gif),
rediae![The number
2b](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2b.gif), and
cercariae![The number
2c](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2c.gif). Many
cercariae are produced from each redia. The cercariae are released from the
snail![The number
3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif) and
encyst as metacercariae in the tissues of a suitable fresh/brackish water fish
(second intermediate host)![The number
4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). The
definitive host becomes infected by ingesting undercooked or salted fish
containing metacercariae![The number
5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_5.gif). After
ingestion, the metacercariae excyst, attach to the mucosa of the small
intestine![The number
6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif)
and mature into adults (measuring 1.0 to 1.7 mm by 0.3 to 0.4 mm)![The number
7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif).
In addition to humans, various fish-eating mammals (e.g., cats and dogs) and
birds can be infected by _Heterophyes heterophyes_ ![The number
8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif).

### Geographic Distribution

Egypt, the Middle East, and Far East.

### Clinical Presentation

The main symptoms are diarrhea and colicky abdominal pain. Migration of the
eggs to the heart, resulting in potentially fatal myocardial and valvular
damage, has been reported from the Philippines. Migration to other organs
(e.g., brain) has also been reported.



##### Adult of _Heterophyes heterophyes_.



Adults of _Heterophyes heterophyes_ are minute flukes, measuring 1-2 mm in
length. The tests are large and paired, and are situated near a small ovary.
The surface of the worm is covered with minute spines. Adults reside in the
small intestine of the definitive host.

##### Snail intermediate hosts of _Heterophyes heterophyes_.



Like all trematodes, _Heterophyes heterophyes_ requires a snail as an
intermediate host. _Cerithideopsilla cingulata_ is the main first intermediate
host for _H. heterophyes_ in southeast Asia.

### Laboratory Diagnosis

The diagnosis is based on the microscopic identification of eggs in the stool.
However, the eggs are indistinguishable from those of _Metagonimus yokogawai_
and resemble those of _Clonorchis_ and _Opisthorchis_.
