## Summary

Your child's health includes physical, mental and social well-being. Most
parents know the basics of keeping children healthy, like offering them
healthy foods, making sure they get enough sleep and exercise and insuring
their safety.

It is also important for children to get regular checkups with their health
care provider. These visits are a chance to check your child's development.
They are also a good time to catch or prevent problems.

Other than checkups, school-age children should be seen for

    * Significant weight gain or loss
    * Sleep problems or change in behavior
    * Fever higher than 102
    * Rashes or skin infections
    * Frequent sore throats
    * Breathing problems
