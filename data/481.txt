## Summary

Strep is short for Streptococcus, a type of bacteria. There are several types.
Two of them cause most of the strep infections in people: group A and group B.

Group A strep causes

    * Strep throat - a sore, red throat. Your tonsils may be swollen and have white spots on them.
    * Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.
    * Impetigo \- a skin infection
    * Toxic shock syndrome
    * Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)

Group B strep can cause blood infections, pneumonia and meningitis in
newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you
do, intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life.
Adults can also get group B strep infections, especially if they are 65 or
older or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract
infections, blood infections, skin infections and pneumonia in adults.

Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.
