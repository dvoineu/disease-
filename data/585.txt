## Summary

Ultrasound is a type of imaging. It uses high-frequency sound waves to look at
organs and structures inside the body. Health care professionals use it to
view the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver, and other organs. During
pregnancy, doctors use ultrasound to view the fetus. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound
does not expose you to radiation.

During an ultrasound test, you lie on a table. A special technician or doctor
moves a device called a transducer over part of your body. The transducer
sends out sound waves, which bounce off the tissues inside your body. The
transducer also captures the waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine
creates images from the sound waves.
