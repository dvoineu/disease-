## Summary

The B vitamins are

  * B1 (thiamine)
  * B2 (riboflavin)
  * B3 (niacin)
  * B5 (pantothenic acid)
  * B6
  * B7 (biotin)
  * B12
  * Folic acid

These vitamins help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the
food you eat. They also help form red blood cells. You can get B vitamins from
proteins such as fish, poultry, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Leafy green
vegetables, beans, and peas also have B vitamins. Many cereals and some breads
have added B vitamins.

Not getting enough of certain B vitamins can cause diseases. A lack of B12 or
B6 can cause anemia.
