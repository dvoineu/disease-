## Summary

Craniofacial is a medical term that relates to the bones of the skull and
face. Craniofacial abnormalities are birth defects of the face or head. Some,
like cleft lip and palate, are among the most common of all birth defects.
Others are very rare. Most of them affect how a person's face or head looks.
These conditions may also affect other parts of the body.

Treatment depends on the type of problem. Plastic and reconstructive surgery
may help the person's appearance.
