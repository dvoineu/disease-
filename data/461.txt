# Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Tennessee Infections Linked to Peanut
Butter (FINAL UPDATE)

Posted March 7, 2007

## Outbreak Summary

Public health officials in multiple states, with the assistance of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), are investigating a large multistate outbreak of
_Salmonella_ serotype Tennessee infections. An epidemiologic study comparing
foods that ill and well persons said they ate showed that consumption of Peter
Pan peanut butter and Great Value peanut butter were both statistically
associated with illness and therefore the likely source of the outbreak.
Product testing has confirmed the presence of the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Tennessee in opened jars of peanut butter obtained from ill
persons.

FDA has advised consumers not to eat any Peter Pan peanut butter and not to
eat Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with 2111. Peter
Pan peanut butter is made in a single facility in Georgia. Great Value peanut
butter with a product code beginning with 2111 is made in the same facility as
Peter Pan peanut butter; Great Value peanut butter made by other manufacturers
is not affected.  
As of March 7th at 12 PM EST, 425 persons infected with the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Tennessee have been reported to CDC from 44 states. Among 351
patients for whom clinical information is available, 71 (20%) were
hospitalized. No deaths have been attributed to this infection. Onset dates,
which are known for 301 patients, ranged from August 1, 2006 to February 16,
2007, and 67% of these illnesses began after December 1, 2006.

PulseNet (the national subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance
coordinated by CDC) detected a slowly rising increase in cases of _Salmonella_
Tennessee this fall. OutbreakNet (the national network of public health
officials coordinated by CDC that investigates enteric disease outbreaks) then
worked for several weeks to identify this unusual food vehicle.

Public health officials from several states have isolated _Salmonella_ from
open jars of peanut butter of both Peter Pan and Great Value brand. For
fifteen jars, the serotype has been confirmed as Tennessee and DNA
fingerprinting has shown that the pattern is the outbreak strain.

FDA officials and the peanut butter manufacturer are working collaboratively
to learn more about production of peanut butter to determine how it may have
become contaminated.

Persons who think they may have become ill from eating peanut butter are
advised to consult their health care provider. Persons who have Peter Pan
peanut butter or Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with
2111 should discard the jar. Local health departments no longer need to
collect jars for testing.

Most persons infected with _Salmonella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal
cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days,
and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons the
diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. The
elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to
have a severe illness.

The states that have reported cases are Alaska (1 case), Alabama (10),
Arkansas (3), Arizona (5), California (5), Colorado (13), Connecticut (3),
Delaware (1), Florida (7), Georgia (21), Iowa (8), Illinois (11), Indiana

States in Blue With Reported Cases

## Questions and Answers Related to this Outbreak

**What types of peanut butter are affected?**

All jars of Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006 and Great Value
peanut butter with a product code beginning with 2111 purchased since May 2006
may be affected.

**I have a jar of Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006 or a jar of
Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with the number "2111"
stamped on the lid that has been purchased since May 2006, and I/my children
ate some of it, but no one is sick. What should I do?**

Do not eat any more of the peanut butter. Throw away the jar. If anyone in
your family develops severe diarrheal illness with bloody diarrhea, fever, or
symptoms lasting more than three days, they should consult a healthcare
provider.

**I/my household member ate Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006
or a jar of Great Value peanut butter that has been purchased since May 2006
peanut butter with a product code beginning with the number "2111" stamped on
the lid that has been purchased since May 2006 and I/my household member is
ill with diarrhea. I still have the jar. What should I do?**

Do not eat any more of the peanut butter. Throw away the jar.  If the
diarrheal illness is severe with bloody diarrhea, fever, or symptoms lasting
more than three days, you should consult a healthcare provider.

**I/my household member ate Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006
or a jar of Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with the
number "2111" stamped on the lid that has been purchased since May 2006 and
I/my household member is ill with diarrhea. I no longer have the container of
peanut butter. What should I do?**

If the diarrheal illness is severe with bloody diarrhea, fever, or symptoms
lasting more than three days, you should consult a healthcare provider.

**I/my household member ate peanut butter that is not the Peter Pan or Great
Value brand, and I/my household member is ill with diarrhea. I still have the
jar. What should I do?**

There's no evidence that this illness has been caused by the peanut butter you
are describing. If the illness is severe with bloody diarrhea, fever, or
symptoms lasting more than three days, you should consult a healthcare
provider.

**I have a jar of peanut butter that is not the Peter Pan or Great Value brand
and I/my children ate some of it, but no one is sick. What should I do?**

There is no need to do anything differently. You may consume the peanut butter
with confidence.

## Questions and Answers Related to this Outbreak and Pets

**How do I know if my dog or cat has _Salmonella_ related to this outbreak?**

If you have fed your dog or cat Peter Pan/Great Value peanut butter with the
product code "2111" stamped on the lid, please look for the following signs.
Dogs and cats that become ill from _Salmonella_ generally will have diarrhea
that may contain blood or mucus and fever. Affected animals may seem more
tired than usual, and may have vomiting. Some cats do not have diarrhea, but
will have a decreased appetite, fever, and excess salivation.  

If your dog or cat has these signs, please contact your veterinarian. Do not
feed anymore of the above mentioned peanut butter to your pet. Throw away the
peanut butter.

**How are _Salmonella_ infections diagnosed and treated in dogs and cats?**

A stool sample can be tested to diagnose Salmonellosis along with oral cavity
swabs and identification of the organism in blood. _Salmonella_ infections
require prompt treatment with supportive care and fluids. Treatment of
Salmonellosis with antibiotics is necessary for severe cases.

**What can I do to prevent the spread of _Salmonella_ from my pets?**

_Salmonella_ can be shed in the stool of pets for 4-6 weeks after infection.
If your pet is diagnosed with _Salmonella_ , please talk to your veterinarian
about taking precautions to minimize spread of the germ. Be careful to pick up
stool and dispose of properly. Wash your hands after petting and cleaning up
after your pet, particularly before eating or preparing food. A mild bleach
solution can be used to clean areas that may be contaminated with
_Salmonella_.
