## Summary

Accidents happen. Someone chokes on an ice cube or gets stung by a bee. It is
important to know when to call 911 -- it is for life-threatening emergencies.
While waiting for help to arrive, you may be able to save someone's life.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is for people whose hearts or breathing
has stopped and the Heimlich maneuver is for people who are choking.

You can also learn to handle common injuries and wounds. Cuts and scrapes, for
example, should be rinsed with cool water. To stop bleeding, apply firm but
gentle pressure, using gauze. If blood soaks through, add more gauze, keeping
the first layer in place. Continue to apply pressure.

It is important to have a first aid kit available. Keep one at home and one in
your car. It should include a first-aid guide. Read the guide to learn how to
use the items, so you are ready in case an emergency happens.
