#  Drowning

## Summary

People drown when they get too much water in their lungs. You can drown in as
little as an inch or two of water. Babies can drown in a sink or bathtub.
Preschoolers are most likely to drown in a swimming pool. People who have
seizure disorders are also at risk in the water. Drowning can happen quickly
and silently.

Drowning precautions should include

    * Fences around pools
    * Supervising children near any body of water, including tubs
    * Not swimming or boating when under the influence of alcohol or sedatives
    * Wearing life jackets when boating
    * Learning CPR
