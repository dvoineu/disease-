## Summary

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no odor or color. But it is very
dangerous. It can cause sudden illness and death. CO is found in combustion
fumes, such as those made by cars and trucks, lanterns, stoves, gas ranges and
heating systems. CO from these fumes can build up in places that don't have a
good flow of fresh air. You can be poisoned by breathing them in. The most
common symptoms of CO poisoning are

    * Headache
    * Dizziness
    * Weakness
    * Nausea
    * Vomiting
    * Chest pain
    * Confusion

It is often hard to tell if someone has CO poisoning, because the symptoms may
be like those of other illnesses. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can
die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. A CO detector can warn you if
you have high levels of CO in your home.
