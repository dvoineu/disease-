## Summary

Urinary incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. Symptoms can range from
mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. It can happen to anyone, but it
becomes more common with age. Women experience UI twice as often as men.

Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active.
If the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak, you may have accidents
when you sneeze, laugh or lift a heavy object. This is stress incontinence. If
bladder muscles become too active, you may feel a strong urge to go to the
bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence
or overactive bladder. There are other causes of incontinence, such as
prostate problems and nerve damage.

Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your
lifestyle. It may include simple exercises, medicines, special devices or
procedures prescribed by your doctor, or surgery.
