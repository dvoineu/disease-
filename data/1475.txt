Adult pubic lice are 1.1-1.8 mm in length. Pubic lice typically are found
attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair
elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache,
chest, armpits, etc.).

Pubic lice infestations (pthiriasis) are usually spread through sexual
contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the transmission of
human pubic lice.

Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available for treatment
of pubic lice infestations.
