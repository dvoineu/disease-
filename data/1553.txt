### Your story could help provide support to other families or individuals.

CDC is looking for a variety of experiences and perspectives on living with
different birth defects. View our story webpage for examples.

If you have submitted a story to us in the past, we'd love an update on how
you and your family are doing today!

In your submission, please include a story of 500-700 words and a large, high-
quality photo, if possible.
