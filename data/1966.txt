###  What is Cancer?

Cancer refers to diseases in which abnormal cells divide out of control and
are able to invade other tissues. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of
the body through the blood and lymph systems, which help the body get rid of
toxins.1,2

There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for
the organ or type of cell in which they start--for example, lung cancer begins
in the lung and laryngeal cancer begins in the larynx (voice box).1

Symptoms can include:3

###  How Is Smoking Related to Cancer?

Smoking can cause cancer and then block your body from fighting it:4

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken the body's immune system, making it harder to kill cancer cells. When this happens, cancer cells keep growing without being stopped.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Poisons in tobacco smoke can damage or change a cell's DNA. DNA is the cell's "instruction manual" that controls a cell's normal growth and function. When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumor.

Doctors have known for years that smoking causes most lung cancers. It's still
true today, when nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers are caused by smoking
cigarettes. In fact, smokers have a greater risk for lung cancer today than
they did in 1964, even though they smoke fewer cigarettes. One reason may be
changes in how cigarettes are made and what chemicals they contain.5

Treatments are getting better for lung cancer, but it still kills more men and
women than any other type of cancer. In the United States, more than 7,300
nonsmokers die each year from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.6
Secondhand smoke is the combination of smoke from the burning end of a
cigarette and the smoke breathed out by smokers.

Smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in your body, including the:5

###  How Can Smoking-Related Cancers Be Prevented?

Quitting smoking lowers the risks for cancers of the lung, mouth, throat,
esophagus, and larynx.4,8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Within 5 years of quitting, your chance of getting cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder is cut in half.4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Ten years after you quit smoking, your risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half.4

If nobody smoked, one of every three cancer deaths in the United States would
not happen.4

###  Cancer Screening

#### Screening for Cervical and Colorectal Cancers

Research shows that screening for cervical and colorectal cancers, as
recommended, helps prevent these diseases.  Screening for cervical and
colorectal cancers helps find these diseases at an early, and often highly
treatable, stage. CDC offers free or low-cost cervical cancer screening
nationwide.2

Health care reform through the Affordable Care Act increases access to
cervical and colorectal cancer screening through expanded insurance coverage
and eliminating cost-sharing. In addition, CDC's _Screen for Life: National
Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign_ informs men and women aged 50 years and
older about the importance of having regular colorectal cancer screening
tests.9

#### Screening for Lung Cancer

People who have smoked for many years may consider screening for lung cancer
with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Talk to your doctor about lung
cancer screening and the possible benefits and risks. Lung cancer screening is
not a substitute for quitting smoking.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung
cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults aged 55 to 80 years who
have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within
the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not
smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits
life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery.14

###  How Is Cancer Treated?

The treatment for cancer depends on the type of cancer and the stage of the
disease (how severe the cancer is and whether it has spread). Doctors may also
consider the patient's age and general health. Often, the goal of treatment is
to cure the cancer. In other cases, the goal is to control the disease or to
reduce symptoms for as long as possible. The treatment plan for a person may
change over time.7

Most treatment plans include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
Other plans involve biological therapy (a treatment that helps your immune
system fight cancer).3

Some cancers respond best to a single type of treatment. Other cancers may
respond best to a combination of treatments.3

For patients who get very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, a
stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant, may be
recommended by their doctor. This is because high-dose therapies destroy both
cancer cells and normal blood cells. A stem cell transplant can help the body
to make healthy blood cells to replace the ones lost due to the cancer
treatment. It's a complicated procedure with many side effects and risks.12

Quitting smoking improves the outlook (the prognosis) for people with cancer.
People who continue to smoke after diagnosis raise their risk for future
cancers and death. They are more likely to die from cancer than nonsmokers and
are more likely to develop a second (new) tobacco-related cancer.5,13

###  Colorectal Cancer and Ostomies

An ostomy (or stoma) is a surgical opening made to the body that allows waste
to be eliminated from the body.10 Ostomies are used in treatment or management
of cancer or other diseases.11 Ostomies are needed when the body's normal
opening is closed or altered as part of cancer treatment. An ostomy pouch is
located around the opening to collect waste for removal. Ostomies are usually
done during the first stages of surgical treatment to remove cancer.10 For
colorectal cancer patients, a colostomy (surgical openings from the bowel or
colon to the abdomen) can be a lifesaving surgery.10,11 An ostomy can be
temporary or permanent.10,11 Temporary ostomies are used while the affected
area of the body heals. Permanent ostomies are used when cancer has resulted
in the removal of the entire colon or the end of it.10,11
