#  Prader-Willi Syndrome

Also called: PWS

## Summary

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder. It causes poor muscle
tone, low levels of sex hormones and a constant feeling of hunger. The part of
the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly
in people with PWS. They overeat, leading to obesity.

Babies with PWS are usually floppy, with poor muscle tone, and have trouble
sucking. Boys may have undescended testicles. Later, other signs appear. These
include

    * Short stature
    * Poor motor skills
    * Weight gain 
    * Underdeveloped sex organs
    * Mild intellectual and learning disabilities

There is no cure for PWS. Growth hormone, exercise, and dietary supervision
can help build muscle mass and control weight. Other treatments may include
sex hormones and behavior therapy. Most people with PWS will need specialized
care and supervision throughout their lives.
