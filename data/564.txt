## Summary

Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material inside of a
protein coating. Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common
cold, flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS,
smallpox, and Ebola.

Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells and use those
cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill,
damage, or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack
certain cells in your body such as your liver, respiratory system, or blood.

When you get a virus, you may not always get sick from it. Your immune system
may be able to fight it off.

For most viral infections, treatments can only help with symptoms while you
wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work
for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral
infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.
