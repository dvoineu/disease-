## Cost-effective Rollover Protective Structures (CROPS)

The NIOSH Division of Safety Research and Protective Technology Branch has
developed a cost-effective rollover protective structures (CROPS) as an
alternative to installing commercially available ROPS, which are hard to find,
or as an option for older wheeled agricultural tractors for which ROPS are not
commercially available. CROPS have been designed for four tractor models: (1)
Ford 8N, (2) Ford 3000, (3) Ford 4000, and (4) Massey Ferguson 135. The NIOSH
CROPS for each of the tractor models listed was successfully tested in
accordance with Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) industry standard
performance test SAE J2194.

The available designs can be used either by

Certain parts must be manufactured by a facility that can bend 0.5-inch-thick
plate steel (A572-Grade 50). Other parts can be manufactured using a band saw
and a drill press. All welded parts must be welded by a professional welder
using the appropriate welding procedures for a minimum temperature of -22°F
(-30°C) as stated in the SAE J2194 standard. This is an absolute requirement
regardless of temperature ranges in the end users local area.

**_In addition to having a ROPS or CROPS on the tractor, the tractor operator
should always wear a seat belt for maximum protection in the event of a
tractor rollover._**

### Disclaimers

**Any deviation from the published designs or the installation of a CROPS on a
tractor for which it was not intended will invalidate the performance of the
CROPS. In the event of a rollover, operators will not be provided with the
level of protection established by SAE J2194.**

**NIOSH is providing these CROPS designs and installation instructions to the
public pursuant to its mission and is not offering any guarantee of any kind.
Any user of the designs and installation instructions agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the United States government from any claims, costs, damages or
losses that may arise from or through use of the designs and installation
instructions. It is further agreed that the user will not by its action bring
the United States government into any lawsuit involving the designs or
installation instructions.**

As of December 19, 2012, 82 NIOSH CROPS have been installed in the states of
New York, Virginia, Vermont, Pennsylvania, California, and West Virginia. The
installations in New York were facilitated by the New York Center for
Agricultural Medicine and Health (NYCAMH) at the NIOSH Northeast Center for
Agricultural and Occupational Health (NEC) located in Cooperstown, NY. The
installations in Vermont were facilitated by NYCAMH/NEC through a partnership
with the University of Vermont Extension. The installations in Virginia were
facilitated by the Virginia Farm Bureau. The installations in Pennsylvania are
facilitated through a partnership with The Pennsylvania State University. The
installations in California were facilitated by the University of California,
Davis and the West Virginia installation was facilitated by NIOSH. As of
December 19, 2012, these efforts led to 82 NIOSH CROPS installed on older
tractors in six states. ( View the 2012 Field Installation Pictures pdf
