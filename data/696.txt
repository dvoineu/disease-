## Summary

Parasites are living things that use other living things - like your body -
for food and a place to live. You can get them from contaminated food or
water, a bug bite, or sexual contact. Some parasitic diseases are easily
treated and some are not.

Parasites range in size from tiny, one-celled organisms called protozoa to
worms that can be seen with the naked eye. Some parasitic diseases occur in
the United States. Contaminated water supplies can lead to Giardia infections.
Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis, which is dangerous for pregnant women.
Others, like malaria, are common in other parts of the world.

If you are traveling, it's important to drink only water you know is safe.
Prevention is especially important. There are no vaccines for parasitic
diseases. Some medicines are available to treat parasitic infections.
