MedlinePlus Connect accepts and responds to requests for information based on
**diagnosis (problem) codes, medication codes** , and **laboratory test
codes**. When an EHR or patient portal submits a code request, MedlinePlus
Connect returns a response that includes links to relevant patient
information. MedlinePlus Connect can accept only one code per request.

MedlinePlus Connect is available as a Web application or a Web service.
MedlinePlus Connect can respond in English or Spanish.

## What is available to patients or providers within systems using MedlinePlus
Connect?

The Web application and Web service provide responses in different formats.
How it looks depends on how it is implemented.

### Web Application

The Web application returns a formatted response page. (Refer to image.) The
page is delivered to your EHR or other health system ready to use. The patient
or provider may select from the links on the MedlinePlus Connect response page
or go directly to the MedlinePlus website.

Visit the Web Application Demonstration page for more examples of Web
Application response pages.

### Web Service

The MedlinePlus Connect REST-based Web service provides access to the same
information as the Web Application but returns XML, JSON, or JSONP. This gives
users greater flexibility to tailor the display and delivery of the
information. Organizations can use the Web service response to incorporate
MedlinePlus information and links into any health IT interface. An
organization implementing the MedlinePlus Connect Web service may select which
MedlinePlus links and information to provide to the user.

Visit the Web Service Demonstration page for more examples of Web Service
response pages.
