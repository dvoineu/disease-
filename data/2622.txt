**TB Notes 2, 2016** **April 28, 2016**

### Notes from the Director

Dear Colleague:  
Last month, the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) released
preliminary TB surveillance data for the United States. According to data from
the CDC National TB Surveillance System, TB rates in the United States
remained approximately 3.0 cases per 100,000 persons during 2013-2015. In
2015, a total of 9,563 TB cases were reported. This represents an increase of
157 cases from the 9,406 cases reported in 2014.

Although we have seen two decades of declining incidence, progress toward TB
elimination in the U.S. appears to have stalled. We know there has been much
success in the early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of those with
infectious TB disease. However, to move the needle toward continued declines
in TB incidence in the U.S., we must also focus on diagnosing persons with
latent TB infection (LTBI) and treating them before they can progress to
active TB disease.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) supported this expanded
approach toward TB elimination with its recent draft recommendation statement.
The USPSTF issued a draft recommendation statementExternal that calls for
testing for adults who are at increased risk of having latent TB infection.
The period for public comments on the statement was March 8th through April
4th.

DTBE has announced a funding opportunityExternal to support these efforts. The
project seeks feasible and scalable programs that expand LTBI testing and
treatment to persons at high risk. The announcement was released on February
29th, but there is still time to apply. The closing date for applications is
May 4th.

Heartland National TB Center (HNTC) is offering a five-part web series
entitled _Effects of Co-morbidities on TB Nurse Case Management._ This series
is intended for nurses and health care staff who care for persons diagnosed
with TB and one or more co-morbidities.

The goal of this web series is to provide information from experts in the
field of the identified co-morbidity which can affect TB treatment. Each
session will also include a case study of a patient diagnosed with TB and an
identified co-morbidity by a TB nurse expert to highlight considerations in
case management.

Each session will provide 1.0 nursing continuation education contact hours.

Registration is FREE and required for each session; applicants will receive
notification of their enrollment status via email. Additional details can be
found on our website at www.heartlandntbc.org/training/.

**Corrections Liaison Partnership Committee**

CDC has recommended that a corrections liaison be appointed by the State TB
program for each state and territory in the U.S.  The National TB Controllers
Association (NTCA) Corrections Liaison Partnership Committee is a resource for
states and correctional liaisons. This group maintains a List of Corrections
Liaisons by State.   The list was last published in July 2015 and is currently
under revision.

Additionally, the liaisons hold quarterly calls to discuss working through the
Public Health Corrections Liaison Competencies and identifying how they work
with TB programs, correctional facilities, and the corrections culture. Items
covered in these calls include case scenarios, how to work with inmates, and
challenges with medical and custody staff.  Callers have the opportunity to
ask questions and identify training opportunities within each state and at
national conferences.  The group has discussed tips for speaking at sheriff
and jail conferences and how to use case scenarios to tailor training to
specific audiences.  They meet quarterly and keep the National Corrections
Committee apprised of the workgroup's initiatives.  If you are a correctional
liaison and would like to be added to the liaison list and/or the quarterly
calls, please contact Ellen Murray.

**NTCA Corrections Workgroup Activities**

For those searching for TB materials to use in correctional settings, the NTCA
Corrections Education and Training Workgroup developed a new repository of
materials, called CorrectTBExternal. The team is looking for additional
materials to add to the site.  If you have tools or educational materials that
you find useful in a correctional setting, please send them to the Corrections
Committee at ntca@tbcontrollers.org  with the subject line "CorrectTB
Resource(s)."

**3HP Explored in a National Webinar**

On March 17, 2016, the Curry International Tuberculosis Center (CITC) hosted a
national webinar titled, _INH and Rifapentine Treatment for LTBI: Expert
Opinions About 3HP Utilization._ The 90-minute event featured a panel of
experts discussing key issues faced by healthcare providers when using 3
months of isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly (3HP) to treat latent TB
infection (LTBI).

The topic of the 3HP treatment protocol is closely aligned with the national
TB elimination strategy of reducing TB cases by addressing the reservoir of
LTBI.  Training needs assessments conducted by CITC have long indicated a
strong interest among health providers for more information about the 3HP
regimen. Nevertheless, when CITC staff opened registration for the webinar,
they were astonished by the overwhelming response; there were over 900
registrants within the first 2 weeks.

The live webinar featured **Heidi Behm, RN, MPH** , TB Controller for the
Oregon Health Authority, who facilitated an expert panel comprised of:
**Marcos Burgos, MD** , New Mexico Department of Health; **Neha Shah, MD,
MPH** , CDC/California Department of Public Health; and **Mai Vu, PharmD** ,
San Francisco VA Medical Center.  

After Dr. Shah provided an overview of findings from clinical studies related
to 3HP, the panel directly explored an array of questions often posed by
providers who are using (or considering) the 3HP regimen for their patients:
How should missed doses be handled?; What are the most common drug-drug
interactions?; How can side effects be minimized?;  How does 3HP compare with
other LTBI regimens in terms of hepatotoxicity?; How does 3HP work for special
patient populations such as those who are elderly, diabetic, HIV-positive,
methadone users, coumadin users, and patients on dialysis?

During the webinar, participants commented about the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force Draft Recommendation Statement on LTBI ScreeningExternal that will
recommend testing for LTBI in at-risk adults. This recommendation could pave
the way for insurance coverage of TB testing.  

According to data gleaned from 411 participant evaluation responses, three-
fourths of attendees (77%) were nurses who work for TB control/public health
programs. The webinar was highly-rated by participants (average 8.94 of a
maximum of 10), who participated from all 50 states.  Many attendees indicated
the webinar content validated their current experience with 3HP; others
commented that the webinar left them better-equipped to initiate a 3HP program
in their facilities.  As one participant noted, "We are in the process of
implementing 3HP in our ambulatory care setting, so this was very helpful in
terms of ideas for protocols, monitoring, etc."

The _INH and Rifapentine Treatment for LTBI: Expert Opinions About 3HP
Utilization External _webinar is archived on the CITC website and available
for viewing.

Communications, Education, and Behavioral Studies Branch Updates

 **Big Improvements to DTBE 's Website Are Coming Soon**

Have you ever visited a website on your smartphone or tablet and quickly
become frustrated with having to resize the page, scroll, and search for basic
content?  If so, the site you visited was probably not in responsive design.
Responsive design is an approach to web design that adapts the layout to the
device, whether it's a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop monitor.

The percent of DTBE website users coming from mobile devices has been steadily
increasing over the years, while the percent of users from desktops has been
decreasing.  In fact, mobile users will soon be the majority user group.  In
May 2016, the DTBE website will transition to responsive design to ensure all
users have an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

In addition to design improvements, health communication staff in the
Communications, Education, and Behavioral Studies Branch (CEBSB) conducted
usability assessments to inform improvements in website layout, organization,
and navigation.  DTBE staff, and a group of 2016 TB Conference attendees,
completed three different web usability assessments. Together, these
assessments provide insight into the findability of website information, how
users think content should be organized, and their first impressions of a
redesigned homepage.  The findings directly inform decisions about topic
labeling, website navigation paths, and homepage layout.

Web metrics have also informed this process. Data from the American Customer
Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Adobe Site Catalyst metrics provide valuable
information such as which pages are most viewed, how long users spend on
pages, and file download frequencies.  CEBSB also analyzed results from open
response items to learn where users had difficulties finding what they were
looking for.

By understanding DTBE audiences and listening to their information needs,
assessing the usability of content, and applying best practices of responsive
design, CEBSB staff are working to ensure that users will more easily find the
information they are looking for on the DTBE website.

**World TB Day Media Recap**

![World TB Day Media Recap
](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_16/images/tbnotes-endtb.jpg)

The TB community came together on social media to raise awareness on World TB
Day. #EndTB and #WorldTBDay were both trending topics on Twitter.  The World
TB Day Thunderclap was a great success, with over 223 supporters sending the
"Unite to End TB" message to 1,575,843 people.  "World TB Day" was mentioned
36,791 times on Twitter alone. At CDC, 16 social media accounts across the
agency sent World TB Day messages through Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
Traditional media such as CNNExternal, Associated Press, Health DayExternal,
Washington PostExternal, Wall Street JournalExternal, and Huffington
PostExternal also published articles on World TB Day.   Stay tuned to TB Notes
for information on World TB Day 2017!

Data Management, Statistics, and Evaluation Branch (proposed) Updates

 **TB Involvement in the CDC National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis,
STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) Epidemiologic and Economic Modeling Agreement
(NEEMA)**

In fiscal year (FY) 2015, NCCHSTP began a project with Emory University, the
Harvard University Prevention Policy Modeling Lab, and the University of
California at San Francisco (UCSF) to model epidemiologic and economic
outcomes of HIV, hepatitis, STDs, and TB in all populations and of HIV/STDs in
school-age populations. The project is a 5-year cooperative agreement, with
grantees funded through annual awards; approximately $3.5 million was awarded
in FY15 and $4.7 million in FY16. It is hoped that NEEMA will be as useful and
productive to achieving TB elimination as are neem trees to producing wood,
shade, medicine, honey, insecticide, oil, animal feed, and fuel. Suzanne
Marks, MPH, MA, and Andrew Hill, PhD, represent DTBE in managing the TB
projects.

FY15 TB NEEMA projects focused on:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1.

Modeling of TB Transmission in the United States.

The first activity was conducted by UCSF. It resulted in a systematic
literature review of the TB testing cascade, including costs of each step, for
foreign-born populations. In FY16, they added populations with homelessness or
injecting-drug use.

For the second activity, UCSF developed models using California-specific data,
and Harvard updated a model focusing on TB targeted testing and treatment for
LTBI within populations at TB risk. The latter group also modeled the impact
of test types within populations having medical risks.

UCSF estimated time to TB elimination by population in California. They
collaborated with the California and San Francisco Departments of Public
Health and the Curry International Tuberculosis Center on modeling topics and
data inputs. Additionally, Harvard developed a U.S. model of TB transmission
that accounts for multiple risk factors and populations over time. In FY16,
Emory developed a model for each of the four states contributing most to U.S.
TB morbidity (California, New York, Texas, and Florida). They have engaged
collaborators from the respective states to assist.

In FY16, Harvard added modeling of international TB control efforts, and UCSF
added modeling of optimal strategies for TB testing and LTBI treatment among

TB NEEMA researchers presented five posters at the International Union against
TB and Lung Disease-North American Region/National Tuberculosis Controllers
Association 2016 TB Conference and will present three posters at the 2016
American Thoracic Society Conference. Several journal articles have already
been drafted.

On the horizon for development are online user interfaces that will enable TB
programs to enter their risk populations, diagnostic algorithms, treatment
regimens, and other location-specific data to obtain cost-effectiveness and
time to TB elimination estimates.

Laboratory Branch Updates

 **Drug-Susceptibility Testing Reference Center**

The laboratory plays a critical role in the diagnosis of TB and detection of
drug resistance. Performing drug-susceptibility testing (DST) for
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC) is technically demanding and
maintaining proficiency to perform testing and interpret results is critical
to ensuring accuracy. Public health laboratories (PHL) are an important
provider of TB DST services, but have a range of TB DST volumes with some
laboratories testing less than the currently recommended volume of at least 50
isolates/year for maintaining technical competency.

To address the need for TB DST in lower volume public health laboratories,
DTBE, in collaboration with the Association of Public Health Laboratories
(APHL), stood up a DST Reference Center for MTBC at the California Microbial
Diseases Laboratory (MDL) in March 2015. The primary purpose of the DST
Reference Center is to provide a resource for quality-assured first-line DST
for U.S. public health laboratories with low volumes of DST while also
providing additional access to molecular testing for rifampin and isoniazid
and second-line DST when needed. The reference center at MDL serves as an
extension of the CDC DTBE Laboratory Branch (LB) Reference Laboratory and
provides services that are complementary to those at CDC for low volume public
health laboratories.

As of February 2016, a total of 15 low to moderate volume public health
laboratories have enrolled for testing services through the DST Reference
Center.  The center has performed testing for 214 samples at no cost to the
submitting laboratory with the exception of shipping costs. The DST Reference
Center has achieved a mean turnaround time for results reporting of 18 days
for first-line drugs and 2 days for sequencing. When MDL detects rifampin
resistance, algorithms are in place to work collaboratively with the DTBE/LB
to ensure referral of isolates for the full panel of testing available through
the Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance (MDDR) service at CDC. Evaluation
of the service, including customer satisfaction, will be performed within the
next few months. Anecdotally, the service provided by MDL has been well
received. For additional information on enrollment eligibility, please contact
Anne Gaynor with APHL at 240-485-2739 or anne.gaynor@aphl.org.
