### What is African trypanosomiasis?

African trypanosomiasis, also called African sleeping sickness, is a parasitic
disease spread by the tsetse fly. Symptoms include fatigue, high fever,
headaches, and muscle aches. If the disease is not treated, it can cause
death.

### Who is at risk?

Travelers who go to sub-Saharan Africa are at risk (see map). Travelers who
plan to spend a lot of time outdoors or who go to game parks are at increased
risk.

### What can travelers do to prevent African trypanosomiasis?

![tsetse fly](/travel/images/tsetse-fly.jpg)

There is no vaccine or medicine that prevents African trypanosomiasis.
Travelers can protect themselves by preventing tsetse fly bites.

#### Prevent tsetse fly bites:
