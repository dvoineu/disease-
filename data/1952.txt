## Summary

Hormones are your body's chemical messengers. They travel in your bloodstream
to tissues or organs. They work slowly, over time, and affect many different
processes, including

    * Growth and development
    * Metabolism - how your body gets energy from the foods you eat
    * Sexual function
    * Reproduction
    * Mood

Endocrine glands, which are special groups of cells, make hormones. The major
endocrine glands are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, thyroid, adrenal glands,
and pancreas. In addition, men produce hormones in their testes and women
produce them in their ovaries.

Hormones are powerful. It takes only a tiny amount to cause big changes in
cells or even your whole body. That is why too much or too little of a certain
hormone can be serious. Laboratory tests can measure the hormone levels in
your blood, urine, or saliva. Your health care provider may perform these
tests if you have symptoms of a hormone disorder. Home pregnancy tests are
similar - they test for pregnancy hormones in your urine.
