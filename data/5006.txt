These two principal mechanisms of injury accounted for 52.3% and 20.4%, respectively, of all TBI-related hospitalizations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * From 2006 to 2014, age-adjusted rates of TBI-related hospitalizations decreased by nearly 8% (from 92.2 per 100,000 population to 84.9).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * This decrease coincides with a 34% decrease in the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related hospitalizations attributable to motor vehicle crashes (27.6 in 2006 to 18.1 in 2014).
