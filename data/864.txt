### Think about...

**Travel-related diseases** | **Transmission** | **Prevention modalities:
vaccination, medication, consultation**  
---|---|---  
**Hepatitis A** **** |

**Contaminated food & water**

|

**Vaccination** (2-dose vaccine): Recommended for most travelers.  
\--Administer 2 doses, at least 6 months apart.  
\--At least 1 dose should be given before travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to wash hands frequently and avoid unsafe
food and water.  
  
**Hepatitis B** **** | **Sexual contact, contaminated needles, & blood
products, vertical transmission** |

**Vaccination** (3-dose vaccine): Recommended for all non-immune travelers,
but especially those who are traveling to a country with hepatitis B
prevalence ≥2%.  
\--Administer doses at 0, 1, and 6 months.  
\--Accelerated schedule is available.

**Consultation** : Advise patient to practice safe sex and avoid contaminated
needles and blood products.  
  
**Typhoid** **** | **Contaminated food & water** | **Vaccination** (with oral
or injectable vaccines): Recommended for travelers going to a country that is
endemic for typhoid.  
\--Administer injectable vaccine at least 2 weeks before travel.  
\--Complete 4 doses of oral vaccine (taken 2 days apart) at least 10 days
before travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to wash hands frequently and avoid unsafe
food and water.  
  
**Rabies** **** | **Saliva of infected animals** | **Vaccination** (3-dose
vaccine): Consider offering vaccine to travelers to high-risk countries who:

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Plan to spend a lot of time outdoors or in high-risk environments (such as adventure travelers or cavers)
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Will be handling animals (such as veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologists, or laboratory workers working with animal specimens)
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Are children who may be at higher risk because they are more likely to approach animals and less likely to report bites
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Will be traveling to rural areas (because treatment might not be available)

\--Begin vaccine series at least 21 days before travel.  
\--Administer doses at 0, 7, and 21 days or 28 days.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to avoid contact with animals. The risk of
rabies is extremely small for travelers who know the risk, have a plan for
getting care if they are bitten, and have travel health insurance to pay for
treatment (and, potentially, evacuation to an area where treatment is
available).  
  
**Yellow fever** **** | **Mosquito bites** | **Vaccination** (Single-dose
vaccine): Recommended for travelers to certain parts of South America and
Africa.  
\--Administer at least 10 days before planned arrival (this is an
international country requirement).

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Find the nearest clinic for referrals. ****

**Consultation:** Advise patient to avoid mosquitoes. Patient should also be
advised to carry proof of vaccination (yellow card) when traveling to certain
destinations that require yellow fever vaccination for entry.  
  
**Japanese encephalitis** | **Mosquito bites** |

**Vaccination** (two-dose vaccine): Recommended for certain travelers to Asia
and the western Pacific, including long-term travelers (i.e., trips lasting
_>_ 1 month) to endemic areas during rainy season.

Consider for the following groups:

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Short-term (<1 month) travelers to endemic areas during Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season if their itinerary or activities will increase their risk (e.g., spending substantial time outdoors in rural or agricultural areas, or staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.)
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak of Japanese encephalitis.
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific activities or duration of travel.

\--Administer doses at 0 and 28 days.

\--Ideally, complete vaccine series at least 1 week before travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to avoid mosquitoes.  
  
**Cholera** | **Contaminated food & water** **** | **Vaccination:**
Recommended for adults who are traveling to areas of active cholera
transmission.  
\--Administer at least 10 days before travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to wash hands frequently and avoid unsafe
food and water.  
  
**Meningococcal** **disease** **** | **Person-to-person, oral and respiratory
secretions** | **Vaccination:** Recommended for travelers to areas in the
"meningitis belt" of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly during the dry season
(December through June), when the disease is more common.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Required_ for travelers to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. See Saudi Arabia: Hajj/Umrah Pilgrimage for more information.

\--Administer at least 10 days before travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to wash hands often and avoid touching face
and activities with risk of saliva exchange.  
  
**Malaria** | ** ** **Mosquito bites** | **Medication:** Consider malaria
prophylaxis for travelers to areas with malaria transmission, which include
parts of Africa, Latin America, parts of the Caribbean, South Asia, East Asia,
the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the South Pacific.  
\-- Choosing a medication for prophylaxis must take into account the
traveler's medical history and current medications, as well as malaria drug
resistance in the area(s) of travel.

**Consultation:** Advise patient to avoid mosquitoes. Advise pregnant women to
avoid travel to areas with malaria transmission if possible.  
  
*Travelers may also need routine (non-travel) vaccines or boosters before travel including influenza; measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); tetanus (Td or Tdap); varicella; pneumococcus; and polio. Check CDC's Destination Pages for country-specific vaccine recommendations.
