## Activity Count

Physical activity is any body movement that works your muscles and requires
more energy than resting. Walking, running, dancing, swimming, yoga, and
gardening are a few examples of physical activity.

## Aerobic Exercise

Aerobic exercise is activity that moves your large muscles, such as those in
your arms and legs. It makes you breathe harder and your heart beat faster.
Examples include running, swimming, walking, and biking. Over time, regular
aerobic activity makes your heart and lungs stronger and able to work better.

Basal metabolic rate is the measure of the energy necessary for maintaining
basic functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion.

## Body Mass Index

Body Mass Index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat. It is calculated from
your height and weight. It can tell you whether you are underweight, normal,
overweight, or obese. It can help you gauge your risk for diseases that can
occur with more body fat.

## Cool Down

Your physical activity session should end by gradually slowing down. You can
also cool down by changing to a less vigorous activity, such as moving from
jogging to walking. This process allows your body to relax gradually. A cool
down can last 5 minutes or more.

## Energy Balance

The balance between calories you get from eating and drinking and those you
use up through physical activity and body processes like breathing, digesting
food, and, in children, growing.

## Energy Consumed

Energy is another word for calories. What you eat and drink is "energy in."
What you burn through physical activity is "energy out."

## Flexibility (Training)

Flexibility training is exercise that stretches and lengthens your muscles. It
can help improve your joint flexibility and keep your muscles limber. This can
help prevent injuries. Some examples are yoga, tai chi, and pilates.

## Heart Rate

Heart rate, or pulse, is how many times your heart beats in a period of time
-- usually a minute. The usual pulse for an adult is 60 to 100 beats per
minute after resting for at least 10 minutes.

## Perspiration

Perspiration, or sweat, is a clear, salty liquid produced by glands in your
skin. It is how your body cools itself. Sweating a lot is normal when it is
hot or when you exercise, feel anxious, or have a fever. It can also happen
during menopause.

## Resistance/Strength Training

Resistance training, or strength training, is exercise that firms and tones
your muscles. It can improve your bone strength, balance, and coordination.
Some examples are pushups, lunges, and bicep curls using dumbbells.

## Target Heart Rate

Your target heart rate is a percentage of your maximum heart rate, which is
the fastest your heart can beat. It is based on your age. The activity level
that is best for your health uses 50â75 percent of your maximum heart rate.
This range is your target heart rate zone.

## Warm Up

Your physical activity session should start at a slow-to-medium pace to give
your body a chance to get ready for more vigorous movement. A warm up should
last about 5 to 10 minutes.

## Water Intake

We all need to drink water. How much you need depends on your size, activity
level, and the weather where you live. Keeping track of your water intake
helps make sure that you get enough. Your intake includes fluids that you
drink, and fluids you get from food.

units of pounds or kilograms.
