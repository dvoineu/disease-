The Lyme disease blood test looks for antibodies in the blood to the bacteria
that causes Lyme disease. The test is used to help diagnose Lyme disease.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.

A laboratory specialist looks for Lyme disease antibodies in the blood sample
using the ELISA test. If the ELISA test is positive, it must be confirmed with
another test called the Western blot test.

## How to Prepare for the Test

You do not need special steps to prepare for this test.

## How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.
Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing
or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

## Why the Test is Performed

The test is done to help confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease.

## Normal Results

A negative test result is normal. This means none or few antibodies to Lyme
disease were seen in your blood sample. If the ELISA test is negative, usually
no other testing is needed.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs
use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care
provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

A positive ELISA result is abnormal. This means antibodies were seen in your
blood sample. But, this does not confirm a diagnosis of Lyme disease. A
positive ELISA result must be followed up with a Western blot test. Only a
positive Western blot test can confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease.

For many people, the ELISA test remains positive, even after they have been
treated for Lyme disease and no longer have symptoms.

A positive ELISA test may also occur with certain diseases not related to Lyme
disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

## Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries
vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the
other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:

    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Multiple punctures to locate veins
    * Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
    * Excessive bleeding
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)

## Alternative Names

Lyme disease serology; ELISA for Lyme disease; Western blot for Lyme disease
