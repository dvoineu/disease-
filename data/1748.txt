Rat-bite fever (RBF) is an infectious disease caused by two different
bacteria:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * _Streptobacillus moniliformis_ , the only reported bacteria that causes RBF in North America (streptobacillary RBF)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * _Spirillum minus_ , common in Asia (spirillary RBF, also known as sodoku)

People typically become infected with these bacteria after contact with
rodents carrying the bacteria. A person can also get infected through
consumption of food or water contaminated with the urine and droppings of
rodents carrying the bacteria. This is known as Haverhill fever.

If not treated, RBF can be a serious or even fatal disease.
