This site provides information on the independent peer review of documents
defined by CDC as influential in terms of their potential impact on public
policy or the private sector. CDC makes this information available to
demonstrate its efforts to utilize only the most transparent and independent
peer review, appropriate research methods, and the highest level of data
quality. In addition, this information demonstrates CDC compliance with the
specific requirements of the Information Quality Act (2000), 44 U.S.C.
§3516external icon, and of peer review standards developed by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). OMB requirements,
described in the Peer Review Bulletinpdf icon, include making publicly
available specific information on the peer review of influential documents
disseminated by the federal government. OMB has defined two special categories
of influential information, Influential Scientific Information (ISI) and
Highly Influential Scientific Assessments (HISAs).
