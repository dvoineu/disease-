in the past year because of their asthma, and they were on drug therapy at
least 15 days each month. Patients who had chronic respiratory infections,
bronchitis, emphysema, multi-system disorders, and a history of chronic
smoking were excluded.

**Program Description:**  
The objective of this study was to assess the effect of asthma self-management
training (SMT) on the health status and medical care of patients who had
chronic asthma. The purpose of SMT is to maintain function, to slow
deterioration, and to minimize impact of the disease and its treatment on the
health status of the patients. A social scientist conducted intervention
sessions during the first month following the baseline interview. The patients
were given precise, written instructions about drug administration. Patients
were trained to adjust medications promptly and safely on the basis of their
severity and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Role models were used to help
the patients develop skills for minimizing antigen exposure. Using focus group
discussions and scenario descriptions, patients were trained to identify early
symptoms and to take remedial actions to control acute attacks.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study utilized an individually randomized control design. The two groups
were similar at baseline in terms of sex, age, health status, and health care
utilization in the month prior to the study. Both groups received usual
clinical care for asthma management (including bronchodilator and anti-
inflammatory drugs). The intervention group received SMT along with usual
care. Patients were monitored for 12 months. Health status data were recorded
daily for four one-month periods. The PEFR was used to assess disease
severity. The overall mean PEFR for each patient during the follow-up year was
used to measure health status. Health service data were used to acquire
information on emergency visits and hospitalizations.

**Sample Size:**  
The study initially included 153 patients enrolled in the intervention group
and 150 in the control group. A total of 276 patients, 140 in the intervention
group and 136 in the control group, completed the three follow-up periods.

**Outcome Measures and Results:**  
Outcome measures included daily asthma severity (as measured by PEFR), number
and duration of hospitalizations, number of emergency visits, and cost. The
intervention group's mean PEFR improved by 14.5% over the 12-month follow-up.
The intervention group had 48.5% fewer productive days lost and had 53.2%
fewer days hospitalized compared with the control group. The likelihood that
an intervention group participant would be hospitalized was reduced 26%. For
patients hospitalized, the average number of days hospitalized during the year
was 38 days for the control group and 22 days for the intervention group. The
intervention group had a 46.7% reduction in emergency visits overall. The
average total medical cost for the intervention group was 22% less than for
the control group.

### Community Asthma Care Education Centre (AEC) Program

**Article Citation:**  
Hopman WM, Owen JG, Gagne E. Assessment of the effect of asthma education on
outcomes. Managed Care Interface May 1999;89-93.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital in Ontario, Canada

The Oakville program is one of Canada's Community Asthma Care Centers (CACC)
whose objectives include decreasing hospital and ED utilization, assisting
patients in achieving the best possible control of their asthma symptoms,
eliminating duplication of services, supporting treatment prescribed by
referring physicians, and improving consistency of asthma management in the
community.

**Target Population:**  
Asthma patients of all ages referred by the emergency department (ED),
pediatricians, and family physicians were targeted for the study.

**Program Description:**  
The study objective was to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive
assessment, treatment, and education program for referred patients with
asthma. The program varied according to each patient's needs. At an initial
visit, standardized information was collected, and education and information
were provided on the basis of patient responses on topics including
medications, trigger avoidance, environmental control, self-monitoring skills,
delivery systems and techniques, and basic spirometry. After 2 weeks, patients
returned to the Asthma Education Centre for reassessment visits to build on
the assessment and educational topics and to determine additional needs.
Assessment visits continued until the patient's asthma was under control. A
personal action plan was developed, and the physician was contacted to provide
information on patient's condition, use of delivery devices, medications, and
dosage. The physician also reviewed the action plan for approval. Patients
were then seen at 3- and 6-month intervals.

**Evaluation Design:**  
The study utilized a pre-post-intervention design. Initial data on patient
history, symptoms, triggers, medications, environment, and actions taken
during an asthma episode were collected via a validated questionnaire used by
all CACCs. A one-year follow-up visit was used to collect post-intervention
data; a 24-month follow-up also was carried out for a subset of 113 patients.

**Sample Size:**  
In both the initial and a one-year follow-up visit, 121 patients were seen.
The patient population assessed by age cohorts: 43 patients were aged 0-5
years, (2) 47 were aged 6-16 years, and (3) 31 were aged greater than 16
years.

**Outcome Measures/Results:**  
Outcome measures included the number of nights awakened because of asthma-
related symptoms, school or workdays missed in the past four weeks, and the
number of ED visits and hospital admissions in the past 6 months (measured at
baseline and at 12 and 24 months). Results include a decrease in night
awakenings in the previous four weeks in all three age cohorts, a decrease in
emergency visits in the previous 6 months in all age cohorts, a decrease in
hospitalizations in the previous 6 months in all cohorts, and a decrease in
days missed from school or work in the two older age cohorts. Days of work or
school missed were not applicable to the youngest age cohort. All of these
differences were statistically significant. Specific outcome measures
comparing baseline (pre-) and 24-month follow-up (post-) are shown here:

Study Outcome Variable | Age 0-5 | Age 6-16 | Age >16  
---|---|---|---  
| pre- | post- | pre- | post- | pre- | post-  
Percent with no night awakenings last 4 weeks | 5% | 66% | 16% | 71% | 19% |
68%  
Mean number of emergency room visits last 6 months | 2.04 | 0.07 | 2.25 | 0.16
| 1.83 | 0.22  
Average number hospital admissions last 6 months | 0.48 | 0.04 | 0.23 | 0.04 |
0.38 | 0.03  
Average number of days of work/school missed, last 4 weeks | n/a | n/a | 2.58
| 0.16 | 2.36 | 0.26

### East London Controlled Trial for High Risk Asthma

**Article Citation(s):**  
Griffiths C, Foster G, Barnes N, Eldridge S, Tate H, Begum S, et al.
Specialist nurse intervention to reduce unscheduled asthma care in a deprived
multiethnic area: the east London randomised controlled trial for high risk
asthma (ELECTRA). Br Med J 2004;328(7432):144-7.

**Intervention Setting:**  
44 general practices in two boroughs of east London, United Kingdom

**Target Population:**  
People with acute asthma, aged 4-60 years, who sought emergency or after-hours
treatment.

**Program Description:**  
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had asthma diagnosed
by a doctor, and had been admitted to or attended the emergency department at
the Royal London Hospital or a general practitioner out-of-hours (after hours)
service for acute asthma. Intervention included patient review in a nurse-led
clinic and liaison with general practitioners and practice nurses comprising
educational outreach, promotion of guidelines for high-risk asthma, and
ongoing clinical support. Specifically, general practices randomized to the
intervention group received two 1-hour visits by the specialist nurses at the
start of the study to discuss guidelines for managing patients with acute
asthma. Specialist nurses at the nurse-run clinic reviewed participants
registered with the intervention practices for asthma control and drugs
immediately after recruitment. They discussed a self-management plan. Patients
with sufficient understanding received a peak flow meter and a written plan
containing standard thresholds for peak flow and symptoms. Practices
randomized to the control group received a single visit from the nurses to
discuss standard guidelines for asthma. Control practice participants were
checked for inhaler technique in the nurse-run clinic immediately after
recruitment. Drugs were unaltered and participants continued with usual care.

**Evaluation Design:**  
This was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization took place at the
general practice level to either intervention or control groups

**Sample Size:**  
324 individuals: 164 [51%] South Asian patients, 108 [33%] white patients, and
52 [16%] from other ethnicities, largely African and Afro-Caribbean. Only 45%
of participants spoke English; 89% lived in rented housing and 55% were
unemployed. Of the total, 63% were recruited prospectively after attendance
with acute asthma.

**Outcome Measures:**  
Percentage of participants receiving unscheduled care for acute asthma over 1
year and time to first unscheduled attendance

**Results:**  
The specialist nurse intervention delayed time to first attendance with acute
asthma (median of 194 days for the intervention group, 126 days median for the
control group). The intervention also reduced the percentage of participants
attending with acute asthma (58% for the intervention group, 68% for the
control group). The overall rates of yearly attendance for unscheduled care
for each participant were 1.98 for the intervention group and 2.36 for the
control group.

### The Canadian Multi-site Asthma Education Program

**Article Citation(s):**  
Hopman WM, Garvey N, Olajos-Clow J, White-Markham A, Lougheed MD. Outcomes of
asthma education: results of a multi-site evaluation. Can Respir J
2004;11(4):291-7.

**Intervention Setting:**  
Seven sites across Canada, including community asthma care centers (CACCs) in
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, two from Ontario, plus a
community hospital and an academic health sciences center in Ontario.

**Target Population:**  
This study involved teens and adults, 16 years of age and older, with
diagnosed asthma who were attending a participating asthma center or clinic.
All participants were referred by family physicians, specialists, or emergency
departments on the basis of poor asthma control or an exacerbation of asthma.

**Program Description:**  
This study sought to determine the effectiveness of a standardized asthma
education program, administered in a variety of settings, in improving a
number of outcomes, and the factors associated with a change in outcome. The
study hypothesis was that a standardized asthma education program would
improve outcomes regardless of geographical site or physical setting.

Referred patients attended an initial visit and a 6-month follow-up visit to
the education program. At the initial visit, spirometry was conducted and a
detailed patient profile was concluded using a standardized questionnaire and
software developed for this purpose. The questionnaire formed the basis of the
needs assessment and contained items relating to patient history, contacts
with the health care system, symptoms, triggers, medications, environment,
action plans, and action taken during an asthma episode. Health-related
quality of life was measured at baseline and again at a 6-month followup using
the self-administered Medical Outcomes Study. (The Medical Outcomes Study
36-item Short Form 1.0 [SF-36] has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid
for asthma. The SF-36 provides scores ranging from 0 [poor] to 100 [excellent]
on eight domains; higher scores represent better function and lower pain
levels).

The program was based on a model of education implemented in a large community
hospital that had previously demonstrated statistically significant
improvements in health outcomes. Trained asthma educators with a background in
nursing or respiratory therapy provided the education. The program was
standardized across the seven sites by means of a training workshop and the
use of questionnaires. The education program included three levels of
education available to the patient relative to their asthma severity and
initial needs assessment. The education is based on the social cognitive
theory of learning and behavior change. Curriculum content included trigger
avoidance, environmental control, the role of medications, delivery systems,
action plans, and self-monitoring skills. The education took about 2 hours to
complete. A follow-up visit was scheduled for 2 weeks later to assess control
and understanding and the instructional material was reviewed as necessary. A
follow-up visit was scheduled for 6 months after the baseline visit, at which
time the patients responded to a second standardized questionnaire that
referenced the previous 6 months and assessed contact with the health care
system, symptoms, triggers, medication, action plan use, and action taken
during an episode.

**Evaluation Design:**  
An uncontrolled, prospective, observational, comparative study with a pre-post
design

**Sample Size:**  
The final sample comprised 252 adults. The patients were predominantly middle-
aged (mean average 42.0 years), with a long-standing history of asthma; 75%
were female.

**Outcome Measures:**  
Health care use (regular and unscheduled visits to general physicians and
specialists, number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and length
of stay), absenteeism, amount of leisure time missed, and health-related
quality of life in a variety of settings.

**Results:**  
Statistically significant improvements resulted in all health care use and
absenteeism outcomes, except regular specialist visits. The following mean
values are based on total number of visits or admissions divided by the sample
size. Unscheduled physician visits fell from an average of 2.71 to 0.51.
Unscheduled specialist visits fell from 0.14 to 0.06. The mean number of
hospital admissions at baseline was 0.48; at followup this number had dropped
to 0.13. The mean number of days in the hospital for the 63 patients admitted
was 1.72 at baseline compared to 0.92 at follow-up. Mean number of emergency
room visits fell over the same time from 0.95 to 0.27. The mean number of
missed work or school days also fell, from 5.04 to 3.65. Finally, missed
leisure time days fell from 2.14 to 1.81. Six months after asthma education,
statistically significant improvements in all health-related quality of life
domains had resulted, except for mental health. The change upward in five
domains (physical function, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, and
vitality) exceeded 5 points. The developers considered that to be a clinically
and socially meaningful change. The change in social function and general
health fell just short of 5 points.
