## Summary

Each spring, summer, and fall, trees, weeds, and grasses release tiny pollen
grains into the air. Some of the pollen ends up in your nose and throat. This
can trigger a type of allergy called hay fever.

Symptoms can include

    * Sneezing, often with a runny or clogged nose
    * Coughing and postnasal drip
    * Itching eyes, nose and throat
    * Red and watery eyes
    * Dark circles under the eyes

Your health care provider may diagnose hay fever based on a physical exam and
your symptoms. Sometimes skin or blood tests are used. Taking medicines and
using nasal sprays can relieve symptoms. You can also rinse out your nose, but
be sure to use distilled or sterilized water with saline. Allergy shots can
help make you less sensitive to pollen and provide long-term relief.
