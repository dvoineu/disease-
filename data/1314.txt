Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer

While overall cancer death rates continue to decline, trends from 2012 to 2016
show incidence rates (rates of getting cancer) are leveling off among men and
increasing slightly for women. The incidence rate for all cancer sites
combined was 448 cases per 100,000 people in the United States.

Men

Among men, rates of new cancers decreased for 5 of the 17 most common cancers,
increased for 5 cancers, and were stable for 7 cancers. Rates of new cancers
were stable only among white men and decreased among black, Asian/ Pacific
Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic men.

Women

Among women, rates of new cancers decreased for 4 of the 18 most common
cancers, increased for 8 cancers, and were stable for 6 cancers.
