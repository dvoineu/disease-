How to end HIV transmission in the United States

pdf iconView Transcript media iconLow Resolution Video

## Overview

About 38,000 new HIV infections still occur each year. The US Government
recently proposed **_Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan_ for America** to reduce
HIV transmission. The goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030. To
end transmissions, people should first get tested for HIV so everyone knows
whether or not they have it. People with HIV should take HIV medicine every
day to control the virus, stay healthy, and have effectively no risk of sexual
transmission. People without HIV, but at high risk for it, can take a medicine
called PrEP to prevent them from getting HIV from sex when taken as
prescribed.

* HIV that is under control or undetectable has less than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood.  
† Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP, is an oral pill for people at very high
risk for getting HIV. When used as prescribed, PrEP can prevent HIV.

### Key actions to help end the HIV epidemic§

![Key actions to help end the HIV epidemic*; TEST FOR HIV: HIV tests determine
the next prevention step, PrEP or HIV treatment. 86 percent of people with HIV
know they have it. TARGET: 95 percent. PREVENT: People without HIV, but at
risk for it, can take PrEP as prescribed to prevent getting HIV. 18 percent of
those who could benefit from PrEP have a prescription for it. TARGET 50
percent. TREAT: People who know they have HIV should take medicine daily to
control the virus. 63 percent have the virus under control. TARGET 95 percent.

Problem

#####  **Progress has Stalled:**

                    * In 2017, too few people with HIV, especially those ages 13-24 years, got the HIV medical care or medicine they need every day to control the virus.
                    * Many infections (about 4 of 10) came from people who didn't know they had HIV in 2016.
                    * Another 6 in 10 infections in 2016 came from people who knew they had HIV, but were not getting HIV medical care or taking medicine consistently to control the virus.
                    * PrEP wasn't prescribed to enough of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from it in 2018, especially young people and racial/ethnic minorities. PrEP coverage for whites is 4 to 7 times as high as for Latinos and blacks.

The Way Forward

#####  **Healthcare Providers Can:**

                    * Test all patients for HIV at least once in their lives.
                    * Test people at high risk for HIV at least once a year. Gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (every 3 to 6 months).
                    * Initiate HIV treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis.
                    * Prescribe PrEP to all patients who could benefit from it. Learn more at https://bit.ly/PrEPrx.

##### **Health Departments Can:**

                    * Expand HIV testing including use of self-test kits.
                    * Find people who fall out of HIV care, and help them get back in care.
                    * Raise awareness about PrEP and train health care providers in how and when to prescribe it.

##### **Everyone Can:**

                    * Get tested for HIV. Find where you can get tested at http://bit.ly/HIVtestnearby.
                    * Talk with your healthcare provider about HIV prevention including PrEP.
                    * Stay healthy by taking your medicine as prescribed if you have HIV or are on PrEP.

Test, Treat, Prevent, and Respond

![A group of smiling people.](/vitalsigns/test-treat-prevent/images/vs-test-

 _ **Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America**_ would leverage critical
scientific advances in HIV testing, treatment, prevention, and response, by
coordinating highly successful programs and resources of the US Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies and offices. **_Ending the HIV_
Epidemic** would first focus on geographic areas that are hardest hit by HIV
to achieve the most impact. The intent is to expand nationally within 10
years.
