### Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)

Studies support the safety of annual IIV vaccination in children and adults.
IIV is administered as an injection and may cause pain, redness, and swelling
at the injection site, and may also cause fever, malaise and myalgias, which
are usually mild and go away on their own. IIV contains inactivated virus and
cannot cause influenza.

Flu vaccine composition often changes year-to-year, and CDC and FDA will continue to closely monitor the safety of influenza vaccines each season.

Health care providers should consult the package insertsexternal icon for vaccine components.

Recommendations for vaccinating patients who are allergic to eggs are
available. RIV is approved in individuals aged 18 years and older, and people
in this age group who are allergic to eggs may receive RIV. If RIV is not
available or the recipient is not 18 years or older, most egg-allergic
patients can safely receive IIV. Those who have only experienced hives as a
reaction to egg may receive IIV, with some additional safety precautions.
Individuals with a history of severe (life threatening) allergy to eating eggs
may receive IIV if it is administered by a physician experienced in the
recognition and management of severe allergic conditions.

Precautions

In general, vaccinations should be deferred when a precaution is present.
However, a health care provider may determine that vaccination is indicated in
the presence of a precaution because the benefit of protection from the
vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction. The following are
precautions for IIV:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * GBS within 6 weeks of a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV)

No influenza vaccines are approved for use in infants aged <6 months.

Providers should consult the ACIP General Recommendations regarding other
steps to take that may help prevent adverse events after IIV vaccination.

### Cell Culture-based Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (ccIIV3)

Flucelvax (ccIIV3) is the first U.S.-licensed (trivalent inactivated)
influenza vaccine manufactured using cell culture technology. It is indicated
for use in individuals 18 years of age and older. ccIIV3 is administered as an
injection and may cause pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, and
may also cause fever, malaise and myalgias which are usually mild and self-
limited. ccIIV3 cannot cause influenza.

Adverse Events

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * The most common (≥10%) local and systemic reactions in adults 18-64 years of age were injection site pain (28%), injection site erythema (13%), headache (16%), fatigue (12%), muscle pain (11%) and malaise (10%).

Contraindications

ccIIV3 should not be administered to the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Individuals who have had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine or after previous dose of any influenza vaccine.

Precautions

In general, vaccinations should be deferred when a precaution is present.
However, a healthcare provider may determine that vaccination is indicated in
the presence of a precaution because the benefit of protection from the
vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction. The following are
precautions for ccIIV3:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever.

### Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV)

FluBlok (RIV) is a recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine available as a
trivalent formulation. RIV does not contain any egg protein.  RIV is indicated
for active immunization against disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A
and type B and is approved for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.
RIV is administered as an injection and may cause pain, redness, and swelling
at the injection site, and may also cause fever, malaise and myalgias which
are usually mild and self-limited. RIV cannot cause influenza.

Precautions

In general, vaccinations should be deferred when a precaution is present.
However, a healthcare provider may determine that vaccination is indicated in
the presence of a precaution because the benefit of protection from the
vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction. The following are
precautions for RIV:

### Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV)

FluMist (LAIV) is administered as an intranasal vaccine. LAIV vaccine is a
quadrivalent vaccine (protects against four types of flu viruses). It is
indicated for use in individuals 2 to 49 years of age. LAIV contains
attenuated viruses and cannot cause influenza.

Adverse Events

Studies support the safety of LAIV. In clinical trialsexternal icon,
quadrivalent LAIV had a safety profile similar to the previously used
trivalent LAIV, with the exception of slightly more reports of fever after the
first dose of quadrivalent LAIV compared to trivalent LAIV. This occurred in a
subset of children 2 years through 8 years of age who were getting vaccinated
for the first time. Rhinitis (runny nose) and nasal congestion pdf icon[1.1

### The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program
that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain
vaccines.

Individuals who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn
about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or
visiting the VICP websiteexternal icon. There is a time limit to file a claim
for compensation.

### Special Consideration Regarding Egg Allergy

People with egg allergies can receive any licensed, recommended age-
appropriate influenza (flu) vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise
appropriate.  People who have a history of severe egg allergy (those who have
had any symptom other than hives after exposure to egg) should be vaccinated
in a medical setting, supervised by a health care provider who is able to
recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.
