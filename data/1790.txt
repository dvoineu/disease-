## Summary

Most people feel sad or irritable from time to time. They may say they're in a
bad mood. A mood disorder is different. It affects a person's everyday
emotional state. Nearly one in ten people aged 18 and older have mood
disorders. These include depression and bipolar disorder (also called manic
depression).

Mood disorders can increase a person's risk for heart disease, diabetes, and
other diseases. Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, or a combination
of both. With treatment, most people with mood disorders can lead productive
lives.
