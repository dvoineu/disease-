## Summary

For many people, laser eye surgery can correct their vision so they no longer
need glasses or contact lenses. Laser eye surgery reshapes the cornea, the
clear front part of the eye. This changes its focusing power.

There are different types of laser eye surgery. LASIK - laser-assisted in situ
keratomileusis - is one of the most common. Many patients who have LASIK end
up with 20/20 vision. But, like all medical procedures, it has both risks and
benefits. Only your eye doctor can tell if you are a good candidate for laser
eye surgery.
