## Summary

Your paranasal sinuses are small hollow spaces around the nose. They are lined
with cells that make mucus, which keeps your nose from drying out. The nasal
cavity is the passageway just behind your nose. Air passes through it on the
way to your throat as you breathe.

Cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is rare. You are at greater
risk if you are

    * Male and over 40 years old
    * Exposed to certain workplace chemicals
    * Infected with HPV
    * A smoker

There may be no symptoms at first, and later symptoms can be like those of
infections. Doctors diagnose nasal cancer with imaging tests, lighted tube-
like instruments that look inside the nose, and biopsies. Treatment options
include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
