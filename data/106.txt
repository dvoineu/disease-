## Summary

People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many older adults live
active and healthy lives. But there's no getting around one thing: as we age,
our bodies and minds change. You need to know what to expect. Some changes may
just be part of normal aging, while others may be a warning sign of a medical
problem. It is important to know the difference, and to let your health care
provider know if you have any concerns.

Having a healthy lifestyle can help you to deal with normal aging changes and
make the most of your life.
