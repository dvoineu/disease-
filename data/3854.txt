The Road  
Ahead

**Over the course of five years of GHSA, all 17 CDC-supported countries have
improved their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
threats.**

All 17 GHSA countries have increased capacities in at least one indicator in
each technical area compared with baseline estimates. Fifteen countries have
increased capacities in four or more technical areas compared with the
baseline.

## Key Achievements in Five Years of GHSA

Respond: CDC supported Achievements in 17 Phase 1 Countries | **Laboratory
Systems** | **Surveillance Systems** | **Workforce Development** | **Emergency
Management and Response**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**chart icon  
Result ** | **11** countries demonstrated successful detection and reporting
of antimicrobial resistant pathogens in the last 12 months



**10** countries can conduct laboratory tests to detect national priority
pathogens that cause disease, outbreaks, or death



| **10** countries can connect disease surveillance data with laboratory data



**6** countries have established event-based surveillance in communities and
health care facilities

| **All 17** countries established or expanded their program to train disease
detectives



**14** countries have two levels of Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP)
or comparable programs available to public health staff

| **All** **17** countries have a Public Health Emergency Operations Center
(PHEOC), and each country has sent personnel to be trained at CDC's Public
Health Emergency Management (PHEM) Fellowship course



**9** of these PHEOCs can activate for a response within 120 minutes of
identification of a new public health emergency  
  
**lightbulb icon  
Why it Matters** | Confirming a diagnosis with laboratory results allows
health workers to respond rapidly with the most effective treatment and
prevention methods, reducing spread of disease and deaths | Effective disease
surveillance along with rapid laboratory diagnosis enables countries to
quickly detect and stop outbreaks and continuously respond to potential risks
| To maintain global health security capabilities, countries need a disease
detective workforce that can quickly investigate potential outbreaks and take
swift action | PHEOCs bring together experts and stakeholders to efficiently
and effectively coordinate response to an emergency or public health threat  
  
## Stories of Foundational Improvements in Global Health Security

Laboratory Systems: Motorcycles Help Speed Diagnosis in Liberia

![riders for health](/globalhealth/security/ghsa5year/images/ghsa-
laboratorysystems_ridersforhealth-medium.jpg)

Before the West Africa Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic, Liberia had no
system in place for getting clinical samples from remote areas to diagnostic
labs - a journey that could take as many as eight hours on public
transportation or over difficult terrain. Through Riders for Health,
motorcycle couriers offered Liberia an innovative solution for safely getting
samples from local clinics to diagnostic labs. With support from the CDC
Foundation, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the World
Health Organization, and CDC, riders were trained in infection prevention and
control, and in motorcycle safety and maintenance. Before Riders for Health,
only 25% of samples in Liberia reached a laboratory within 24 hours. Today,
that number has increased to about 80%.

 **Laboratory**  
_" Strong laboratory networks are one of the keys to global health security.
Continued investment in laboratory systems that can detect priority pathogens
allows for life-saving, rapid response."  _

Laboratories

Surveillance Systems: Detecting Multidrug-Resistance in Pakistan

In 2015, Pakistan was experiencing an outbreak from an unknown pathogen. CDC
identified _Candida auris_ , a life-threatening, multidrug-resistant fungus,
as the cause and quickly alerted Pakistan health authorities about the threat.
CDC worked with the Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH) to implement a
pilot program of laboratory-based surveillance for _C. auris_ , providing on-
site training to pilot hospitals and the NIH on identifying infections and
determining whether they are resistant to treatment. With CDC support, pilot
hospitals have begun reporting suspected cases and sending samples to Pakistan
NIH for testing. Pakistan's NIH Microbiology and Field Epidemiology & Disease
Surveillance Division monitored reported cases to stop outbreaks faster.
Pakistan plans to increase the number of surveillance sites once the pilot
program is complete. More robust identification and surveillance will help
contain the spread of _C. auris_ , particularly the most drug-resistant
strains, many of which have been found in Pakistan.

**Surveillance**  
_" Partnerships and investment in surveillance networks are critical to
preventing, detecting and responding to the next disease threat."_

Workforce Development: Informing Decision-Makers in Vietnam

![vietnam mosquitos](/globalhealth/security/ghsa5year/images/ghsa-
workforce_vietnam-mosquitos-medium.jpg)

From March to April 2019, surveillance staff at the Tay Nguyen Institute of
Hygiene and Epidemiology (TIHE) in Vietnam's Central Highlands noted increased
dengue cases in Gia Lai province. A recently trained FETP fellow and member of
the TIHE surveillance team joined the Gia Lai provincial rapid response team
to investigate the dengue outbreak. By applying what she learned in the FETP
training, the recent FETP fellow was able to collect essential data and
conduct data analysis related to the dengue outbreak. Through Vietnam's newly
established network of EOCs - developed in part with the support of CDC- the
surveillance team could compile, analyze, and interpret the data while working
within TIHE's EOC. Workforce development, as exemplified by FETP training,
along with Vietnam's newly established public health infrastructure and data
sharing, continue to help inform public health decision makers and guide the
country's response to disease outbreaks.

 **Workforce**  
_" Sustained investment in frontline health workforce teams is foundational to
global health security. Highly-trained and well-supported epidemiologists,
nurses, midwives, community health workers, physicians, pharmacists,
veterinarians and other frontline disease detectives must coordinate and
collaborate to rapidly prevent, detect and respond to emerging and re-emerging
health threats_."  
- Vince Blaser, Director, Frontline Health Workers Coalition Secretariat, IntraHealth International

Emergency Management and Response: Controlling Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
(CCHF) in Uganda

In a part of the world already fighting to contain EVD, CCHF may be initially
misidentified as EVD, highlighting the need for effective surveillance and
laboratory testing to correctly diagnose and contain the infectious pathogen
before it spreads. In Uganda, when an alert of suspected CCHF cases in two
regions was received, CDC-trained scientists at the Uganda Virus Research
Institute (UVRI) National Reference Laboratory confirmed CCHF through
molecular diagnostics within 24 hours. In each instance, health facilities
were able to use national surveillance and reporting systems to immediately
report the cases to Uganda's PHEOC, which in turn quickly mobilized national
rapid responders to collect samples and provide technical assistance to
healthcare workers. As a result of U.S. Government investments in the Ministry
of Health's infection prevention and control activities and viral hemorrhagic
fever diagnostics, Uganda has developed the ability to rapidly act to contain
deadly outbreaks, including that of CCHF and EVD.

 **Emergency Operations/Preparedness**  
" _Functional, exercised emergency operations capacity is a critical component
of global health security. CDC 's critical support to countries around the
world has enabled improved preparedness for biological events, whether
naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental, which threaten public health
and international security."_  
- Beth Cameron, Vice President, Nuclear Threat Initiative
