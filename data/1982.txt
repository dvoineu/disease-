## Summary

Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some
types of cell damage. Antioxidants are found in many foods, including fruits
and vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. Examples of
antioxidants include

    * Beta-carotene 
    * Lutein 
    * Lycopene
    * Selenium
    * Vitamin A
    * Vitamin C
    * Vitamin E

Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence
that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers
risks of certain diseases. But it isn't clear whether this is because of the
antioxidants, something else in the foods, or other factors.

High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some
cases. For example, high doses of beta-carotene may increase the risk of lung
cancer in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate
cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with
some medicines. To minimize risk, tell you of your health care providers about
any antioxidants you use.
