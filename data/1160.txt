What is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)?

The YRBSS was developed in 1990 to monitor health behaviors that contribute
markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among
youth and adults in the United States. These behaviors, often established
during childhood and early adolescence, include

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence.

In addition, the YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other
health-related behaviors plus sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts.

From 1991 through 2017, the YRBSS has collected data from more than 4.4
million high school students in more than 1,900 separate surveys.

What are the purposes of the YRBSS?

The YRBSS was designed to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Determine the prevalence of health behaviors.

What are the components of the YRBSS?

The YRBSS includes national, state, territorial, tribal government, and local
school-based surveys of representative samples of 9th through 12th grade
students. These surveys are conducted every two years, usually during the
spring semester. The national survey, conducted by CDC, provides data
representative of 9th through 12th grade students in public and private
schools in the United States. The state, territorial, tribal government, and
local surveys, conducted by departments of health and education, provide data
representative of mostly public high school students in each jurisdiction.

The YRBSS also includes additional surveys conducted by CDC:
