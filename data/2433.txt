You have been diagnosed with bacterial prostatitis. This is an infection of
the prostate gland.

## What to Expect

If you have acute prostatitis, your symptoms started quickly. You may still
feel ill, with fever, chills, and flushing (skin redness). It may hurt a lot
when you urinate for the first few days. The fever and pain should begin
improving over the first 36 hours.

If you have chronic prostatitis, your symptoms are likely to begin slowly and
be less severe. Symptoms will probably improve slowly over many weeks.

## Taking Your Antibiotics

It is likely you will have antibiotics to take home. Follow the directions on
the bottle carefully. Take the antibiotics at the same time every day.

For acute prostatitis, antibiotics are taken for 2 to 6 weeks. Chronic
prostatitis may be treated with antibiotics for 4 to 8 weeks if an infection
is found.

Finish all the antibiotics, even if you start feeling better. It is harder for
antibiotics to get into prostate tissue to treat the infection. Taking all of
your antibiotics will reduce the chance of the condition returning.

Antibiotics may cause side effects. These include nausea or vomiting,
diarrhea, and other symptoms. Report these to your doctor. DO NOT just stop
taking your pills.

## Help With Your Symptoms

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen,
may help with pain or discomfort. Ask your doctor if you can take these.

Warm baths may relieve some of your perineal and lower back pain.

Avoid substances that irritate the bladder, such as alcohol, caffeinated
beverages, citrus juices, and acidic or spicy foods.

Drink plenty of fluids, 64 or more ounces (2 or more liters) per day, if your
doctor says this is OK. This helps flush bacteria from the bladder. It can
also help prevent constipation.

To reduce discomfort with bowel movements, you may also:

    * Get some exercise every day. Start slowly and build up at least 30 minutes a day.
    * Eat foods with high fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables.
    * Try stool softeners or fiber supplements. 

## Follow-up

See your health care provider for an exam after you finish taking antibiotics
to make sure that the infection is gone.

If you do not improve or you are having problems with your treatment, talk to
your doctor sooner.

## When to Call the Doctor

Call your provider if:

    * You are unable to pass urine at all, or it is very difficult to pass urine.
    * Fever, chills, or pain do not begin to improve after 36 hours, or they are getting worse.
