# Leptospirosis

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is
caused by bacteria of the genus  _Leptospira_. In humans, it can cause a wide
range of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases. Some
infected persons, however, may have no symptoms at all.

Without treatment, Leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis
(inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver
failure, respiratory distress, and even death.
