## Summary

Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has
many benefits, including improving your overall health and fitness, and
reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. There are many different types
of exercise; it is important that you pick the right types for you. Most
people benefit from a combination of them:

    * **Endurance, or aerobic,** activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and biking.
    * **Strength, or resistance training,** exercises make your muscles stronger. Some examples are lifting weights and using a resistance band.
    * **Balance** exercises can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls. To improve your balance, try tai chi or exercises like standing on one leg.
    * **Flexibility** exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make you more flexible.

Fitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first.
But you can start slowly, and break your exercise time into chunks. Even doing
ten minutes at a time is fine. You can work your way up to doing the
recommended amount of exercise. How much exercise you need depends on your age
and health.

Other things that you can do to make the most of your workouts include

    * Choosing activities that work all the different parts of the body, including your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Good core strength improves balance and stability and helps to prevent lower back injury.
    * Choosing activities that you enjoy. It's easier to make exercise a regular part of your life if you have fun doing it.
    * Exercising safely, with proper equipment, to prevent injuries. Also, listen to your body and don't overdo it.
    * Giving yourself goals. The goals should challenge you, but also be realistic. It's also helpful to reward yourself when you reach your goals. The rewards could be something big, like new workout gear, or something smaller, such as movie tickets.
