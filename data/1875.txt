## Summary

Your elbow joint is made up of bone, cartilage, ligaments and fluid. Muscles
and tendons help the elbow joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or
diseased, you have elbow problems.

Many things can make your elbow hurt. A common cause is tendinitis, an
inflammation or injury to the tendons that attach muscle to bone. Tendinitis
of the elbow is a sports injury, often from playing tennis or golf. You may
also get tendinitis from overuse of the elbow.

Other causes of elbow pain include sprains and strains, fractures (broken
bones), dislocations, bursitis, and arthritis. Treatment depends on the cause.
