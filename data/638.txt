## Summary

Tetanus is a serious illness caused by Clostridium bacteria. The bacteria live
in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a
deep cut, like those you might get from stepping on a nail, or through a burn.

The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the
body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw. This makes it impossible to open
your mouth or swallow. Tetanus is a medical emergency. You need to get
treatment in a hospital.

A vaccine can prevent tetanus. It is given as a part of routine childhood
immunization. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If
you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor - you may need a booster. Immediate
and proper wound care can prevent tetanus infection.
