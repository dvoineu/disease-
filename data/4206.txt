Krabbe disease is a rare genetic disorder of the nervous system. It is a type
of brain disease called leukodystrophy.

## Causes

A defect in the _GALC_ gene causes Krabbe disease. People with this gene
defect do not make enough of a substance (enzyme) called galactocerebroside
beta-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase).

The body needs this enzyme to make myelin. Myelin surrounds and protects nerve
fibers. Without this enzyme, myelin breaks down, brain cells die, and nerves
in the brain and other body areas do not work properly.

Krabbe disease can develop at various ages:

    * Early-onset Krabbe disease appears in the first months of life. Most children with this form of the disease die before they reach age 2.
    * Late-onset Krabbe disease begins in late childhood or early adolescence. 

Krabbe disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families.
If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this
condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the
disease. It is an autosomal recessive disorder.

This condition is very rare. It is most common among people of Scandinavian
descent.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of early-onset Krabbe disease are:

    * Changing muscle tone from floppy to rigid
    * Hearing loss that leads to deafness
    * Failure to thrive
    * Feeding difficulties
    * Irritability and sensitivity to loud sounds
    * Severe seizures (may begin at a very early age)
    * Unexplained fevers
    * Vision loss that leads to blindness
    * Vomiting 

With late onset Krabbe disease, vision problems may appear first, followed by
walking difficulties and rigid muscles. Symptoms vary from person to person.
Other symptoms may also occur.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the
symptoms.

Tests that may be done include:

    * Blood test to look for galactosylceramidase levels in white blood cells
    * CSF total protein \-- tests the amount of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
    * Genetic testing for the GALC gene defect
    * MRI of the head
    * Nerve conduction velocity

## Treatment

There is no specific treatment for Krabbe disease.

Some people have had a bone marrow transplant in the early stages of the
disease, but this treatment has risks.

## Support Groups

These resources can provide more information about Krabbe disease:

    * National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/leukodystrophy-krabbes
    * NIH Genetics Home Reference -- ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/krabbe-disease
    * United Leukodystrophy Foundation -- www.ulf.org

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome is likely to be poor. On average, infants with early-onset Krabbe
disease die before age 2. People who develop the disease at a later age have
survived into adulthood with nervous system disease.

## Possible Complications

This disease damages the central nervous system. It can cause:

    * Blindness
    * Deafness
    * Severe problems with muscle tone 

The disease is usually life-threatening.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder. Go to
the hospital emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 911)
if the following symptoms occur:

    * Seizures
    * Loss of consciousness
    * Abnormal posturing

## Prevention

Genetic counseling is recommended for people with a family history of Krabbe
disease who are considering having children.

A blood test can be done to see if you carry the gene for Krabbe disease.

Prenatal tests (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) can be done to
test a developing baby for this condition.

## Alternative Names

Globoid cell leukodystrophy; Galactosylcerebrosidase deficiency;
Galactosylceramidase deficiency
