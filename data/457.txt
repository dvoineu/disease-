## Summary

Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune
system.

In adults, the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish,
shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts, such as walnuts. Problem foods for children
can include eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat.

The allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe
reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy include

    * Itching or swelling in your mouth
    * Vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramps and pain
    * Hives or eczema
    * Tightening of the throat and trouble breathing
    * Drop in blood pressure

Your health care provider may use a detailed history, elimination diet, and
skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.

When you have food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental
exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace, and carry an auto-
injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).

You can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After
you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are
sensitive, you must remove them from your diet.
