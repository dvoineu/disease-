# Abdominal thrusts

Choking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a
toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway).

A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the
lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes.
Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.

Abdominal thrusts is an emergency technique to help clear someone's airway.

      * The procedure is done on someone who is choking and also conscious.
      * Most experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old.
      * You can also perform the maneuver yourself.

## First Aid

First ask, "Are you choking? Can you speak?" DO NOT perform first aid if the
person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can often
dislodge the object.

If the person is choking, perform abdominal thrusts as follows:

      * If the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind the person and reach your arms around his or her waist. For a child, you may have to kneel.
      * Place your fist, thumb side in, just above the person's navel (belly button).
      * Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand.
      * Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist.
      * If the person is lying on his or her back, straddle the person facing the head. Push your grasped fist upward and inward in a movement similar to the one above. 

You may need to repeat the procedure several times before the object is
dislodged. If repeated attempts do not free the airway, call **911**.

If the person loses consciousness, start CPR.

If you are not comfortable performing abdominal thrusts, you can perform back
blows instead on a person who is choking.
