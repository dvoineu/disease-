## Summary

Preparing for a disaster can reduce the fear, anxiety and losses that
disasters cause. A disaster can be a natural disaster, like a hurricane,
tornado, flood or earthquake. It might also be man-made, like a bioterrorist
attack or chemical spill. You should know the risks and danger signs of
different types of disasters. You should also have a disaster plan. Be ready
to evacuate your home, and know how to treat basic medical problems. Make sure
you have the insurance you need, including special types, like flood
insurance.

No matter what kind of disaster you experience, it causes emotional distress.
After a disaster, recovery can take time. Stay connected to your family and
friends during this period.
