CDC's **National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH)** plans, directs, and
coordinates a program to protect the American people from environmental
hazards. We promote a healthy environment and prevent premature death,
avoidable illness and disability caused by non-infectious, non-occupational
environmental and related factors. We are especially committed to safeguarding
the health of vulnerable populations - such as children, the elderly, and
people with disabilities - from certain environmental hazards.
