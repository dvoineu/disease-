## Summary

Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging. However, some people have
more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called
mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves
and do their normal activities.

MCI memory problems may include

  * Losing things often
  * Forgetting to go to events and appointments
  * Having more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same age

Memory problems can also have other causes, including certain medicines and
diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the
problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed.

Your health care provider can do thinking, memory, and language tests to see
if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because
MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, it's really important to see
your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.

At this time, there is no proven drug treatment for MCI. Your health care
provider can check to see if you have any changes in your memory or thinking
skills over time.
