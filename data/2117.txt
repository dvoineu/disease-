## Summary

You can help prevent medical errors by being an active member of your health
care team. Research shows that patients who are more involved with their care
tend to get better results. To reduce the risk of medical errors, you can

    * Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. Take a relative or friend to your doctor appointment to help you ask questions and understand answers.
    * Make sure you understand what will happen if you need surgery
    * Tell your health care providers about all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements. Tell them if you have any allergies or bad reactions to anesthesia. Make sure you know how to take your medications correctly. 
    * Get a second opinion about treatment options
    * Keep a copy of your own medical history
