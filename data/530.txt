## Summary

Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If
a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths, that's
also called infertility.

Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex, about
15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time,
infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases, it is
because of the man. The rest of the time, it is because of both partners or no
cause can be found.

There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve
both partners. Drugs, assisted reproductive technology, and surgery are common
treatments. Happily, many couples treated for infertility go on to have
babies.
