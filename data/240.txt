## Summary

Blood thinners are medicines that prevent blood clots from forming. They also
keep existing blood clots from getting larger. Clots in your arteries, veins,
and heart can cause heart attacks, strokes, and blockages. You may take a
blood thinner if you have

  * Certain heart or blood vessel diseases
  * An abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation
  * A heart valve replacement
  * A risk of blood clots after surgery
  * Congenital heart defects

There are two main types of blood thinners. Anticoagulants such as heparin or
warfarin (also called Coumadin) slow down your body's process of making clots.
Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, prevent blood cells called platelets from
clumping together to form a clot.

When you take a blood thinner, follow directions carefully. Blood thinners may
interact with certain foods, medicines, vitamins, and alcohol. Make sure that
your health care provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are
using. You will probably need regular blood tests to check how well your blood
is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine
to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.
