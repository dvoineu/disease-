Otitis is a term for infection or inflammation of the ear.

## Causes

Otitis can affect the inner or outer parts of the ear. The condition can be:

    * Acute ear infection. Starts suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. It is often painful.
    * Chronic ear infection. Occurs when the ear infection does not go away or keeps coming back. It may cause long-term damage to the ear. 

Based on location otitis can be:

    * Otitis externa (swimmer's ear). Involves the outer ear and ear canal. A more severe form can spread into the bones and cartilage around the ear.
    * Otitis media (ear infection). Involves the middle ear, which is located just behind the eardrum.
    * Otitis media with effusion. Occurs when there is thick or sticky fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection. 

## Alternative Names

Ear infection; Infection - ear

## Patient Instructions

    * Ear tube surgery - what to ask your doctor
