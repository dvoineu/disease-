## Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has launched _Ending
the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America_. The initiative aims to reduce new HIV
infections in the U.S. by 90% by 2030. _Ending the HIV Epidemic_ leverages
critical scientific advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and
outbreak response by coordinating the highly successful programs, resources,
and infrastructure of many HHS agencies and offices.

The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Healthexternal icon is
coordinating this cross-agency initiative. Collaborating agencies include the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA), Indian Health Service (IHS), National
Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health,
and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

### Explore CDC's Role in _Ending the HIV Epidemic_

To achieve maximum impact, CDC is focusing resources on communities most
impacted by HIV. This provides a major boost to the bold initiative to end the
HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030. The Plan will focus first on 50
local areas that account for more than half of new HIV diagnoses (48 counties;
San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Washington, D.C.), and seven states with a
substantial rural burden. If additional resources become available, the
initiative will eventually expand nationwide. The initiative will scale up
four science-based strategies that can end the epidemic: diagnose, treat,
prevent, and respond.

**State and Local Planning Kicks Off for _Ending the HIV Epidemic_**

Community involvement is crucial to this initiative. The U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) has funded state and local health departments
to develop comprehensive _Ending the HIV Epidemic_ plans tailored by and for
each community. HHS also awarded funds to three priority areas to engage
communities, test foundational activities, and find best practices that will
help jumpstart success nationally.
