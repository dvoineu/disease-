## Summary

Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected
mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common
in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue
is rare in the United States.

Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and
a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which
causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become
dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of
dengue are life-threatening.

There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2
weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin
fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of
dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.

To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found

  * Wear insect repellent with DEET 
  * Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet 
  * Close unscreened doors and windows
