## Overview

CDC announces availability of funding for a cooperative agreement for the
Disease Intervention Training Centers (DITC). The purpose of this NOFO is
strengthen the capacity of local and state health departments to conduct
STD/HIV intervention services.  This national training center network will
support workforce capacity building for a critical classification of public
health staff, Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS). DIS are core personnel
in many local and state health departments who conduct investigation of
communicable diseases and a number of tasks related to preventing the spread
of transmission of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV. These tasks
include but are not limited to: client-centered interviews; collection of
enhanced surveillance and community assessment data; partner services,
including contact tracing; field investigation and other field-based
activities, including specimen collection, directly observed therapy;
community outreach; collaboration with medical providers and navigation of
health care systems to ensure patient evaluation, treatment, linkage to care
and other supportive services; and mobilization for outbreak investigation and
emergency response. Recent assessments completed for the National Disease
Intervention Specialist (DIS) Certification Projectexternal icon, revealed a
need for standardization of DIS training to ensure comprehensive skills sets
for this classification nationwide, and enhancement of current DIS training
platforms to better support the core functions of the classification.
Standardized training for DIS nationwide is essential for consistency and
quality of disease intervention practice, as well as ensuring transference of
uniform skills for cross-program and cross-jurisdictional response. State and
local health departments have also identified other staff classifications
(e.g., public health nurses, patient navigators, linkage to care specialists),
conducting STD and HIV intervention work, for whom the same practice standards
and training are relevant.

Funding will support a network of curriculum development and training centers,
serving local and state health jurisdictions, throughout the United States.
Available funding is categorized as follows:
