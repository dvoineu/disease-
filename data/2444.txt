### Goal Structure

NIOSH's portfolio of research programs is organized into a grid of sectors and
cross-sectors, infused with core and specialty programs. Intermediate and
activity research goals are shared by sector, cross-sector, and relevant core
and specialty programs. The blue grid below has links to more detailed
information about these goals.

### Intermediate Goals

Intermediate goals specify desired actions on the part of external
stakeholders using NIOSH research findings and outputs. In the blue grid
below, each intermediate goal is linked to separate page with a table and
descriptive text that provides more detailed information. The tables have four
columns (health outcome, research focus, worker population, and research
type), and the rows specify research needs. You can learn more about the
information presented in each table in the box below.

Health outcomes are reductions in illnesses, injuries and fatalities, as well
as improvements to health and well-being. Intermediate goals sometimes
encompass more than one health outcome, so this column provides greater
specificity. For example, a goal to reduce a workplace hazardous exposure
might contribute to reducing both cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes.

This column identifies the problems that programs want to solve. For example,
a research focus can be a hazardous exposure that contributes to an illness or
injury; an aspect of the organization of work; a risk factor for injuries,
illnesses, or decreased well-being; or a type of injury.

The worker populations with the greatest burden include either workers in a
specific job or setting, or workers with a specific hazardous exposure. In
some cases, additional worker populations experience a high burden because of
the changing nature of work and employment arrangements.

NIOSH has developed the following taxonomy for work arrangements.1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Standard work arrangement -_ An arrangement that is secure or permanent (career). These workers have employee status, stable and adequate pay, access to health insurance, paid leave and retirement benefits, a regular, full-time work schedule, and the ability to negotiate their schedule and take time off.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Non-standard work arrangement_ - An arrangement that differs in some way from the standard arrangement.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Contingent workers -_ Those with a job that they do not expect to last (see alternative definitions used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with the Contingent Work Survey2).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Precarious employment_ - Employment with some degree of the following: insecurity, temporariness, vulnerability to unfair treatment, lack of ability to negotiate pay, benefits, and work schedule, lack of ability to take leave, and lack of social safety net including unemployment and workers' compensation insurance.

Work arrangement categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, some
workers in standard arrangements may experience unfair treatment, a
characteristic of precarious employment.

The intermediate goal tables refer to two other worker populations:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Vulnerable workers_ - Different factors can make some workers more vulnerable than others to workplace illness or injury. These differences include factors, such as age, race/ethnicity, class, nativity, gender, English language skills, and disability status; economic trends, such as growth of the temporary workforce; and organizational factors, such as business size. Vulnerable workers have increased rates of work-related injuries and illnesses.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Small businesses_ - For most occupational safety and health research purposes, NIOSH considers small businesses as having fewer than 50 employees. Smaller businesses often have fewer resources to devote to occupational safety and health because they face a riskier economic environment and have greater financial limitations than larger businesses.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Young worker_ - NIOSH defines young workers as those between the ages of 15 and 24. Federal and state child labor laws, which regulate the employment of minors, are tied to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 ("Fair Labor Standards Act," 1938). The FLSA limits the types of jobs youths aged 14 to 17 years are allowed to perform, the number of hours they may work, and the timing of these hours. However, national injury and fatality data usually do not include youth under age 15.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Older workers_ - There is no consensus on the definition of "older worker." Generally, in the United States, research efforts tend to focus on the age group 55 years or older. But other age thresholds are sometimes used, such as 50 years or older (AARP) and 40 years or older (Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967).  However, it is important to acknowledge that chronological age, by itself, is not always a strong predictor of workplace outcomes, and that aging is a complex process influenced by many factors. As a result, there can be great individual variability in the work ability and occupational safety and health outcomes among older workers. Therefore, researchers should be aware that it might be of more value to think about a worker's lifespan and not an absolute chronological age at which all workers can be considered "older."

Each intermediate goal is also accompanied by a short description of the
burden and need, based on the _Burden, Need, and Impact Method_. Together, the
tables and description guide researchers to high priority areas, while
allowing flexibility for new ideas.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Basic/etiologic_ : Builds a foundation of scientific knowledge to base future interventions. Most laboratory research falls into this category, as well as exposure assessment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Intervention_ : Engages in the development, testing, or evaluation of a solution to an occupational safety and health problem or the improvement of an existing intervention. Intervention is a broad term that includes engineering controls, personal protective equipment, training, and fact sheets, and other written materials intended to inform and change behavior, among other occupational safety and health solutions.

This type of research seeks to understand why available, effective, evidence-based interventions are not being adopted.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Surveillance_ : Develops _new_ surveillance methods, tools, and analytical techniques.

Each intermediate goal is also accompanied by a short description of the
burden and need, based on the Burden, Need, and Impact Method. Together, the
tables and description guide researchers to high priority areas, while
allowing flexibility for new ideas.

### Activity Goals

Activity goals describe which of the four types of research will move goals
along the research to practice (r2p) continuum. They are presented on the
intermediate goal pages with their "parent" goal.  Each activity goal includes
the types of research, the health outcome, and the sector in which the
research will be undertaken.
