## Summary

There are many kinds of families. Some have two parents, while others have a
single parent. Sometimes there is no parent and grandparents raise
grandchildren. Some children live in foster families, adoptive families, or in
stepfamilies.

Families are much more than groups of people who share the same genes or the
same address. They should be a source of love and support. This does not mean
that everyone gets along all the time. Conflicts are a part of family life.
Many things can lead to conflict, such as illness, disability, addiction, job
loss, school problems, and marital issues. Listening to each other and working
to resolve conflicts are important in strengthening the family.
