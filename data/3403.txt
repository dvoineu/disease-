About Vital Signs

The  _CDC Vital Signs_ monthly report was launched in 2010. It generally
includes an _MMWR_ early release, a graphic fact sheet and website, a media
release, and social media tools. Most of the materials are available in
English and Spanish.

Vital Signs reports cover an important health threat and what can be done to
drive down the disease. Past topics have included cancer screening, alcohol
and tobacco use, HIV testing, motor vehicle safety, cardiovascular disease,
healthcare-associated infections, and foodborne disease.

Please sign up to get Vital Signs through email each month at Vital Signs.
Feel free to share CDC Vital Signs information broadly with your partners.
Take advantage of CDC's social media tools, such as the CDC Vital Signs
buttons and email updates. You can have CDC Vital Signs reports sent directly
