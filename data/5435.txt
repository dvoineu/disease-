Much is known about the risk factors for waterborne illness, but the overall
occurrence of waterborne illness in the U.S. is unknown. Regulatory and public
health agencies and academic researchers have published estimates of the
number of illnesses associated with U.S. drinking water systems and marine
water venues. These waterborne disease burden estimates provide a foundation
for future work to quantify all U.S. waterborne illness, but these current
estimates do not include all types of waterborne disease nor waterborne
disease from all possible types of water exposures and venues.

Pathogen-specific illness and cost estimates also provide important
contributions to understanding the health impact of particular waterborne
diseases. Many of these pathogens can also be spread in other ways in addition
to water (for example, food, person-to-person). The total disease burden from
each pathogen and the proportion due to waterborne transmission will both
inform the comprehensive waterborne burden of disease estimate.

The following publications highlight what is currently known about the scope
and burden of waterborne illness in the U.S:
