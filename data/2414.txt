# NIOSH DATA AND STATISTICS GATEWAY

Data are fundamental to worker safety and health research and surveillance
conducted at NIOSH. They drive health and safety research priorities and
recommendations produced by NIOSH. The data produced and used by NIOSH can
also benefit other researchers and practitioners as well as the general
public. This NIOSH Data and Statistics page has been developed to provide
centralized access to NIOSH data. It can be used to find available NIOSH data
and statistics and resources in a variety of forms. See data definitions to
easily identify data types. The NIOSH Data A-Z index below categorizes topics
for which data are available.

Surveillance Data

Access to a range of CDC/NIOSH surveillance resources. Can be used as a
central checkpoint for the latest NIOSH surveillance data and statistics as
well as historic NIOSH surveillance information.

Surveillance Data and Statistics

Other Data Resources

Systems that provide information about NIOSH investigations, products,
hazards, and a variety of tests and measurements.
