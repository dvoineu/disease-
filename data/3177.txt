# Prothrombin deficiency

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Prothrombin deficiency is a disorder caused by a lack of a protein in the
blood called prothrombin. It leads to problems with blood clotting
(coagulation). Prothrombin is also known as factor II (factor two).

## Causes

When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood
clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves
special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a
higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing
or are not functioning like they should.

Prothrombin, or factor II, is one such coagulation factor. Prothrombin
deficiency runs in families (inherited) and is very rare. Both parents must
have the gene to pass the disorder on to their children. A family history of a
bleeding disorder can be a risk factor.

Prothrombin deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain
medicines. This is called acquired prothrombin deficiency. It can be caused
by:

    * Lack of vitamin K (some babies are born with vitamin K deficiency)
    * Severe liver disease
    * Use of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin) 

## Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:

    * Abnormal bleeding after childbirth
    * Heavy menstrual bleeding
    * Bleeding after surgery
    * Bleeding after trauma
    * Bruising easily
    * Nosebleeds that do not stop easily
    * Umbilical cord bleeding after birth 

## Exams and Tests

Tests that may be done include:

    * Factor II assay
    * Partial thromboplastin time
    * Prothrombin time (PT)
    * Mixing study (a special PTT test to confirm prothrombin deficiency)

## Treatment

Bleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma or
concentrates of clotting factors. If you lack vitamin K, you can take this
vitamin by mouth, through injections under the skin, or through a vein
(intravenously).

If you have this bleeding disorder, be sure to:

    * Tell your health care providers before you have any kind of procedure, including surgery and dental work.
    * Tell your family members because they may have the same disorder but do not know it yet. 

## Support Groups

These resources can provide more information on Factor VII deficiency:

    * National Hemophilia Foundation: Other Factor Deficiencies -- www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders/Types-of-Bleeding-Disorders/Other-Factor-Deficiencies
    * NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2926/prothrombin-deficiency

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome is good with proper treatment.

Inherited prothrombin deficiency is a lifelong condition.

The outlook for acquired prothrombin deficiency depends on the cause. If it is
caused by liver disease, the outcome depends on how well your liver disease
can be treated. Taking vitamin K supplements will treat vitamin K deficiency.

## Possible Complications

Severe bleeding in the organs can occur.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Get emergency treatment right away if you have unexplained or long-term blood
loss, or if you cannot control the bleeding.

## Prevention

There is no known prevention for inherited prothrombin deficiency. When a lack
of vitamin K is the cause, using vitamin K can help.

## Alternative Names

Hypoprothrombinemia; Factor II deficiency; Dysprothrombinemia
