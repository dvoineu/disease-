To determine the amount of PPE your hospital needs to manage a patient with
Ebola, click **HERE**.

To determine the amount of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) a hospital
needs for a multi-disciplinary healthcare team managing a patient with Ebola,
facilities should consider various factors including: acuity of patient,
configuration of the healthcare team/roles and intended interaction with
patient, length of shifts, number of required breaks for staff wearing PPE,
isolation unit location and support strategies, waste management strategy, lab
location, lab testing demand, hospital protocols for products, and length of
patient's hospital stay. Hospital inventory needs must be assessed on a case
by case basis and should consider these and any other relevant factors.
Because the ability to stockpile large amounts of PPE may be limited and re-
ordering may not be immediate, it is recommended that facilities determine an
appropriate interval for par level monitoring of PPE (e.g. every 8 hours) and
designate a specific member of the team to complete this task.

**Staffing models may include some of the following roles that should be
considered when determining how much Ebola PPE is needed:**

**Healthcare Team Roles and Descriptions:**

**Role**

|

**Description**  
  
---|---  
Nurses responsible for direct or indirect patient care | Nursing staff
providing direct patient care. Includes primary and support nurses that are
either in the patient room or in the anteroom donned and ready to care for
patients or assist if needed. In many centers, this role may also be
responsible for environmental cleaning while the patient is in the room.  
Physician providing direct patient care | Includes any physician or specialty
care practitioner entering the patient's room.  
Trained observer to assist with donning/doffing | Person assisting with
donning/doffing of PPE.  
Environmental cleaning | Person responsible for cleaning/decontaminating the
patient's room while the patient is present. May not require dedicated staff
if nurses responsible for direct care perform environmental cleaning of
patient room and anteroom.  
Laboratory staff handling specimens | Staff should be considered if PPE is
needed beyond normal PPE provided to lab staff  
  
**The following are examples of staffing models for Ebola Assessment Hospitals
that have experienced caring for persons under investigation (PUI). These may
be helpful when planning the configuration of your facility 's health care
team:**

**How much product will each member of the team need per shift?**

The table below provides estimates to help determine the number of changes of
PPE each staff member on a team may need per shift. **_Quantities for products
needed per shift should be multiplied by number of persons serving in that
healthcare team role._** Information in the table is a guide to help
deliberate PPE needs. Facility estimates may vary from these projections based
on facility specific planning and protocols.

* Quantity of product per shift may vary based on multiple factors including patient acuity, length of shifts, breaks etc. Estimates in table assume 3-4 hour shift.

**Hospitals may have additional roles that need to be considered. Roles in the
table are defined above under " **Healthcare Team Roles and Descriptions. "**

^ Reference CDC PPE guidance for specifications for impermeable and fluid-
resistant gowns and coveralls.

^^ Powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) blower units/system s are not
included in the table. These items may be reused post decontamination.
Therefore, the quantity of PAPR blower units/systems needed per shift and per
day should be based on the number of persons that may be using a PAPR blower
and the time needed to decontaminate and ensure that these products are ready
for use. One PAPR blower units/system will be needed for each staff member per
shift who will be in direct contact with the patient. Should consider having
1.5 to 2 shifts worth of PAPR blower units/systems on hand to account for
changing of staff and decon time.

# Follow the manufacturer's guidance to determine the need to replace/dispose
of a filter during PAPR decontamination. Several manufacturers have added
specific instructions for cleaning, disinfecting, and decontamination after
use with a known or suspected Ebola patient. Estimate in the table assumes
filter is being changed with each shroud/hood change.

## N95 respirator selection must include surgical hood and full face shield.
