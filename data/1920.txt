#  Canker Sores

Also called: Aphthous ulcers

## Summary

Canker sores are small, round sores in your mouth. They can be on the inside
of your cheek, under your tongue, or in the back of your throat. They usually
have a red edge and a gray center. They can be quite painful. They are not the
same as cold sores, which are caused by herpes simplex.

Canker sores aren't contagious. They may happen if you have a viral infection.
They may also be triggered by stress, food allergies, lack of vitamins and
minerals, hormonal changes or menstrual periods. In some cases the cause is
unknown.

In most cases, the sores go away by themselves. Some ointments, creams or
rinses may help with the pain. Avoiding hot, spicy food while you have a
canker sore also helps.
