## Summary

An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not
bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to
more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are

    * Pollen
    * Dust mites
    * Mold spores
    * Pet dander
    * Food
    * Insect stings
    * Medicines

Normally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system.
In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes
and the environment probably both play a role.

Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing,
itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to
severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening. Doctors
use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines,
allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.
