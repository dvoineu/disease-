## Summary

A medical device is any product used to diagnose, cure, or treat a condition,
or to prevent disease. They range from small and simple, like a blood glucose
meter, to large and complicated, like a ventilator. You might use one at home
or at work, or you may need one in a hospital.

To use medical devices safely

    * Know how your device works. Keep instructions close by
    * Understand and properly respond to device alarms
    * Have a back-up plan and supplies in the event of an emergency
    * Keep emergency numbers available and update them as needed
    * Educate your family and caregivers about your device
