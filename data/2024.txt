## Summary

Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at
the wrong time. You may have overactive bladder if you have two or more of
these symptoms:

    * You urinate eight or more times a day or two or more times at night
    * You have the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately
    * You leak urine after a sudden, strong urge to urinate

You also may have incontinence, a loss of bladder control. Nerve problems, too
much fluid, or too much caffeine can cause it. Often the cause is unknown.

Your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves. The
medicine may come as a pill, a liquid, or a patch. The medicines can cause
your eyes to become dry. They can also cause dry mouth and constipation. To
deal with these effects, use eye drops to keep your eyes moist, chew sugarless
gum or suck on sugarless hard candy if dry mouth bothers you, and take small
sips of water throughout the day.
