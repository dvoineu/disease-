Local and/or state health departments may be able to provide guidelines for
preventing and controlling scabies outbreaks.

Below are suggestions for developing guidelines for preventing, detecting, and
responding to a single case or multiple cases of **crusted (Norwegian)
scabies** in an institution.

#### Surveillance

_Establish surveillance._

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Identify and treat all patients, staff, and visitors who may have been exposed to a patient with crusted scabies or to clothing, bedding, furniture or other items (fomites) used by such a patient; strongly consider treatment even in equivocal circumstances because controlling an outbreak involving crusted scabies can be very difficult and risk associated with treatment is relatively low.
