## Summary

A scar is a permanent patch of skin that grows over a wound. It forms when
your body heals itself after a cut, scrape, burn, or sore. You can also get
scars from surgery that cuts through the skin, infections like chickenpox, or
skin conditions like acne. Scars are often thicker, as well as pinker, redder,
or shinier, than the rest of your skin.

How your scar looks depends on

  * How big and deep your wound is
  * Where it is 
  * How long it takes to heal 
  * Your age
  * Your inherited tendency to scar

Scars usually fade over time but never go away completely. If the way a scar
looks bothers you, various treatments might minimize it. These include
surgical revision, dermabrasion, laser treatments, injections, chemical peels,
and creams.
