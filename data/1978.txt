## Summary

People with dwarfism have short stature. This means that their height is under
4' 10" as an adult. They are usually of normal intelligence. Dwarfism most
often does happen in families where both parents are of average height.

More than 300 different conditions can cause dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the
most common type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that
affects about 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 people. It makes your arms and legs
short in comparison to your head and trunk. You may also have a larger head
and weak muscle tone. Other genetic conditions, kidney disease, and problems
with metabolism or hormones can also cause dwarfism.

The conditions that cause dwarfism can also cause other health problems. Most
of them are treatable. It is important to have regular checkups throughout
your life. With proper medical care, most people with dwarfism have active
lives and live as long as other people.
