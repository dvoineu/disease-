## Summary

Many older people are victims of elder abuse. It is the mistreatment of an
older person, usually by a caregiver. It can happen within the family. It can
also happen in assisted living facilities or nursing homes.

The mistreatment may be

  * Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
  * Neglect or abandonment
  * Financial abuse - stealing of money or belongings

Possible signs of elder abuse include unexplained bruises, burns, and
injuries. There may also be bed sores and poor hygiene. The person may become
withdrawn, agitated, and depressed. There may be a sudden change in the
person's financial situation.

Elder abuse will not stop on its own. Someone else needs to step in and help.
If you think that an older person is in urgent danger, call 911. Otherwise,
contact adult protective services.
