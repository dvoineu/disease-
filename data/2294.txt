# VLDL test

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

VLDL stands for very low density lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are made up of
cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteins. They move cholesterol,
triglycerides, and other lipids (fats) to around the body.

VLDL is one of the three main types of lipoproteins. VLDL contains the highest
amount of triglycerides. VLDL is a type of "bad cholesterol" because it helps
cholesterol build up on the walls of arteries.

A lab test is used to measure the amount of VLDL in your blood.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located
on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.

## How the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also
feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.

## Why the Test is Performed

You may have this test to help assess your risk for heart disease. Increased
levels of VLDL are linked to atherosclerosis. This condition can lead to
coronary heart disease.

This test may be included in a coronary risk profile.

## Normal Results

Normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 2 and 30 mg/dL.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to
your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests.
Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

A high VLDL cholesterol level may be associated with a higher risk for heart
disease and stroke. However, VLDL cholesterol level is rarely targeted when
treatment for high cholesterol is done. Instead, LDL cholesterol level is more
often the main target of therapy.

## Risks

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side
of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be
more difficult than from others.

The risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:

    * Excessive bleeding
    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)

## Considerations

There is no direct way of measuring VLDL. Most labs estimate your VLDL based
on your triglycerides level. It is about one fifth of your triglycerides
level. This estimate is less accurate if your triglycerides level is above 400
mg/dL.
