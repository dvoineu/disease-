#  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome

Also called: Causalgia, CRPS, Reflex sympathetic dystrophy

## Summary

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition. It causes
intense pain, usually in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. It may happen after
an injury, either to a nerve or to tissue in the affected area. Rest and time
may only make it worse.

Symptoms in the affected area are

    * Dramatic changes in skin temperature, color, or texture
    * Intense burning pain
    * Extreme skin sensitivity
    * Swelling and stiffness in affected joints
    * Decreased ability to move the affected body part

The cause of CRPS is unknown. There is no specific diagnostic test. Your
doctor will diagnose CRPS based on your signs and symptoms.

There is no cure. It can get worse over time, and may spread to other parts of
the body. Occasionally the symptoms go away, either temporarily or for good.
Treatment focuses on relieving the pain, and can include medicines, physical
therapy, and nerve blocks.
