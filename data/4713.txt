Urticaria pigmentosa is a skin disease that produces patches of darker skin
and very bad itching. Hives can develop when these skin areas are rubbed.

## Causes

Urticaria pigmentosa occurs when there are too many inflammatory cells (mast
cells) in the skin. Mast cells are immune system cells that help the body
fight infections. Mast cells make and release histamine, which causes nearby
tissues to become swollen and inflamed.

Things that can trigger histamine release and skin symptoms include:

    * Rubbing the skin
    * Infections
    * Exercise
    * Drinking hot liquids, eating spicy food
    * Sunlight, exposure to cold
    * Medicines, such as aspirin or other NSAIDs, codeine, morphine, x-ray dye, some anesthesia medicines, alcohol 

Urticaria pigmentosa is most common in children. It can also occur in adults.

## Symptoms

The main symptom is brownish patches on the skin. These patches contain cells
called mastocytes. When mastocytes release the chemical histamine, the patches
develop into hive-like bumps. Younger children may develop a blister that is
filled with fluid if the bump is scratched.

The face may also get red quickly.

In severe cases, these symptoms may occur:

    * Diarrhea
    * Fainting (uncommon)
    * Headache
    * Wheeze
    * Rapid heartbeat 

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine the skin. The provider may suspect
urticarial pigmentosa when the skin patches are rubbed and raised bumps
(hives) develop. This is called the Darier sign.

Tests to check for this condition are:

    * Skin biopsy to look for a higher number of mast cells
    * Urine histamine 
    * Blood tests for blood cell counts and blood tryptase levels (tryptase is an enzyme found in mast cells)

## Treatment

Antihistamine medicines can help relieve symptoms such as itching and
flushing. Talk to your provider about which type of antihistamine to use.
Corticosteroids applied on the skin and light therapy can also be used in some
cases.

Your provider may prescribe other kinds of medicine to treat symptoms of
severe and unusual forms of urticaria pigmentosa.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Urticaria pigmentosa goes away by puberty in about one half of affected
children. Symptoms usually get better in others as they grow into adulthood.

In adults, urticaria pigmentosa can lead to systemic mastocytosis. This is a
serious condition that can affect bones, the brain, nerves, and the digestive
system.

## Possible Complications

The main problems are discomfort from itching and concern about the appearance
of the spots. Other problems such as diarrhea and fainting are rare.

Insect stings may also cause a bad allergic reaction in people with urticaria
pigmentosa. Ask your provider if you should carry an epinephrine kit to use if
you get a bee sting.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you notice symptoms of urticaria pigmentosa.

## Alternative Names

Mastocytosis; Mastocytoma
