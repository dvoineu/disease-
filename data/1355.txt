Florence Tangka, PhD, MS, is a health economist in the Division of Cancer
Prevention and Control's Epidemiology and Applied Research Branch. She is the
principal investigator for a number of CDC cancer economics studies. Her
research focuses on the economics of cancer, economics of CDC's National
Program of Cancer Registries and Colorectal Cancer Control Program, and use of
breast and cervical cancer screening services.

Dr. Tangka received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Reading in
the United Kingdom and a Masters from Rutgers (both degrees are in
agricultural economics). In 2008, she received an alumni award from Rutgers.
She received her doctoral degree from the University of Florida, Department of
Food and Resource Economics, and completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship
in Prevention Effectiveness at CDC.

Dr. Tangka has authored and coauthored more than 90 publications in peer-
reviewed journals, including _Health Affairs, Health Services Research
Journal, Journal of Public Health Management & Practice, Journal of Racial and
Ethnic Health Disparities, Journal of the National Medical Association, Health
Economics, American Journal of Managed Care, Cancer, Medical Care, Health
Promotion Practice, Cancer Causes & Control, American Journal of Preventive
Medicine, Gastroenterology, Journal of Registry Management, Urology,
Evaluation and Program Planning, Medicare & Medicaid Research Review, Journal
of Community Health, Journal of Women's Health, Annals of Oncology, Health &

Oncology,_ and _The Wall Street Journal._

Dr. Tangka leads CDC's effort in the Health Insurance Coverage Status by Age,
Race, Hispanic Origin, Sex, and Income for Counties and Statesexternal icon
project. This project provides estimates of the low-income, uninsured
populations at the state and county levels, published as a data set called
Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, which are the only source for estimates
of health insurance coverage status for all counties in the nation. They are
the result of a multi-year collaboration between CDC's Division of Cancer
Prevention and Control and the Census Bureau's Small Area Estimates Branch.

The most recent articles Dr. Tangka has first-authored include--
