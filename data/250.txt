## Summary

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a condition that causes discomfort or pain in
the bladder and a need to urinate frequently and urgently. It is far more
common in women than in men. The symptoms vary from person to person. Some
people may have pain without urgency or frequency. Others have urgency and
frequency without pain. Women's symptoms often get worse during their periods.
They may also have pain with sexual intercourse.

The cause of IC isn't known. There is no one test to tell if you have it.
Doctors often run tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. There
is no cure for IC, but treatments can help most people feel better. They
include

  * Distending, or inflating, the bladder
  * Bathing the inside of the bladder with a drug solution
  * Oral medicines
  * Electrical nerve stimulation
  * Physical therapy
  * Lifestyle changes
  * Bladder training
  * In rare cases, surgery
