Routine vaccines |

Make sure you are up-to-date on routine vaccines before every trip. These
vaccines include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-
pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, and your
yearly flu shot.

#### Some travelers

Ask your doctor what vaccines and medicines you need based on where you are
going, how long you are staying, what you will be doing, and if you are
traveling from a country other than the US.  
  
Rabies |

Although rabies can be found in bats and other mammals in Saint Pierre and
Miquelon, it is not a major risk to most travelers. CDC recommends rabies
vaccine for only these groups:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Travelers involved in outdoor and other activities in remote areas that put them at risk for bat bites or other animal bites (such as adventure travel and caving).

Hepatitis A |

Hepatitis A outbreaks occur throughout the world and sometimes in countries
with a low risk for hepatitis A (including the US). You can get hepatitis A
through contaminated food or water in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, so talk to
your doctor to see if the hepatitis A vaccine is right for you.

![eat_drink](/travel/content/images/protect-icons/eat_drink.png)  
Hepatitis B |

You can get hepatitis B through sexual contact, contaminated needles, and
blood products, so CDC recommends this vaccine if you might have sex with a
new partner, get a tattoo or piercing, or have any medical procedures.

Bugs (like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas) can spread a number of diseases in
Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Many of these diseases cannot be prevented with a
vaccine or medicine. You can reduce your risk by taking steps to prevent bug
bites.

### Keep away from animals

Most animals avoid people, but they may attack if they feel threatened, are
protecting their young or territory, or if they are injured or ill. Animal
bites and scratches can lead to serious diseases such as rabies.

Ask your doctor to help you get prescriptions filled early if you need to.

Many foreign hospitals and clinics are accredited by the Joint Commission
International. A list of accredited facilities is available at their website
(www.jointcommissioninternational.org).

In some countries, medicine (prescription and over-the-counter) may be
substandard or counterfeit. Bring the medicines you will need from the United
States to avoid having to buy them at your destination.

### Select safe transportation

**Motor vehicle crashes are the #1 killer of healthy US citizens in foreign
countries.**

In many places cars, buses, large trucks, rickshaws, bikes, people on foot,
and even animals share the same lanes of traffic, increasing the risk for
crashes.

##### Walking

Be smart when you are traveling on foot.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Use sidewalks and marked crosswalks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Remember, people on foot do not always have the right of way in other countries.

##### Medical Evacuation Insurance

If you are seriously injured, emergency care may not be available or may not
meet US standards. Trauma care centers are uncommon outside urban areas.
Having medical evacuation insurance can be helpful for these reasons.
