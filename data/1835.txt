## Summary

The anus is where stool leaves your body when you go to the bathroom. It is
made up of your outer layers of skin and the end of your large intestine. Anal
cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the anus.

Anal cancer is rare. It is more common in smokers and people over 50. You are
also at higher risk if you have HPV, have anal sex, or have many sexual
partners.

Symptoms include bleeding, pain, or lumps in the anal area. Anal itching and
discharge can also be signs of anal cancer.

Doctors use tests that examine the anus to diagnose anal cancer. They include
a physical exam, endoscopy, ultrasound, and biopsy.

Treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery.
