## Summary

Breastfeeding offers many benefits to your baby. Breast milk contains the
right balance of nutrients to help your infant grow into a strong and healthy
toddler. Some of the nutrients in breast milk also help protect your infant
against some common childhood illnesses and infections. It may also help your
health. Certain types of cancer may occur less often in mothers who have
breastfed their babies.

Women who don't have health problems should try to give their babies breast
milk for at least the first six months of life. Most women with health
problems can breastfeed. There are rare exceptions when women are advised not
to breastfeed because they have certain illnesses. Some medicines, illegal
drugs, and alcohol can also pass through the breast milk and cause harm to
your baby. Check with your health care provider if you have concerns about
whether you should breastfeed.

If you are having problems with breastfeeding, contact a lactation consultant.
