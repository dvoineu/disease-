# Calorie count - fast food

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Fast food is easy and available almost everywhere. However, a lot of fast food
is high in calories, saturated fat, and salt. Yet sometimes, you may need the
convenience of fast food. You do not have to avoid fast food completely, just
need to make healthier choices. Try to include a salad with your meal, but be
careful with creamy dressing or fried toppings. Choose baked instead of fried
options.

You can find nutrition information for most fast food chains online or in the
restaurant. Some fast food chains also have special menu options that are
healthier. Use this information to help you make better choices when you
choose fast food.

Here is a list of some popular fast food items, their serving sizes, and the
number of calories in each.
