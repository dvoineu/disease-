## Summary

If you have diabetes, your body cannot make or properly use insulin. This
leads to high blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels. Healthy eating helps keep
your blood sugar in your target range. It is a critical part of managing your
diabetes, because controlling your blood sugar can prevent the complications
of diabetes.

A registered dietitian can help make an eating plan just for you. It should
take into account your weight, medicines, lifestyle, and other health problems
you have.

Healthy diabetic eating includes

  * Limiting foods that are high in sugar 
  * Eating smaller portions, spread out over the day
  * Being careful about when and how many carbohydrates you eat
  * Eating a variety of whole-grain foods, fruits and vegetables every day
  * Eating less fat
  * Limiting your use of alcohol
  * Using less salt
