## Summary

The tissue that lines your lungs, stomach, heart, and other organs is called
mesothelium. Mesothelioma, also known as malignant mesothelioma, is cancer of
that tissue. It usually starts in the lungs, but can also start in the abdomen
or other organs.

Malignant mesothelioma is rare but serious. Most people who get it have worked
on jobs where they inhaled asbestos particles. After being exposed to
asbestos, it usually takes a long time for the disease to form.

Symptoms include

    * Trouble breathing
    * Pain under the rib cage
    * Pain, swelling, or lumps in the abdomen
    * Weight loss for no known reason

Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between malignant mesothelioma and
lung cancer. Your doctor uses imaging tests and a biopsy to make the
diagnosis. Malignant mesothelioma is often found when it is advanced. This
makes it harder to treat. Treatment may include surgery, radiation,
chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other
substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.
