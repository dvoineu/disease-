# Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair - open - discharge

Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part
in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that
carries blood to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs.

## When You're in the Hospital

You had open aortic aneurysm surgery to repair an aneurysm (a widened part) in
your aorta, the large artery that carries blood to your belly (abdomen),
pelvis, and legs.

You have a long incision (cut) either in the middle of your belly or on the
left side of your belly. Your surgeon repaired your aorta through this
incision. After spending 1 to 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), you
spent more time recovering in a regular hospital room.

## What to Expect at Home

Plan to have someone drive you home from the hospital. DO NOT drive yourself
home.

You should be able to do most of your regular activities in 4 to 8 weeks.
Before that:

      * DO NOT lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (5 to 7 kg) until you see your health care provider.
      * Avoid all strenuous activity, including heavy exercising, weightlifting, and other activities that make you breathe hard or strain.
      * Short walks and using stairs are OK.
      * Light housework is OK.
      * DO NOT push yourself too hard.
      * Increase how much you exercise slowly. 

## Managing pain

Your provider will prescribe pain medicines for you to use at home. If you are
taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each
day for 3 to 4 days. They may be more effective this way.

Get up and move around if you are having some pain in your belly. This may
ease your pain.

Press a pillow over your incision when you cough or sneeze to ease discomfort
and protect your incision.

Make sure your home is safe as you are recovering.

## Wound Care

Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it
becomes soiled. Your provider will tell you when you do not need to keep your
wound covered. Keep the wound area clean. You may wash it with mild soap and
water if your provider says you can.

You may remove the wound dressings and take showers if sutures, staples, or
glue were used to close your skin, or if your provider says you can.

If tape strips (Steri-strips) were used to close your incision, cover the
incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. DO NOT try to
wash off the Steri-strips or glue.

DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your doctor tells
you it is OK.

## Lifestyle Changes

Surgery does not cure the underlying problem with your blood vessels. Other
blood vessels could be affected in the future, so lifestyle changes and
medical management are important:

      * Eat a heart-healthy diet.
      * Get regular exercise.
      * Stop smoking (if you smoke).
      * Take the medicines your provider has prescribed as directed. These may include medicines to lower cholesterol, control blood pressure, and treat diabetes. 

## When to Call the Doctor

Call your provider if:

      * You have pain in your belly or back that does not go away or is very bad.
      * Your legs are swelling.
      * You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.
      * You experience dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired.
      * You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.
      * You have chills or a fever over 100.5Â°F (38Â°C).
      * Your belly hurts or feels distended.
      * You have blood in your stool or develop bloody diarrhea.
      * You are not able to move your legs.

Also call your provider if there are changes in your surgical incision, such
as:

      * The edges are pulling apart.
      * You have green or yellow drainage.
      * You have more redness, pain, warmth, or swelling.
      * Your bandage is soaked with blood or clear fluid.
