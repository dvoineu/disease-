damage. Examples include beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, selenium, and
vitamins C and E. They are found in many foods, including fruits and
vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. Most research has
not shown antioxidant supplements to be helpful in preventing diseases.

## Dietary Supplements

A dietary supplement is a product you take to supplement your diet. It
contains one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins; minerals; herbs
or other botanicals; amino acids; and other substances). Supplements do not
have to go through the testing that drugs do for effectiveness and safety.

## Folate

Folate is a B-vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. A form of
folate called folic acid is used in dietary supplements and fortified foods.
Our bodies need folate to make DNA and other genetic material. Folate is also
needed for the bodyâs cells to divide. It is important for women to get
enough folic acid before and during pregnancy. It can prevent major birth
defects of the baby's brain or spine.

## Multivitamin/Mineral Supplements

Multivitamin/mineral supplements contain a combination of vitamins and
minerals. They sometimes have other ingredients, such as herbs. They are also
called multis, multiples, or simply vitamins. Multis help people get the
recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals when they cannot or do not get
enough of these nutrients from food.

like cereals.

## Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 helps keep the bodyâs nerve and blood cells healthy. It helps
make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vitamin B12 also helps prevent a
type of anemia that makes people tired and weak. Vitamin B12 is found
naturally in a wide variety of animal foods. It is also added to some
fortified foods and is found in most multivitamin supplements.

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an antioxidant. It is important for your skin, bones, and
connective tissue. It promotes healing and helps the body absorb iron. Vitamin
C comes from fruits and vegetables. Good sources include citrus, red and green
peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and greens. Some juices and cereals have added
vitamin C.

## Vitamin D

Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building
blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as
osteoporosis or rickets. Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and
immune systems. You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin (from
sunlight), from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D
naturally after exposure to sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead
to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from
other sources. Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and
liver. Some other foods, like milk and cereal, often have added vitamin D. You
can also take vitamin D supplements. Check with your health care provider to
see how much you should take.

## Vitamin E

Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It plays a role in your immune system and
metabolic processes. Most people get enough vitamin E from the foods they eat.
Good sources of vitamin E include vegetable oils, margarine, nuts and seeds,
and leafy greens. Vitamin E is added to foods like cereals. It is also
available as a supplement.

## Vitamin K

Vitamin K helps your body by making proteins for healthy bones and tissues. It
also makes proteins for blood clotting. There are different types of vitamin
K. Most people get vitamin K from plants such as green vegetables and dark
berries. Bacteria in your intestines also produce small amounts of another
type of vitamin K.

urine.
