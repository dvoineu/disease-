The peritoneum is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and
covers most of the abdominal organs. Peritonitis is present when this tissue
becomes inflamed or infected. Secondary peritonitis is when another condition
is the cause.

## Causes

Secondary peritonitis has several major causes.

    * Bacteria may enter the peritoneum through a hole (perforation) in an of the organ digestive tract. The hole may be caused by a ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer, or perforated colon. It may also come from an injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound.
    * Bile or chemicals released by the pancreas may leak into the abdominal cavity. This may be caused by sudden swelling and inflammation of the pancreas.
    * Tubes or catheters placed into the abdomen may cause this problem. These include catheters for peritoneal dialysis, feeding tubes, and others.

An infection of the bloodstream (sepsis) may lead to an infection in the
abdomen also. This is a severe illness.

This tissue may become infected when there is no clear cause.

Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies.
This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or born early.

## Symptoms

Symptoms include:

    * Swollen abdomenÂ when your belly area is bigger than usual
    * Abdominal pain
    * Decreased appetite
    * Fever
    * Low urine output
    * Nausea
    * Thirst
    * Vomiting

Note: There may be signs of shock.

## Exams and Tests

During a physical exam, the health care provider may notice abnormal vital
signs with fever, rapid heart rate and breathing, and low blood pressure.

Tests may include:

    * Blood culture
    * Blood chemistry, including pancreatic enzymes
    * Complete blood count
    * Liver and kidney function tests
    * X-rays or CT scan
    * Peritoneal fluid culture
    * Urinalysis 

## Treatment

Often, surgery is needed to remove or treat sources of infection. These may be
an infected bowel, an inflamed appendix, or an abscess.

General treatment includes:

    * Antibiotics
    * Fluids through a vein (IV)
    * Pain medicines
    * Tube through the nose into the stomach or intestine (nasogastric or NG tube) 

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome can range from complete recovery to overwhelming infection and
death. Factors that determine the outcome include:

    * How long the symptoms were present before treatment began
    * The person's general health 

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Abscess
    * Gangrene (dead) bowel
    * Intraperitoneal adhesions (a potential cause of future bowel blockage)
    * Septic shock

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you have symptoms of peritonitis. This is a serious
condition. It needs emergency treatment in most cases.
