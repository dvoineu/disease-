### Integrating Primary Care and Community-Based Strategies to Prevent and
Treat Childhood Obesity

![Photo: A doctor placing a stethoscope on a girl's

All children deserve to grow up at a healthy weight. Many research initiatives
have studied ways to prevent and manage childhood obesity. Historically, these
initiatives had a limited ability to affect the multiple community settings
that influence children's nutrition and physical activity behaviors.

In 2011, with funds authorized from the Children's Health Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act, CDC funded **three community grantees** and **one
evaluation center** to conduct Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration
Projects (CORD 1.0). These 4-year projects were designed to cover various
levels of the socioecological modelexternal icon (SEM). The projects combined
efforts from **pediatric health care settings** with public health
interventions in **schools, early care and education centers, and
communities**.

CORD 1.0 targeted communities with a high proportion of children from low-
income working families. The three selected grantees worked in both rural and
urban communities in Texas, Massachusetts, and California. The CORD 1.0
project funding period ended on September 29, 2015.

Building on what was learned from the first demonstration, CORD 2.0 focuses on
improving clinical-community linkages for the prevention and management of
childhood obesity. CORD 2.0 tests a model that increases obesity screening and
counseling services for eligible children in the selected communities, and
refers them to local pediatric weight management programs. Learn more about
CORD 2.0.
