#  Floods

## Summary

Floods are common in the United States. Weather such as heavy rain,
thunderstorms, hurricanes, or tsunamis can cause flooding. Flooding can also
happen when a river or stream overflows its bank, when a levee is breached, or
when a dam breaks. Flash floods, which can develop quickly, often have a
dangerous wall of roaring water. The wall carries rocks, mud, and rubble and
can sweep away most things in its path.

Be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live
in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Although there are
no guarantees of safety during a flood, you can take actions to protect
yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce
fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to
feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.
