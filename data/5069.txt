What is MRSA?

MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant  _Staphylococcus aureus_ , a type of
bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics.

##### **Outside of Healthcare Settings**

In the community (where you live, work, shop, and go to school), MRSA most
often causes skin infections. In some cases, it causes pneumonia (lung
infection) and other infections. If left untreated, MRSA infections can become
severe and cause sepsis--the body's extreme response to an infection.

##### **In Healthcare Settings**

In places such as a hospital or nursing home, MRSA can cause severe problems
such as

Who is at risk?

Anyone can get MRSA. The risk increases with activities or places that involve
crowding, skin-to-skin contact, and shared equipment or supplies. Some of the
people who carry MRSA can go on to get a MRSA infection. Non-intact skin, such
as when there are abrasions or incisions, is often the site of an MRSA
infection. Athletes, daycare and school students, military personnel in
barracks, and those who receive inpatient medical care or have surgery or
medical devices inserted in their body are at higher risk of MRSA infection.

How is MRSA spread in the community?

MRSA is usually spread in the community by contact with infected people or
things that are carrying the bacteria. This includes through contact with a
contaminated wound or by sharing personal items, such as towels or razors,
that have touched infected skin.

The opioid epidemic may also be connected to the rise of staph infections in
communities. People who inject drugs are 16 times more likely to develop a
serious staph infection.

What are symptoms of MRSA Infection?

The symptoms of a MRSA infection depend on the part of the body that is
infected. For example, people with MRSA skin infections often can get
swelling, warmth, redness, and pain in infected skin. In most cases it is hard
to tell if an infection is due to MRSA or another type of bacteria without
laboratory tests that your doctor can order. Some MRSA skin infections can
have a fairly typical appearance and can be confused with a spider bite.
However, unless you actually see the spider, the irritation is likely not a
spider bite.

Most  _S. aureus_  skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or
infected area on the skin that might be:

What if I see these symptoms?

Getting medical care early makes it less likely that the infection will become
serious.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Contact your healthcare provider, especially if the symptoms are accompanied by a fever.
