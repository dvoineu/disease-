## Summary

The adrenal glands are small glands located on top of each kidney. They
produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and
cortisol. Cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important
functions.

With adrenal gland disorders, your glands make too much or not enough
hormones. In Cushing's syndrome, there's too much cortisol, while with
Addison's disease, there is too little. Some people are born unable to make
enough cortisol.

Causes of adrenal gland disorders include

    * Genetic mutations
    * Tumors including pheochromocytomas
    * Infections
    * A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary, which helps to regulate the adrenal gland
    * Certain medicines

Treatment depends on which problem you have. Surgery or medicines can treat
many adrenal gland disorders.
