## Summary

Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood, urine, or body tissues. A
technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results
fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal
differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These include

  * Your sex, age and race
  * What you eat and drink
  * Medicines you take
  * How well you followed pre-test instructions

Your doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests.
Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in
your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions, plan or
evaluate treatments, and monitor diseases.
