## Summary

Our senses of taste and smell give us great pleasure. Taste helps us enjoy
food and beverages. Smell lets us enjoy the scents and fragrances like roses
or coffee. Taste and smell also protect us, letting us know when food has gone
bad or when there is a gas leak. They make us want to eat, ensuring we get the
nutrition we need.

People with taste disorders may taste things that aren't there, may not be
able to tell the difference in tastes, or can't taste at all. People with
smell disorders may lose their sense of smell, or things may smell different.
A smell they once enjoyed may now smell bad to them.

Many illnesses and injuries can cause taste and smell disorders, including
colds and head injuries. Some drugs can also affect taste and smell. Most
people lose some ability to taste and smell as they get older. Treatment
varies, depending on the problem and its cause.
