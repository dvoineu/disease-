The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence
of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use
among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating
both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.

NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey
of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50
states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at
both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide
national estimates for subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

NATS is the first adult tobacco survey designed within the framework provided
by the Office of Smoking and Health's Key Outcome Indicators (KOI) report. The
NATS questionnaire is built around KOI from each of the following four goal
areas:
