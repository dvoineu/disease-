## Summary

An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy. It uses medicine or surgery to
remove the embryo or fetus and placenta from the uterus. The procedure is done
by a licensed health care professional.

The decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. If you are thinking of
having an abortion, most health care providers advise counseling.
