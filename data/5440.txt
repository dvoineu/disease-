Ringworm is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches
of ringworm on the skin at once. The medical name for ringworm is tinea.

## Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. But, it can affect people of
all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria, fungi, and yeast live on your body. Some of these are useful,
while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus grows
and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can spread from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you
touch someone who has the infection, or if you come in contact with items
contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or
pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets. Cats are common
carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more
likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries
to your skin, scalp, or nails.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    * Beard, tinea barbae
    * Body, tinea corporis
    * Feet, tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot)
    * Groin area, tinea cruris (also called jock itch)
    * Scalp, tinea capitis

## Alternative Names

Dermatophytid; Dermatophyte fungal infection - tinea; Tinea
