## Overview

The cardiac conduction system is a group of specialized cardiac muscle cells
in the walls of the heart that send signals to the heart muscle causing it to
contract. The main components of the cardiac conduction system are the SA
node, AV node, bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. The SA
node (anatomical pacemaker) starts the sequence by causing the atrial muscles
to contract. From there, the signal travels to the AV node, through the bundle
of His, down the bundle branches, and through the Purkinje fibers, causing the
ventricles to contract. This signal creates an electrical current that can be
seen on a graph called an Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). Doctors use an EKG
to monitor the cardiac conduction system's electrical activity in the heart.
