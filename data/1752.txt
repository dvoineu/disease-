## Most Americans Should Consume Less Sodium

![Vital Signs: Reducing Sodium in Children's
Diet](/salt/images/vs_children_info.jpg)

Click on the infographic to view it and other infographics related to children
and reducing sodium in their diet.

Most of the sodium we consume is in the form of salt, and the vast majority of
sodium we consume is in processed and restaurant foods. Your body needs a
small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your
health. Excess sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for heart
disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans
each year than any other cause.1

### Reducing Sodium in Children's Diets

Nearly 9 in 10 US children eat more sodium than recommended, and about 1 in 9
children has raised blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart
disease and stroke. Lowering sodium in children's diets today can help prevent
heart disease tomorrow. Small changes make a big impact on your child's daily
sodium intake.

Sources of Sodium

Americans get 71% of their daily sodium from processed and restaurant foods.2
What is processed food?

Sodium is already in processed and restaurant foods when you purchase them,
which makes it difficult to reduce daily sodium intake on your own. Although
it is wise to limit your use of added table salt while cooking and at the
table, only a small amount of the sodium we consume each day comes from the
salt shaker.

Balancing Act: Sodium and Potassium

Did you know that sodium and potassium both affect blood pressure? In general,
people who reduce sodium, who increase potassium, or who do both benefit from
having lower blood pressure and reducing their risk for other serious health
problems. Eating enough potassium each day can help balance out some of the
harmful effects that high sodium intake can have on blood pressure. But
lowering sodium intake is key to this balance.

CDC's Sodium Reduction Initiative

CDC is working at the national, state, and local levels to help reduce sodium
in the food supply. CDC's approach to sodium reduction includes supporting and
evaluating ongoing initiatives to reduce sodium, providing technical
assistance to the public health community, expanding the scientific literature
related to sodium reduction, collaborating with stakeholders, and educating
the public. Learn more about CDC's Sodium Reduction Initiative.

Dietary Guidelines for Sodium

The _2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans_ external icon recommend that
Americans consume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day as part of
a healthy eating pattern.

Nearly everyone benefits from lower sodium intake. Learn more about who
benefits in a recent CDC report.

Sodium Reduction Targets

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released draft, voluntary
sodium reduction targetsexternal icon for processed and prepared foods. This
new guidance lays out achievable short-term and long-term goals for sodium
reduction in about 150 categories of food. To learn more about sodium
reduction, read the article in the _Journal of the American Medical
Association_ external icon ( _JAMA_ ). For more information about the science
supporting sodium reduction and why accurate measurement matters, read the
_New England Journal of Medicine external icon_ ( _NEJM_ ) article.
