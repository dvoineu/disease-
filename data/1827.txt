## Summary

The esophagus is a hollow tube that carries food and liquids from your throat
to your stomach. Early esophageal cancer usually does not cause symptoms.
Later, you may have symptoms such as

    * Painful or difficult swallowing
    * Weight loss
    * A hoarse voice or cough that doesn't go away

You're at greater risk for getting esophageal cancer if you smoke, drink
heavily, or have acid reflux. Your risk also goes up as you age

Your doctor uses imaging tests and a biopsy to diagnose esophageal cancer.
Treatments include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. You might also need
nutritional support, since the cancer or treatment may make it hard to
swallow.
