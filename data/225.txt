## Summary

Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through
unusual mood changes. They go from very happy, "up," and active to very sad
and hopeless, "down," and inactive, and then back again. They often have
normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is
depression.

The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families.
Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role.

Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years.
But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually
lasts a lifetime.

If you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. A medical
checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.

If not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job
or school performance, and even suicide. However, there are effective
treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. A combination
usually works best.
