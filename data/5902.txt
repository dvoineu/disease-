**CDC 's Safe Water Program** protects public health through non-regulatory
actions that decrease environmental threats to water systems and reduce
people's exposures to waterborne contaminants. State, territorial, local, and
tribal (STLT) health officials rely on CDC for specialized expertise and
resources that would otherwise not be available to address water contamination
and/or waterborne illness.

**Harmful Algal Bloom in Ohio**  
During a harmful algal bloom that affected Lake Erie, public health officials
from Toledo, Ohio, contacted CDC for guidance to protect the 500,000 people
who get their drinking water from the lake. Harmful algal blooms may result in
sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, and neurological damage at high
concentrations. CDC provided the state with tools to support their response,
including reference cards for physicians and veterinarians, a poster about
protecting animal health, and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document
about cyanobacteria. CDC also provided data collection forms and an event-
specific FAQ, which helped the city improve their response to and minimize the
potential health impact from the bloom.

**Changing Policy in Iowa to Prevent Arsenic Exposure in Drinking Water from
Private Wells**  
Iowa's Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health has been working with
CDC for the last 5 years to protect the health of residents who may be exposed
to arsenic in private well water. Ingesting very high levels of arsenic can
result in death. Arsenic is associated with health effects such as heart
disease and lung, bladder, and skin cancer. Local officials tested water and
rock chip samples from more than 60 wells and determined the arsenic source
was pyrite. Local environmental health supervisors then classified the entire
county as an arsenic zone and approved an ordinance to require well testing to
reduce risk for exposure to high arsenic levels in wells. They also worked
with well drillers to change well construction practices to prevent arsenic
exposure. Additionally, the state updated rules contained in the Grants-To-
Counties Program to reimburse residents for arsenic testing in private wells.
These efforts benefit 450,000 private well users in Iowa.

**Reducing Hazards at Public Pools through the Model Aquatic Health Code**  
There is no federal regulatory authority for public pools, waterparks, and
interactive fountains. Yet significant hazards exist. Drowning is a leading
cause of unintentional injury-related death for children, pool chemicals cause
5,000 emergency department visits each year, and outbreaks associated with
public pools have increased dramatically from an average of 12 a year
(1991-1995) to 41 (2006-2010).

State and/or local officials develop codes for these facilities, and
inspecting them is the third most-common inspection service provided by local
health departments. Maintaining and updating codes requires a great deal of
time and resources, so health departments and industry asked CDC to create a
model code based on best practices and latest scientific research.

In response, CDC worked with academia, public health, and industry to create
the Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). The MAHC is a voluntary set of
guidelines agencies can use to create or update existing pool codes and reduce
outbreaks, drownings, and chemical poisoning at public aquatic facilities. It
is not a federal law and only becomes law if adopted by a state or locality.
Agencies can use all, none, or some of the MAHC and can modify it to fit their
local needs.
