## Summary

Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest
food, store energy, and remove poisons. You cannot live without a liver that
works. If your liver fails, your doctor may put you on a waiting list for a
liver transplant. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment cannot
keep a damaged liver working.

During a liver transplantation, the surgeon removes the diseased liver and
replaces it with a healthy one. Most transplant livers come from a donor who
has died. Sometimes there is a living donor. This is when a healthy person
donates part of his or her liver for a specific patient.

The most common reason for a transplant in adults is cirrhosis. This is
scarring of the liver, caused by injury or long-term disease. The most common
reason in children is biliary atresia, a disease of the bile ducts.

If you have a transplant, you must take drugs the rest of your life to help
keep your body from rejecting the new liver.
