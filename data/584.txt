## Summary

Menstruation, or period, is a woman's monthly bleeding.Abnormal vaginal
bleeding is different from normal menstrual periods. It could be bleeding that
is between periods, is very heavy, or lasts much longer than usual. It also
includes bleeding that happens before puberty or after menopause. Causes can
include

    * Uterine fibroids or polyps
    * Hormone problems
    * Hormone pills, such as birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy (menopausal hormone therapy)
    * Cancer of the cervix, ovaries, uterus or vagina
    * Thyroid problems

Bleeding during pregnancy can have several different causes. It is not always
serious, but to be safe you should contact your health care provider right
away.

Pelvic exams, blood tests, imaging tests, and other procedures can help your
health care provider diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.
Treatments may include medicines, hormones, and surgery.
