## Summary

Although breast cancer is much more common in women, men can get it too. It
happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70.

Breast lumps usually aren't cancer. However, most men with breast cancer have
lumps. Other breast symptoms can include

  * Dimpled or puckered skin
  * A red, scaly nipple or skin
  * Fluid discharge

Risk factors for male breast cancer include exposure to radiation, a family
history of breast cancer, and having high estrogen levels, which can happen
with diseases like cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.

Treatment for male breast cancer is usually a mastectomy, which is surgery to
remove the breast. Other treatments include radiation, chemotherapy and/or
hormone therapy.
