## Summary

### What are adenoids?

Adenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat, just behind the
nose. They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The
lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The
adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and
nose.

Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they
are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.

### What are enlarged adenoids?

Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in
children.

### What causes enlarged adenoids?

Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It
may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also
become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might
stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.

### What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?

Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose. Your child
might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause

    * A dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breath
    * Cracked lips
    * A runny nose

Other problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include

    * Loud breathing
    * Snoring
    * Restless sleep
    * Sleep apnea, where you repeatedly stop breathing for a few seconds while sleeping
    * Ear infections

### How can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?

Your child's health care provider will take a medical history, check your
child's ears, throat, and mouth, and feel your child's neck.

Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the health care provider
cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth. To check the size
of your child's adenoids, your provider may use

    * A special mirror in the mouth
    * A long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)
    * An x-ray

### What are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?

The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If your child's symptoms
are not too bad, he or she may not need treatment. Your child might get nasal
spray to reduce the swelling, or antibiotics if the health care provider
thinks that your child has a bacterial infection.

In some cases your child may need an adenoidectomy.

### What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?

An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. Your child might need it
if

    * He or she has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.
    * Antibiotics can't get rid of a bacterial infection
    * The enlarged adenoids block the airways

If your child also has problems with his or her tonsils, he or she will
probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that
the adenoids are removed.

After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. He or she
will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take
several days to feel all better.
