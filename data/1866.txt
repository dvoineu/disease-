## Summary

You use your fingers and thumbs to do everything from grasping objects to
playing musical instruments to typing. When there is something wrong with
them, it can make life difficult. Common problems include

    * Injuries that result in fractures (broken bones), ruptured ligaments and dislocations
    * Osteoarthritis \- wear-and-tear arthritis. It can also cause deformity.
    * Tendinitis \- irritation of the tendons
    * Dupuytren's contracture - a hereditary thickening of the tough tissue that lies just below the skin of your palm. It causes the fingers to stiffen and bend.
    * Trigger finger - an irritation of the sheath that surrounds the flexor tendons. It can cause the tendon to catch and release like a trigger.
