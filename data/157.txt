#  Winter Weather Emergencies

## Summary

### What kinds of problems can severe winter weather cause?

Winter storms can bring extreme cold, freezing rain, snow, ice, and high
winds. Staying safe and warm can be a challenge. You may have to cope with
problems such as

  * Cold-related health problems, including frostbite and hypothermia
  * Household fires and carbon monoxide poisoning from space heaters and fireplaces
  * Unsafe driving conditions from icy roads
  * Power failures and loss of communication
  * Floods after the snow and ice melt

### How can I prepare for a winter weather emergency?

If there is a winter storm coming, there are things you can do to try to keep
yourself and your loved ones safe:

  * Have a disaster plan which includes
    * Making sure that you have important phone numbers, including for your health care providers, pharmacy, and veterinarian
    * Having a communication plan for your family
    * Knowing how to get reliable information during the storm
  * Prepare your home to keep out the cold with insulation, caulking, and weather stripping. Learn how to keep pipes from freezing.
  * Gather supplies in case you need to stay home for several days without power
  * If you plan to use your fireplace or wood stove for emergency heating, have your chimney or flue inspected each year
  * Install a smoke detector and a battery-operated carbon monoxide detector
  * If you have to travel, be sure you have an emergency car kit with some basic supplies like
    * An ice scraper
    * A shovel
    * Cat litter or sand for better tire traction 
    * Water and snacks
    * Extra warm clothing
    * Jumper cables
    * First aid kit with any necessary medicines and a pocket knife
    * A battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries
    * Emergency flares or distress flags
    * Waterproof matches and a can to melt snow for water

If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need
help in finding ways to cope.
