A pelvis x-ray is a picture of the bones around both the hips. The pelvis
connects the legs to the body.

## How the Test is Performed

The test is done in a radiology department or in the health care provider's
office by an x-ray technician.

You will lie down on the table. The pictures are then taken. You may have to
move your body to other positions to provide different views.

## How to Prepare for the Test

Tell the provider if you are pregnant. Remove all jewelry, especially around
your belly and legs. You will wear a hospital gown.

## How the Test will Feel

The x-rays are painless. Changing position may cause discomfort.

## Why the Test is Performed

The x-ray is used to look for:

    * Fractures
    * Tumors
    * Degenerative conditions of bones in the hips, pelvis, and upper legs

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may suggest:

    * Pelvic fractures
    * Arthritis of the hip joint
    * Tumors of the bones of the pelvis
    * Sacroiliitis (inflammation of the area where the sacrum joins the ilium bone)
    * Ankylosing spondylitis (abnormal stiffness of the spine and joint)
    * Arthritis of the lower spine
    * Abnormality of the shape of your pelvis or hip joint

## Risks

Children and the fetuses of pregnant women are more sensitive to the risks of
the x-ray. A protective shield may be worn over areas not being scanned.

## Alternative Names

X-ray - pelvis
