CDC works closely with state and local public health departments, travel
industry partners, and others to identify and test people who may be infected
with MERS-CoV. CDC conducts several different laboratory tests to detect MERS-
CoV infection.

In general, these lab tests fall into two categories:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Molecular tests, which look for evidence of active infection; and

Serology tests are for surveillance or investigational purposes and not for diagnostic purposes.

## Molecular Tests

Molecular tests are used to diagnose **active infection** (presence of MERS-
CoV) in people who are thought to be infected with MERS-CoV based on their
clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS has been reported.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are molecular tests that can be used to detect viral RNA in clinical samples. CDC's current case definition for laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection requires either a positive rRT-PCR result for at least two specific genomic targets, or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target.

This test is done under authority of an Emergency Use Authorization because there are no FDA-cleared/approved tests available for this purpose in the United States.

For this rRT-PCR assay, CDC recommends collecting multiple specimens, including lower (bronchalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates) and upper (e.g., nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) respiratory samples, serum, and stool specimens.

Since a single negative result does not completely rule out MERS-CoV infection, in some circumstances additional specimens may be tested.

## Serology Tests

Serology testing is used to detect **previous infection** (antibodies to MERS-
CoV) in people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proteins
produced by the body's immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and
other microbes during infection. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV
indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus and
developed an immune response.

For example, public health investigators have identified individuals who are PCR-positive but have no MERS symptoms; we do not know if MERS-CoV can be spread by these people. For this reason, public health scientists are working to learn more about how the virus is transmitted. One way to do this is through voluntary testing of blood samples from people who had close contact with people known to have MERS.

This method is considered a gold standard for detection of specific antibodies in serum samples. However, compared with the ELISA, the microneutralization assay is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring at least 5 days before results are available.
