A novel influenza A virus is one that has caused human infection, but is
different from current seasonal human influenza A viruses that circulate among
people. Novel influenza A viruses are usually influenza A viruses that
circulate among animals. Some novel influenza A viruses are believed to pose a
greater pandemic threat than others and are more concerning to public health
officials because they have caused serious human illness and death and also
have been able to spread in a limited manner from person-to-person. Novel
influenza A viruses are of extra concern because of the potential impact they
could have on public health if they gain the ability to spread easily from
person to person, which might cause the next influenza pandemic. Human
infection with a novel influenza A virus is a nationally notifiable condition
reportable to CDC. The text below summarizes the novel influenza A viruses
that are currently most concerning to public health officials.

(HPAI H5 viruses detected in birds and poultry in the United States are different and have not caused human infections.)

The first human infections with H7N9 viruses were reported by WHO on April 1, 2013external icon and sporadic human infections continue to be reported in China. In late 2016, some low pathogenicity Asian H7N9 viruses developed mutations that made them highly pathogenic in poultry. These HPAI H7N9 Asian viruses continue to be associated with human infections in China. Many Asian H7N9 virus infected patients have had severe respiratory illness. During the past five annual epidemics of Asian H7N9 virus infections in people, the mortality rate in hospitalized patients has averaged about 40 percent. Probable, limited, non-sustained human-to-human spread of Asian H7N9 viruses also has been reported in China. Since the implementation of a large-scale H5-H7 poultry vaccination program in September 2017, few human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses have been reported.

Cases of Asian H7N9 virus infection associated with travel to China also have been reported in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia.

When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." They also can be denoted by adding the letter "v" to the end of the influenza A virus subtype designation.

Like seasonal influenza, however, serious illness, resulting in hospitalization and death, is possible. In general, variant viruses have been associated with less severe illness and much lower mortality than human infection with avian influenza A viruses.

### Risk Assessment

CDC and non-CDC influenza experts have developed a tool that assesses the
potential pandemic risk posed by novel influenza A viruses. Influenza Risk
Assessment Tool results are summarized in a table.
