Outbreak Summary

#### Introduction

CDC collaborated with public health and agriculture officials in many states
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine
(FDA-CVM) to investigate eight outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections
linked to exposure to turtles and their environments. Public health
investigators used the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that were
part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public
health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA
"fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria are obtained through diagnostic
testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of
illness that were part of this outbreak. Outbreak strains were defined by PFGE
pattern and serotype.

A total of 473 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ were
reported from 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: Alabama
(4), Alaska (2), Arizona (27), Arkansas (4), California (106), Colorado (6),
Connecticut (1), Delaware (4), Florida (1), Georgia (10), Illinois (10),
Indiana (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (3), Louisiana (5), Maine (1), Maryland
(17), Massachusetts (12), Michigan (5), Minnesota (1), Mississippi (4),
Missouri (4), Nevada (11), New Jersey (26), New Mexico (15), New York (55),
North Carolina (3), Ohio (6), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (34), Puerto Rico (1),
Rhode Island (1), South Carolina (17), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (7), Texas
(45), Utah (1), Vermont (1), Virginia (5), Washington (5), Washington, D.C.
(3), Wisconsin (2) and West Virginia (3).

Among 473 persons, reported and estimated illness onset dates ranged from May
23, 2011, to September 9, 2013. Among 462 persons for whom information was
available, ill persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 94 years, with a
median age of 4 years. Seventy percent of ill persons were children 10 years
of age or younger, and 31% of ill persons were children 1 year of age or
younger. Fifty-five percent of ill persons were female. Among 192 persons for
whom information was available, 85 (44%) ill persons were of Hispanic
ethnicity. Information about the association between reptiles and _Salmonella_
is available in Spanish. Among 272 persons with available information, 78
(29%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

The numbers of new cases have declined substantially since the peak of the
outbreak,  which occurred from July 2012 to September 2012, but illnesses are
still being reported among people who have contact with small turtles. The
outbreak is expected to continue at a low level for the next several months
since consumers might be unaware of the risk of _Salmonella_ infection from
reptiles including small turtles. If properly cared for, small turtles have a
long life expectancy.

Turtles of any size, as well as other reptiles and amphibians, can be a source
of human _Salmonella_ infections. However, small turtles have been linked to
more outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections than other pet reptiles and
amphibians. More information about _Salmonella_ from reptiles and amphibians
and the steps people can take to reduce their risk of infection is available.

#### Investigation of the Outbreaks

Epidemiologic, environmental, and traceback investigations conducted by
officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and
regulatory agencies linked these outbreaks to exposure to turtles and their
environments.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and
foods eaten during the week before becoming ill. One hundred and eighty-seven
(69%) of 272 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before
becoming ill. Of the 141 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtle
with which they had contact, 124 (88%) specifically reported exposure to
turtles with shell length less than 4 inches. Fifty-five (80%) of 70 ill
persons recalled contact with red eared slider turtles, which are commonly
owned as pets. Other types of pet turtles such as yellow bellied sliders and
mud turtles were also reported by ill people, however in many cases the
specific type of turtle was not known.

One hundred and sixteen ill persons reported where they acquired their small
turtle. The most common source of small turtle purchase was street vendors,
reported by 36 (31%) patients. Turtles were purchased from multiple other
sources, including pet stores [21 (18%)], flea markets [14 (12%)], discount
stores [8 (7%)], souvenir/gift shops [6 (5%)], other stores [4 (3%)], and
online [3 (3%)]. Nineteen (16%) patients received small turtles as gifts, and
5 (4%) patients acquired turtles from a carnival, car show, fair, festival, or
swap meet.

State and local public health departments and regulatory agencies collected
swab samples from turtles and turtle tank water from turtle habitats at ill
persons' homes and at retail establishments where ill persons reported
purchasing turtles. _Salmonella_ with patterns matching outbreak strains were
identified from ill persons' turtles or turtle habitats in seven of the eight
outbreaks: outbreaks 1-6 and outbreak 8.  Turtle tank samples from retail
stores where turtles in outbreaks 3 and 6 were purchased yielded the outbreak
3 and outbreak 6 strains, respectively. In four outbreaks, turtle tank water
yielded one or more outbreak strains.

Information provided by ill persons infected in several outbreaks was used by
investigators from multiple state public health and agriculture agencies and
FDA to trace the small turtles in ill persons' households to retail
establishments, turtle brokers, and eventually turtle farms. Traceback
investigations of turtles purchased from Florida souvenir shops identified two
turtle farms in Louisiana as the source of the turtles. The Florida Department
of Health and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have
collaborated to stop the sale of turtles with a shell length of less than 4
inches from these shops. _Salmonella_ with patterns matching outbreak strains
2 and 3 were identified from a turtle pond at one of the Louisiana turtle
farms. The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued cease and
desist orders in March 2013 for the source farms; therefore, turtles with a
shell length of less than 4 inches from these farms are no longer being sold
domestically.  The source of turtles in other outbreaks could not be
identified because of the challenges of tracing small turtles that are sold
illegally by transient vendors.

May 24, 2013

#### Investigation Overview

Four of the eight multistate outbreaks remain under active investigation and
updates for these outbreaks are listed below. The outbreaks are numbered in
the order in which they were identified. Turtles are an important cause of
human _Salmonella_ infections in the United States, particularly in infants
and young children. More information about _Salmonella_ , and steps people can
take to reduce their risk of infection, can be found on the CDC _Salmonella_
Web Page.

Illnesses that occurred after April 12, 2013 might not yet be reported due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported. For more details, please see _Salmonella_ Outbreak Investigations:
Timeline for Reporting Cases.



#### Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain A and _Salmonella_ Newport,
Strain A

#### Case Count Update

Illness onset dates range from August 3, 2011 to May 6, 2013. Ill persons
range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 6 years.
Sixty-three percent of ill persons are female. Ethnicity was reported for 38
ill persons, and of these, 27 (71%) were Hispanic. Among 60 persons with
available information, 13 (22%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have
been reported.



#### Outbreak 2: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain A

#### Final Case Count Update

A total of 19 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Pomona, strain A were
reported from 11 states.

Illness onset dates ranged from December 9, 2011 to January 22, 2013. Ill
persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of
4 years. Sixty-three percent of ill persons were female. Ethnicity information
was available for 8 ill persons; of these, 5 (63%) were Hispanic. Among 15
persons with available information, 4 (27%) reported being hospitalized. No
deaths were reported.

This outbreak appears to be over. However, turtles are an important cause of
human _Salmonella_ infections in the United States. More information about
_Salmonella_ from reptiles and amphibians, and the steps people can take to
reduce their risk of infection is available.



#### Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain A and _Salmonella_ Sandiego,
Strain C

#### Case Count Update

A total of 55 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Poona, strain A and
_Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain C have been reported from 22 states.  Illness
onset dates range from October 20, 2011 to January 28, 2013. Ill persons range

six percent of ill persons are female. Ethnicity information is currently
available for 18 ill persons; of these, 3 (17%) are Hispanic. Among 35 persons
with available information, 12 (34%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

#### Investigation Update

Traceback investigations of turtles purchased from Florida souvenir shops
identified two turtle farms in Louisiana as the source of the turtles. The
Florida Department of Health and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission have collaborated to stop the sale of turtles with a shell length
of less than 4 inches from these shops.

The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued cease and desist
orders in March 2013 for the source farms; therefore, turtles with a shell
length of less than 4 inches from these farms are no longer being sold
domestically.

No new ill persons in Outbreak 3 have been reported since February 2013;
however, this outbreak investigation remains open because investigations of
the Louisiana turtle farms are ongoing.

This outbreak appears to be over. However, turtles are an important cause of
human _Salmonella_ infections in the United States. More information about
_Salmonella_ from reptiles and amphibians, and the steps people can take to
reduce their risk of infection, is available.

#### Final Investigation Update

Among the 24 ill persons with information available, 15 (63%) reported
exposure to turtles before they became ill. Eight ill persons reported the
size of the turtle they had contact with, and all 8 (100%) described turtles
with a shell length of less than 4 inches.

#### Investigation Overview

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians
(such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human _Salmonella_ infections.
Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known
source of human _Salmonella_ infections, especially among young children.
Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the
sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can
carry _Salmonella_ germs and still appear healthy and clean. _Salmonella_
germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and
anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live
in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread
to people.

CDC continues to collaborate with public health officials in multiple states
and the FDA to investigate 8 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human
_Salmonella_ infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments
(e.g., water from a turtle habitat). Because the majority of ill persons who
reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street
vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_
bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of
these outbreaks. Using this method, a total of 347 persons infected with the
outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Newport, Pomona, Poona, I
4,[5],12:i:-, and Typhimurium have been reported from 37 states and the
District of Columbia in overlapping, multistate outbreaks linked to contact
with small turtles and their habitats. Twenty-eight percent of ill persons
have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Seventy percent of
ill persons are children 10 years of age or younger, and 33% of ill persons
are children 1 year of age or younger. Forty-four percent of ill persons are
of Hispanic ethnicity.

Results of the epidemiologic and environmental investigations indicate
exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat)
is the source of these outbreaks. Seventy percent of ill persons reported
exposure to turtles prior to their illness. Ninety percent of ill persons with
turtle exposure specifically reported exposure to small turtles. Thirty-three
percent of ill persons with small turtles reported purchasing the turtles from
street vendors, and 11% reported purchasing small turtles from pet stores.
Illnesses that occurred after January 3, 2013 might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported. For more details, please see _Salmonella_ Outbreak Investigations:
Timeline for Reporting Cases.

The 8 multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to small
turtles are numbered in the order in which they were identified. The details
of each investigation are described below.

for whom ethnicity was reported is not Hispanic.

June 28, 2012

#### Investigation Overview

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians
(such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human _Salmonella_ infections.
Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known
source of human _Salmonella_ infections, especially among young children.
Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the
sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can
carry _Salmonella_ germs and still appear healthy and clean. _Salmonella_
germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and
anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live
in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread
to people.

CDC continues to collaborate with public health officials in multiple states
and the FDA to investigate 6 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human
_Salmonella_ infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments
(e.g., water from a turtle habitat). Because the majority of ill persons who
reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street
vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.

The 6 multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to small
turtles are numbered in the order in which they were identified. The details
of each investigation are described below.



#### Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain A and _Salmonella_ Newport,
Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 62 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A, and
_Salmonella_ Newport, strain A, have been reported from 15 states. One ill
person infected with _Salmonella_ Newport was included in the case count based
on epidemiologic and laboratory evidence linking them with this outbreak. The
7 new cases are from California (3), New Mexico (1), Nevada (1), and Texas
(2).

Illness onset dates range from August 3, 2011 to May 24, 2012. Ill persons
range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 8 years.
Sixty-one percent of patients are female. Among 44 persons with available
information, 10 (23%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Illnesses that occurred after April 24, 2012 might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Investigation Update

Among the 47 ill persons for whom information is available, 36 (77%) reported
contact with turtles before becoming ill. Twenty-six persons who reported
contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; of these, 25 (96%)
reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches. Among those
reporting small turtles, 10 (45%) of the 22 with information available were
exposed to turtles purchased from a street vendor. Of the 11 ill persons who
reported the type of turtle they had contact with, 10 (91%) reported contact
with red-eared slider turtles.

#### Environmental Sampling Update

_Salmonella_ Newport, strain A, was isolated from turtle tank water from the
household of an ill person infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A.



#### Outbreak 2: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 11 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Pomona, strain A, have

range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 16 years.
Seventy-three percent of patients are female. Among 10 persons with available
information, 3 (30%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Illnesses that occurred after May 22, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.



#### Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 17 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_
Poona have been reported from 9 states. The 2 new cases are from Tennessee (1)
and Texas (1).

Illness onset dates range from October 20, 2011 to April 6, 2012. Ill persons
range in age from less than 1 year to 70 years, with a median age of 3 years.
Sixty-nine percent of patients are female. Among 12 persons with available
information, 4 (33%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Illnesses that occurred after May 2, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Environmental Sampling Update

In May 2012, two samples of turtle tank water from the home of an ill person
in New York yielded the outbreak strain _Salmonella_ Poona, strain A.



#### Outbreak 4: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain B

#### Case Count Update

No new cases have been reported since the prior update on May 10, 2012.
Illnesses that occurred after June 9, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Environmental Sampling Update

In May 2012, turtle tank water obtained in the home of two ill persons from
the same Nevada household yielded the outbreak strain, _Salmonella_ Sandiego,
strain B.



#### Outbreak 5: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain B

A total of 47 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Pomona, strain B, have
been reported from 18 states. The 8 new cases are from Alabama (1), Arizona
(1), California (2), Nevada (1), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (1), and Texas
(1).

Illness onset dates range from June 21, 2011 to June 16, 2012. Ill persons
range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 2 years.
Forty-nine percent of patients are female. Among 30 persons with available
information, 9 (30%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Illnesses that occurred after May 26, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Investigation Update

Among the 30 ill persons with available information, 19 (63%) reported contact
with turtles in the week before becoming ill. Seven ill persons who reported
contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; all 7 of these
persons (100%) reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches.
Four (57%) of the 7 ill persons who had contact with small turtles reported
buying their turtles from a street vendor.



#### Outbreak 6: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain B, Initial Investigation
Announcement

As of June 25, 2012, a total of 6 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Poona
have been reported from 3 states. The number of ill persons identified in each
state is as follows: Arizona (1), Pennsylvania (4), and Texas (1).

Illness onset dates range from April 1, 2012 to May 26, 2012. Infected
individuals range in age from less than 1 year to 74 years, with a median age
of 8 years. Fifty percent of patients are female. The 1 patient with available
information has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Among the 4 ill persons with information available, 3 (75%) reported exposure
to turtles before they became ill. Three ill persons reported the size of the
turtle they had contact with, and 3 (100%) described turtles with a shell
length of less than 4 inches. Three ill persons who had contact with small
turtles reported where they purchased the turtles, and 3 (100%) purchased the
turtles from a street vendor.

In May 2012, samples of turtle tank water from a pet store where two ill
persons from the same Pennsylvania household purchased small turtles yielded
the outbreak strain, _Salmonella_ Poona, strain B. Also in May 2012,
_Salmonella_ Poona, strain B (the Outbreak 6 strain) was identified in turtle
tank water from a pet store where a Delaware person infected with _Salmonella_
Pomona, strain B (the Outbreak 5 strain) had purchased small turtles.

Illnesses that occurred after June 1, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Investigation Overview

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians
(such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human _Salmonella_ infections.
Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known

_Salmonella_ infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments
(e.g., water from a turtle habitat). Because the majority of ill persons who
reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street
vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.

The 5 multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to small
turtles are numbered in the order in which they were identified. The details
of each investigation are described below.



#### Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 55 individuals infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A have
been reported from 13 states. The 5 new cases are from Illinois (1), New
Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (1), and South Carolina (1).

Illnesses began between August 3, 2011 and April 16, 2012. Ill persons range
in age from less than 1 to 86 years, with a median age of 7 years. Sixty-two
percent of patients are female. Among 39 persons with available information,
10 (25%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after March 19, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Investigation Update

Among the 41 ill persons for whom information is available, 32 (78%) reported
contact with turtles before becoming ill. Twenty-two persons who reported
contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; of these, 21 (95%)
reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches. Among those
reporting small turtles, 8 (42%) of the 19 with information available were
exposed to turtles purchased from a street vendor. Of the 9 ill persons who
reported the type of turtle they had contact with, 8 (89%) reported red-eared
slider turtles.

#### Environmental Sampling Update

In March 2012, samples of turtle tank water and turtles from the homes of 2
ill persons in New York yielded the outbreak strain, _Salmonella_ Sandiego,
strain A.



#### Outbreak 2: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

No new cases have been reported since the March 30, 2012 investigation
announcement. Among the 9 cases, 3 (33%) have been hospitalized. Illnesses
that occurred after March 28, 2012 might not be reported yet due to the time
it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

#### Investigation Update

Among the 5 ill persons who reported contact with turtles before becoming ill,
3 (63%) described the size of the turtle they had contact with. All 3 (100%)
identified turtles with shell length of less than 4 inches.

#### Environmental Sampling Update

In March 2012, one sample of turtle tank water from the home of a person in
New York who was infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A yielded 2
outbreak strains. These strains were _Salmonella_ Pomona, strain A and
_Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A. This suggests that the turtles causing
Outbreak 1 and Outbreak 2 may originate from a common source.



#### Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 15 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_
Poona have been reported from 8 states. The 3 new cases are from Alabama (1),
New York (1), and Texas (1).

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range
from October 20, 2011 to April 6, 2012. Ill persons range in age from less
than 1 year to 70 years, with a median age of 3 years. Sixty-seven percent of
patients are female. Among 11 persons with available information, 3 (27%)
reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after March 18, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

#### Investigation Update

Among the 14 ill persons with available information, 12 (86%) reported contact
with turtles in the week before becoming ill. Eight persons who reported
contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; of these, 6 (75%)
reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches. Three (50%) of
the 6 ill persons who had contact with small turtles reported buying their
turtles from a street vendor. Of the 8 ill persons who could recall the type
of turtle with which they had contact, 7 (88%) reported red-eared slider
turtles.



#### Outbreak 4: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain B Initial Investigation
Announcement

As of May 8, 2012, a total of 6 individuals infected with _Salmonella_
Sandiego, strain B have been reported from 3 states. The number of ill persons
identified in each state is as follows: Colorado (3), Nevada (2), and Texas
(1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began
between February 25 and April 27, 2012. Infected individuals range in age from
less than 1 year old to 65 years old, and the median age is 17 years. Fifty
percent of patients are female. Among the 6 ill persons, 1 (17%) has been
hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and
foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Four (67%) of 6 ill
persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Four
persons who reported contact with turtles also reported the size of the
turtle, 4 (100%) reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches
and 4 (100%) identified red-eared slider turtles. Four ill persons who
reported contact with small turtles also reported where the turtle was
purchased. Two purchased turtles from pet stores, one purchased a turtle from
a street vendor, and 1 purchased a turtle from a flea market.

In April 2012, one sample of water from a turtle habitat associated with an
ill person in Colorado who was infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain B
was tested. This sample yielded the outbreak strain, _Salmonella_ Sandiego,
strain B.

Illnesses that occurred after April 20, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.



#### Outbreak 5: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain B Initial Investigation
Announcement

As of May 8, 2012, a total of 39 individuals infected with _Salmonella_
Pomona, strain B have been reported from 16 states. The number of ill persons
identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (2), Arizona (1), California
(9), Colorado (2), Delaware (3), Georgia (2), Michigan (1), Nevada (2), New
York (1), Ohio (2), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (2), Texas
(7), Virginia (2), and West Virginia (1).

Illness onset dates range from June 21, 2011 to March 30, 2012. Infected
individuals range in age from less than 1 year to 83 years, with a median age
of 1 year. Fifty-four percent of patients are male. Among the 20 patients with
available information, 2 (10%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been
reported.

Among the 19 ill persons with information available, 13 (68%) reported
exposure to turtles before they became ill. Five ill persons reported the size
of the turtle they had contact with, and all 5 (100%) described turtles with a
shell length of less than 4 inches. Three ill persons who had contact with
small turtles reported where they purchased the turtles, and 3 (100%)
purchased the turtles from a street vendor.

In March 2012, samples from a turtle tank were collected from the home of an
ill person in New Mexico infected with _Salmonella_ Sandiego, strain A (the
Outbreak 1 strain). Samples yielded _Salmonella_ Pomona, strain B (the
Outbreak 5 strain). This suggests that the turtles causing Outbreak 1 and
Outbreak 5 may originate from a common source.

Illnesses that occurred after April 3, 2012, might not be reported yet due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported.

April 5, 2012

#### Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 50 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_
Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The 5 new ill persons have been
reported from California (4) and Minnesota (1) and have onset dates in August
2011. The _Salmonella_ Sandiego outbreak definition was expanded to include
cases whose illness began in August 2011, because new epidemiologic evidence
suggested that the outbreak began earlier than what was previously reported.
Twenty-eight (82%) of 34 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles
before becoming ill. Of the 19 ill persons who could recall the size of the
turtles with which they had contact, 18 (95%) identified turtles less than
four inches in size. Of the 6 ill persons who could recall the type of turtle
with which they had contact, 5 (83%) identified red-eared slider turtles.

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began
between August 3, 2011 and March 11, 2012. Infected individuals range in age
from less than one year old to 86 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 8
years of age or younger. Fifty-eight percent of patients are female. Among the
32 patients with available information, 8 (25%) have been hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

####  _Salmonella_ Sandiego Environmental Sampling Update

In March 2012, swabs taken from the turtle tank of a Virginia case yielded the
outbreak strain.



#### Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain A

#### Case Count Update

A total of 13 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_
Poona have been reported from 7 states. The 1 new ill person has been reported
from Texas. At this time, interview information is not available for this
person.

March 30, 2012

#### Initial Announcement

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states to
investigate three overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_
infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water
from a turtle habitat). The first is an outbreak of human _Salmonella_
Sandiego infections, the second is an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Pomona
infections, and the third is an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Poona
infections. These are rare types of _Salmonella_. The _Salmonella_ Sandiego
and _Salmonella_ Pomona outbreaks have similar geographic distributions, with
cases occurring in the Northeast and Southwest. The _Salmonella_ Poona
outbreak has a slightly different geographic distribution, with cases
occurring in the Midwest and Southwest. Public health investigators are using
the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of these
outbreaks. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and
food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of
_Salmonella_ bacteria are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-
field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be
part of this outbreak.

These outbreaks can be visually described with a chart showing the number of
persons who became ill each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi
curve. Illnesses that occurred after January 26, 2012 might not yet be
reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when
the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks. Please see the
_Salmonella_ Outbreak Investigations: Timeline for Reporting Cases for more
details.

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians
(such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human _Salmonella_ infections.
Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known
source of human _Salmonella_ infections, especially among young children.
Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the
sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can
carry _Salmonella_ germs and still appear healthy and clean. _Salmonella_
germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and
anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live
in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread
to people.

#### Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego, Strain A Outbreak Investigation

As of March 26, 2012, a total of 45 individuals infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella_ Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The number
of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (3), Georgia
(1), Massachusetts (2), Maryland (5), New Jersey (5), New Mexico (3), New York
(18), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (6), and Virginia (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began
between September 1, 2011 and March 16, 2012. Infected individuals range in
age from less than one year old to 86 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 9
years of age or younger. Fifty-eight percent of patients are female. Among the
25 patients with available information, 7 (28%) have been hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and
foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Nineteen (76%) of 25 ill
persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the
13 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had
contact, 12 (92%) identified turtles less than four inches in size. Of the 6
ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, 5
(83%) identified red-eared slider turtles.

In February 2012, one sample of turtle tank water from an ill person's home in
Pennsylvania yielded the outbreak strain.



#### Outbreak 2: _Salmonella_ Pomona, Strain A Outbreak Investigation

As of March 26, 2012, a total of 9 individuals infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella_ Pomona have been reported from 8 states. The number of
ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (2),
Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania
(1), Texas (1), and Vermont (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began
between December 9, 2011 and February 6, 2012. Infected individuals range in
age from less than one year old to 90 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 4
years of age or younger. Seventy-five percent of patients are female. Among
the 8 patients with available information, 2 (25%) have been hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

persons in the same California household yielded the outbreak strain.



#### Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Poona, Strain A Outbreak Investigation

As of March 26, 2012, a total of 12 individuals infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella_ Poona have been reported from 7 states. The number of
ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (2), California
(3), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Michigan (1), New York (2), and Texas (2).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began
between October 20, 2011 and February 18, 2012. Infected individuals range in
age from less than one year old to 70 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 4
years of age or younger. Sixty-seven percent of patients are female. Among the
7 patients with available information, 2 (29%) have been hospitalized. No
deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and
foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Nine (90%) of 10 ill
persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the
five ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had
contact, four (80%) described turtles less than four inches in size. Of the 7
ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, 7
(100%) identified red-eared slider turtles.
