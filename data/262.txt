#  Brachial Plexus Injuries

## Summary

The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that sends signals from the spine
to the shoulder, arm, and hand. Damage to the brachial plexus can cause
symptoms such as

  * A limp or paralyzed arm
  * Lack of muscle control in the arm, hand, or wrist
  * Lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand

Brachial plexus injuries can happen because of shoulder trauma, tumors, or
inflammation. Sometimes they happen during childbirth when a baby's shoulders
become stuck during delivery and the nerves stretch or tear.

Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many children who
are injured during birth improve or recover by 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment
includes physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery.
