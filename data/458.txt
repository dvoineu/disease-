## Summary

Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients. They are the most
important source of energy for your body. Your digestive system changes
carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body uses this sugar for energy
for your cells, tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in your liver
and muscles for when it is needed.

Carbohydrates are called simple or complex, depending on their chemical
structure. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such
as fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products. They also include sugars added
during food processing and refining. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain
breads and cereals, starchy vegetables and legumes. Many of the complex
carbohydrates are good sources of fiber.

For a healthy diet, limit the amount of added sugar that you eat and choose
whole grains over refined grains.
