## Summary

The average person has 5 million hairs. Hair grows all over your body except
on your lips, palms, and the soles of your feet. It takes about a month for
healthy hair to grow half an inch. Most hairs grow for up to six years and
then fall out. New hairs grow in their place.

Hair helps keep you warm. It also protects your eyes, ears and nose from small
particles in the air. Common problem with the hair and scalp include hair
loss, infections, and flaking.
