## Summary

Caregivers provide help to another person in need. The person receiving care
may be an adult - often a parent or a spouse - or a child with special medical
needs. Some caregivers are family members. Others are paid. They do many
things:

  * Shop for food and cook
  * Clean the house
  * Pay bills
  * Give medicine
  * Help the person go to the toilet, bathe and dress
  * Help the person eat
  * Provide company and emotional support

Caregiving is hard, and caregivers of chronically ill people often feel
stress. They are "on call" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you're caring for
someone with mental problems like Alzheimer's disease  it can be especially
difficult. Support groups can help.
