By the time young people graduate from high school, 40% have had sex. Fifty-
four percent of sexually active students did not use a condom the last time
they had sex, and 19% drank alcohol or took drugs before their last sexual
intercourse.1 Young people engage in sexual risk behaviors that can have
serious health consequences:

Helping adolescents make healthy choices requires the involvement of families,
communities, and many other sectors of society--and schools are an essential
part of that effort. There were nearly 56 million students in the United
States in 2017.5,6 Over 90% of students attend a public or private school for
at least 6 hours a day during the most critical years of their social,
physical, and intellectual development. The school environment is also a key
setting in which students' behaviors and ideas are shaped. Just as schools are
critical to preparing students academically and socially, they are also vital
partners in helping young people take responsibility for their health and
adopt health-enhancing attitudes and behaviors that can last a lifetime.
