# Protein electrophoresis - serum

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

This lab test measures the types of protein in the fluid (serum) part of a
blood sample. This fluid is called serum.

## How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.

In the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and
applies an electric current. The proteins move on the paper and form bands
that show the amount of each protein.

## How to Prepare for the Test

You may be asked not to eat or drink for 12 hours before this test.

Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care
provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. DO NOT stop
any medicine before talking to your provider.

## How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.
Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing
or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

## Why the Test is Performed

Proteins are made from amino acids and are important parts of all cells and
tissues. There are many different kinds of proteins in the body, and they have
many different functions. Examples of proteins include enzymes, certain
hormones, hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad cholesterol), and
others.

Serum proteins are classified as albumin or globulins. Albumin is the most
abundant protein in the serum. It carries many small molecules. It is also
important for keeping fluid from leaking out from the blood vessels into the
tissues.

Globulins are divided into alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma globulins. In
general, alpha and gamma globulin protein levels increase when there is
inflammation in the body.

Lipoprotein electrophoresis determines the amount of proteins made up of
protein and fat, called lipoproteins (such as LDL cholesterol).

## Normal Results

Normal value ranges are:

    * Total protein: 6.4 to 8.3 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 64 to 83 grams per liter (g/L)
    * Albumin: 3.5 to 5.0 g/dL or 35 to 50 g/L
    * Alpha-1 globulin: 0.1 to 0.3 g/dL or 1 to 3 g/L
    * Alpha-2 globulin: 0.6 to 1.0 g/dL or 6 to 10 g/L
    * Beta globulin: 0.7 to 1.2 g/dL or 7 to 12 g/L
    * Gamma globulin: 0.7 to 1.6 g/dL or 7 to 16 g/L

The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal
value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use
different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about
the meaning of your specific results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Decreased total protein may indicate:

    * Abnormal loss of protein from the digestive tract or the inability of the digestive tract to absorb proteins (protein-losing enteropathy)
    * Malnutrition
    * Kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome
    * Scarring of the liver and poor liver function (cirrhosis) 

Increased alpha-1 globulin proteins may be due to:

    * Acute inflammatory disease
    * Cancer
    * Chronic inflammatory disease (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) 

Decreased alpha-1 globulin proteins may be a sign of:

    * Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

Increased alpha-2 globulin proteins may indicate a:

    * Acute inflammation
    * Chronic inflammation 

Decreased alpha-2 globulin proteins may indicate:

    * Breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis) 

Increased beta globulin proteins may indicate:

    * A disorder in which the body has problems breaking down fats (for example, hyperlipoproteinemia, familial hypercholesterolemia)
    * Estrogen therapy 

Decreased beta globulin proteins may indicate:

    * Abnormally low level of LDL cholesterol
    * Malnutrition 

Increased gamma globulin proteins may indicate:

    * Blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia, lymphomas, and chronic lymphocytic leukemiasÂ 
    * Chronic inflammatory disease (for example, rheumatoid arthritis)
    * Acute infection
    * Chronic liver disease

## Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries
vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the
other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:

    * Excessive bleeding
    * Fainting or feeling lightheaded
    * Multiple punctures to locate veins  

    * Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
    * Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
