## Summary

When someone's blood flow or breathing stops, seconds count. Permanent brain
damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for
a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing. CPR can maintain
circulation and breathing until emergency medical help arrives.

Even if you haven't had training, you can do "hands-only" CPR for a teen or
adult whose heart has stopped beating ("hands-only" CPR isn't recommended for
children). "Hands-only" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating
until emergency help arrives. If you've had training, you can use chest
compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing
helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing. To keep
your skills up, you should repeat the training every two years.
