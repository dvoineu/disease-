Outbreak Summary

#### Introduction

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S.
Food and Drug AdministrationExternal (FDA) investigated a multistate outbreak
of _Salmonella_ Braenderup infections.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses
that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of
public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA
fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people
by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole
genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA
fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA
fingerprint than PFGE.

As of June 13, 2018, 45 people infected with the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Braenderup were reported from 10 states. A list of the states and
the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from November 16, 2017 to May 13, 2018. Ill
people ranged in age from 1 to 90, with a median age of 60. Fifty-six percent
were female. Eleven people were hospitalized, and no deaths were reported.

Testing of 3 clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility
testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
(NARMS) laboratory did not show any resistance. Whole genome sequencing of 27
clinical and 7 environmental isolates also did not predict resistance to
antibiotics on the NARMS panel.

#### Investigation of the Outbreak

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicated that shell eggs
produced by Rose Acre Farms' Hyde County, North Carolina farm were the likely
source of this multistate outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and
other exposures in the week before they became ill. Thirty (83%) of 36 people
interviewed reported eating shell eggs. Nineteen (53%) reported eating various
egg dishes at different restaurants. This latter percentage is significantly
higher than results from a survey Cdc-pdf[PDF - 787 KB] of healthy people in
which 38% of respondents reported eating any eggs away from home in the week
before they were interviewed. These restaurants reported using shell eggs in
the dishes eaten by ill people.

FDA traced the source of some of the shell eggs supplied to these restaurant
locations to Rose Acre Farms' Hyde County, North Carolina farm. FDA
investigators inspected the farm and collected samples for testing. Laboratory
testing identified the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Braenderup in
environmental samples taken at the farm.

On April 13, 2018, Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Indiana, voluntarily
recalledExternal 206,749,248 shell eggs because they could have been
contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria. Recalled eggs were sold in grocery
stores and to restaurants in Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia under
multiple brand names, including Coburn Farms, Country Daybreak, Crystal Farms,
Food Lion, Glenview, Great Value, Nelms, and Sunshine Farms. On April 16,
2018, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. voluntarily recalled 23,400 dozen eggs purchased
from Rose Acre Farms.

As of June 14, 2018, this outbreak appears to be over.

### Previous Outbreak Announcements

May 10, 2018

#### Case Count Update

Since the last update on April 16, 2018, 12 more ill people were added to this
outbreak.

As of May 10, 2018, 35 people infected with the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Braenderup have been reported from 9 states. A list of the states
and the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page.
Illnesses started on dates ranging from November 16, 2017 to April 14, 2018.
Ill people range in age from 1 to 90 years, with a median age of 65. Fifty
percent of ill people are female. Of 28 people with information available, 11
(39%) have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after March 23, 2018, might not yet be reported due to
the time it takes between when a person becomes ill with _Salmonella_ and when
the illness is reported. This takes an average of two to four weeks.

WGS analysis did not identify antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from
22 ill people. Testing of three clinical isolates using standard antibiotic
susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also did not show any resistance.

#### Investigation Update

State and local health officials continue to interview ill people to ask about
the foods they ate and other exposures they had before they became ill.
Twenty-two (88%) of 25 people interviewed reported eating shell eggs. Sixteen
(64%) reported eating various egg dishes at different restaurants. This
percentage is significantly higher than results from a surveyCdc-pdf[787 KB of
healthy people in which 38% of respondents reported eating any eggs away from
home in the week before they were interviewed. These restaurants reported
using shell eggs in the dishes eaten by ill people.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide more information as it
becomes available.

Initial Announcement

#### April 16, 2018

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S.
Food and Drug AdministrationExternal (FDA) are investigating a multistate
outbreak of _Salmonella_ Braenderup infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify
illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national
subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories
coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria
isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages
a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.
WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of April 16, 2018, 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Braenderup have been reported from 9 states. A list of the states
and the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page. WGS
performed on bacteria isolated from ill people showed that they were closely
relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely
to share a common source of infection.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from November 16, 2017, to March 22, 2018.
Ill people range in age from 5 to 90, with a median age of 65. Fifty-five
percent are male. Six people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been
reported.

This outbreak can be illustrated with a chart showing the number of people who
became ill each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve, or epi curve.
Illnesses that occurred after February 25, 2018, might not yet be reported due
to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is
reported. This takes an average of two to four weeks. Please see the Timeline
for Reporting Cases of _Salmonella_ Infection for more details.

WGS analysis did not predict antibiotic resistance in isolates from 14 ill
people. Standard antibiotic resistance testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

#### Investigation of the Outbreak

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that shell eggs
produced by Rose Acre Farms are the likely source of this multistate outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and
other exposures in the week before they became ill. Seventeen (100%) of 17
people interviewed reported eating shell eggs. Eleven (65%) reported eating
various egg dishes at different restaurants. This percentage is significantly
higher than results from a survey Cdc-pdf[787 KB] of healthy people in which
38% of respondents reported eating any eggs away from home in the week before
they were interviewed. These restaurants reported using shell eggs in the
dishes eaten by ill people.

FDA traced the source of some of the shell eggs supplied to these restaurant
locations to Rose Acre Farms' Hyde County, North Carolina farm. FDA
investigators inspected the farm and collected samples for testing. Laboratory
testing identified the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Braenderup in
environmental samples taken at the farm.

On April 13, 2018, Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Indiana, voluntarily
recalledExternal 206,749,248 shell eggs because they could be contaminated
with _Salmonella_ bacteria. Recalled eggs were sold in grocery stores and to
restaurants in Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia under multiple brand
names, including Coburn Farms, Country Daybreak, Crystal Farms, Food Lion,
Glenview, Great Value, Nelms, and Sunshine Farms.

This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates when they are
available.
