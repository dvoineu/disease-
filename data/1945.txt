#  Rare Diseases

## Summary

A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United
States. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases. More than 25 million Americans
have one.

Rare diseases

    * May involve chronic illness, disability, and often premature death
    * Often have no treatment or not very effective treatment
    * Are frequently not diagnosed correctly
    * Are often very complex
    * Are often caused by changes in genes

It can be hard to find a specialist who knows how to treat your rare disease.
Disease advocacy groups, rare disease organizations, and genetics clinics may
help you to find one.
