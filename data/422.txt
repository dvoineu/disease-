## Summary

Your spine, or backbone, protects your spinal cord and allows you to stand and
bend. Spinal stenosis causes narrowing in your spine. The narrowing puts
pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.

Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a
spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as
arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear
gradually or not at all. They include

    * Pain in your neck or back
    * Numbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in your arms or legs
    * Pain going down the leg
    * Foot problems

Doctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests.
Treatments include medications, physical therapy, braces, and surgery.
