## Summary

Your pleura is a large, thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of
your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Between the layers of
the pleura is a very thin space. Normally it's filled with a small amount of
fluid. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each
other as your lungs breathe air in and out.

Disorders of the pleura include

    * Pleurisy - inflammation of the pleura that causes sharp pain with breathing
    * Pleural effusion - excess fluid in the pleural space
    * Pneumothorax - buildup of air or gas in the pleural space
    * Hemothorax - buildup of blood in the pleural space

Many different conditions can cause pleural problems. Viral infection is the
most common cause of pleurisy. The most common cause of pleural effusion is
congestive heart failure. Lung diseases, like COPD, tuberculosis, and acute
lung injury, cause pneumothorax. Injury to the chest is the most common cause
of hemothorax. Treatment focuses on removing fluid, air, or blood from the
pleural space, relieving symptoms, and treating the underlying condition.
