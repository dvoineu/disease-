# Facts About Hypertension

Blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the walls of your
arteries. Arteries carry blood from your heart to other parts of your body.

Blood pressure normally rises and falls throughout the day, but it can damage
your heart and cause health problems if it stays high for a long time.
Hypertension, also called high blood pressure, is blood pressure that is
higher than normal.

## Facts About Hypertension in the United States

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association
published new guidelines for hypertension management and defined high
hypertension as a blood pressure at or above 130/80 mm Hg. Stage 2
hypertension is defined as a blood pressure at or above 140/90 mm Hg. 1

Blood Pressure Categories Blood Pressure Category | Systolic Blood Pressure |
| Diastolic Blood Pressure  
---|---|---|---  
  Normal | <120 mm Hg | and | <80 mm Hg  
  Elevated | 120-129 mm Hg | and | <80 mm Hg  
Hypertension  
  Stage 1 | 130-139 mm Hg | or | 80-89 mm Hg  
  Stage 2 | ≥140 mm Hg | or | ≥90 mm Hg

Uncontrolled high blood pressure is common; however, certain groups of people

## Rates of High Blood Pressure Vary by Geography

High blood pressure is more common in some areas of the United States than in
others. Below is a map showing the self-reported rate of hypertension by state
in 2011 (using a definition of hypertension as a blood pressure ≥140/≥90 mm
Hg). However, this map likely underreports the true effect of hypertension in
each state, because about 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure is unaware of
it and would not report having it.5

![This map shows the highest rates of hypertension prevalence are located in
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana. The high rates range in value
from 32 to 38.6 percent of adults 20 years and older reporting they have been
told by a doctor that they have high blood
pressure.](/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/images/fs_bloodpressure.jpg)
