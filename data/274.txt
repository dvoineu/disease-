## Summary

There are many new responsibilities when you have a baby. One of them is to
make sure they get the checkups that they need. Well-baby exams are important
in making sure that your baby is growing and developing properly. If there are
problems, you can catch them early. This means that there is a better chance
for treatment.

During these checkups, your baby will get any needed immunizations and
screenings. This is also a good chance to ask your health care provider any
questions about how to care for your baby.
