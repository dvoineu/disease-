Delayed ejaculation is a medical condition in which a male cannot ejaculate.
It may occur either during intercourse or by manual stimulation with or
without a partner. Ejaculation is when semen is released from the penis.

## Causes

Most men ejaculate within a few minutes of starting to thrust during
intercourse. Men with delayed ejaculation may be unable to ejaculate or may
only be able to ejaculate with great effort after having intercourse for a
long time (for example, 30 to 45 minutes).

Delayed ejaculation can have psychological or physical causes.

Common psychological causes include:

    * Religious background that makes the person view sex as sinful
    * Lack of attraction for a partner
    * Conditioning caused by a habit of excessive masturbation
    * Traumatic events (such as being discovered masturbating or having illicit sex, or learning one's partner is having an affair) 

Some factors, such as anger toward the partner, may be involved.

Physical causes may include:

    * Blockage of the ducts that semen passes through
    * Use of certain drugs
    * Nervous system diseases, such as stroke or nerve damage to the spinal cord or back
    * Nerve damage during surgery in the pelvis 

## Exams and Tests

Stimulating the penis with a vibrator or other device may determine whether
you have a physical problem. This is often a nervous system problem. A nervous
system (neurological) exam may reveal other nerve problems that are connected
with delayed ejaculation.

## Treatment

If you have never ejaculated through any form of stimulation, see a urologist
to determine if the problem has a physical cause. (Examples of stimulation may
include wet dreams, masturbation, or intercourse.)

See a therapist who specializes in ejaculation problems if you are unable to
ejaculate in an acceptable amount of time. Sex therapy most often includes
both partners. In most cases, the therapist will teach you about the sexual
response. You also will learn how to communicate and guide your partner to
provide the right stimulation.

Therapy often involves a series of "homework" assignments. In the privacy of
your home, you and your partner engage in sexual activities that reduce
performance pressure and focus on pleasure.

Typically, you will not have sexual intercourse for a certain period of time.
In this time, you will gradually learn to enjoy ejaculation through other
types of stimulation.

In cases where there is a problem with the relationship or a lack of sexual
desire, you may need therapy to improve your relationship and emotional
intimacy.

Sometimes, hypnosis may be a helpful addition to therapy. This may be useful
if one partner is not willing to participate in therapy. Trying to self-treat
this problem is often not successful.

If a medicine may be the cause of the problem, discuss other drug options with
your health care provider. Never stop taking any medicine without first
talking to your provider.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Treatment commonly requires about 12 to 18 sessions. The average success rate
is 70% to 80%.

You will have a better outcome if:

    * You have a past history of satisfying sexual experiences.
    * The problem has not been occurring for a long time.
    * You have feelings of sexual desire.
    * You feel love or attraction toward your sexual partner.
    * You are motivated to get treated.
    * You do not have serious psychological problems. 

If medicines are causing the problem, your provider may recommend switching or
stopping the medicine, if possible. A full recovery is possible if this can be
done.

## Possible Complications

If the problem is not treated, the following may occur:

    * Avoidance of sexual contact
    * Inhibited sexual desire 
    * Stress within the relationship
    * Sexual dissatisfaction
    * Difficulty with conception and getting pregnant

If you and your partner are trying to get pregnant, sperm can be collected
using other methods.

## Prevention

Having a healthy attitude about your sexuality and genitals helps prevent
delayed ejaculation. Realize that you cannot force yourself to have a sexual
response, just as you cannot force yourself to go to sleep or to perspire. The
harder you try to have a certain sexual response, the harder it becomes to
respond.

To reduce the pressure, focus on the pleasure of the moment. Do not worry
about whether or when you will ejaculate. Your partner should create a relaxed
atmosphere, and should not pressure you about whether or not you have
ejaculated. Openly discuss any fears or anxieties, such as fear of pregnancy
or disease, with your partner.
