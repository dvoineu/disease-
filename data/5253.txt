Leg pain is a common problem. It can be due to a cramp, injury, or other
cause.

## Causes

Leg pain can be due to a muscle cramp (also called a charley horse). Common
causes of cramps include:

    * Dehydration or low amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium in the blood
    * Medicines (such as diuretics and statins)
    * Muscle fatigue or strain from overuse, too much exercise, or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time 

An injury can also cause leg pain from:

    * A torn or overstretched muscle (strain)
    * Hairline crack in the bone (stress fracture)
    * Inflamed tendon (tendinitis)
    * Shin splints (pain in the front of the leg from overuse) 

Other common causes of leg pain include:

    * Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which causes a problem with blood flow in the legs (this type of pain, called claudication, is generally felt when exercising or walking and is relieved by rest)
    * Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) from long-term bed rest
    * Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or skin and soft tissue (cellulitis)
    * Inflammation of the leg joints caused by arthritis or gout
    * Nerve damage common to people with diabetes, smokers, and alcoholics
    * Varicose veins

Less common causes include:

    * Cancerous bone tumors (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma)
    * Legg-Calve-Perthes disease: Poor blood flow to the hip that may stop or slow the normal growth of the leg
    * Noncancerous (benign) tumors or cysts of the femur or tibia (osteoid osteoma)
    * Sciatic nerve pain (radiating pain down the leg) caused by a slipped disk in the back
    * Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: Most often seen in boys and overweight children between ages 11 and 15 

## Home Care

If you have leg pain from cramps or overuse, take these steps first:

    * Rest as much as possible.
    * Elevate your leg.
    * Apply ice for up to 15 minutes. Do this 4 times per day, more often for the first few days.
    * Gently stretch and massage cramping muscles.
    * Take over-the-counter pain medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. 

Other homecare will depend on the cause of your leg pain.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if:

    * The painful leg is swollen or red.
    * You have a fever.
    * Your pain gets worse when you walk or exercise and improves with rest.
    * The leg is black and blue.
    * The leg is cold and pale.
    * You are taking medicines that may be causing leg pain. DO NOT stop taking or change any of your medicines without talking to your provider.
    * Self-care steps do not help. 

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will perform a physical exam and look at your legs, feet,
thighs, hips, back, knees, and ankles.

Your provider may ask questions such as:

    * Where on the leg is the pain? Is the pain in one or both legs? 
    * Is the pain dull and aching or sharp and stabbing? Is the pain severe? Is the pain worse at any time of day?
    * What makes the pain feel worse? Does anything make your pain feel better?
    * Do you have any other symptoms such as numbness, tingling, back pain, or fever?

Your provider may recommend physical therapy for some causes of leg pain.
