## Summary

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage
other parts of the body.

TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat
coughs, sneezes, or talks. If you have been exposed, you should go to your
doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune
system.

Symptoms of TB in the lungs may include

    * A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer
    * Weight loss
    * Loss of appetite
    * Coughing up blood or mucus
    * Weakness or fatigue 
    * Fever
    * Night sweats

Skin tests, blood tests, x-rays, and other tests can tell if you have TB. If
not treated properly, TB can be deadly. You can usually cure active TB by
taking several medicines for a long period of time.
