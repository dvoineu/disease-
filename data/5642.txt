Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children -- United States, February 12-April 2,
2020  
CDC MMWR, April 6, 2020 ![Brand](/PHGKB/images/CDC_Info.jpg)

Among 345 pediatric cases, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition. The
most common underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (including asthma)
(40), cardiovascular disease (25), and immunosuppression (10). 77% of
hospitalized patients, including all six patients admitted to an ICU, had one
or more underlying medical condition.

Assessment of Specimen Pooling to Conserve SARS CoV-2 Testing Resources  
B Abdalhamid et al, MEDRXIV, April 6, 2020

Parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were: prevalence
rate of 5%, a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies per microliter,
sensitivity and specificity of 100%, two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range
of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples.

Quantifying the use of connected digital products in clinical research  
C Marra et al, NPJ Digital Medicine, April 2020

Using 18 years of data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we document substantial growth
in the use of connected digital products in clinical trials (~34% CAGR) and
show that these products have been used across all phases of research and by a
diverse group of trial sponsors.

![Genetic Risk Score](/GAPPKBImage/images/2017-12_risk.jpg) **Genetic Risk
Score **

Electronic health records and polygenic risk scores for predicting disease
risk  
R Li et al, Nat Rev Genetics, March 31, 2020

Increasingly, electronic health records (EHRs) are being linked to patient
genetic data in biobanks, which provides new opportunities for developing and
applying polygenic risk scores in the clinic, to systematically examine and
evaluate patient susceptibilities to disease. However, the heterogeneous
nature of EHR data brings forth many practical challenges.
