### Is It Harmful To Breathe The Secondhand Emissions From Heated Tobacco
Products?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Heated tobacco products produce emissions that are not as safe as clean air.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Studies of secondhand emissions from heated tobacco products suggest that the products expose both users and bystanders to some of the same chemicals found in cigarette smoke, although at lower levels than cigarette smoke.2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Additional research is needed to understand the health effects of heated tobacco products and their emissions.

### Are Heated Tobacco Products Less Harmful Than Regular Cigarettes?

The **aerosol created from heated tobacco products** generally contains lower
levels of harmful ingredients than the smoke from regular cigarettes. However,
that does not mean heated tobacco products are safe.

Research suggests that heated tobacco products **contain many of the same
harmful ingredients as regular cigarettes** , as well as other harmful
ingredients not present in regular cigarettes.

**Additional research is needed** to determine whether adult cigarette smokers
who completely switch to heated tobacco products might reduce their risks of
tobacco-related disease.

As of January 8, 2020, **no tobacco company has received permission from the
FDA to market a heated tobacco product as a reduced-risk product**.

#### Heated tobacco products are **not an FDA-approved method** for quitting
smoking.

### Who Is Using Heated Tobacco Products?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as of January 8, 2020, has authorized IQOS and Eclipse heated tobacco products for sale in this country. Sales of other heated tobacco products are growing worldwide.

At that time, 0.7% of adults, including 2.7% of people who currently smoked regular cigarettes, reported they had ever used a heated tobacco product.3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Reported use of heated tobacco products went up in 2018, when 2.4% of adults, including 6.7% of people who currently smoked regular cigarettes, reported they had ever used a heated tobacco product.4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * There are no studies yet looking at how many youth and young adults in the United States use heated tobacco products.
