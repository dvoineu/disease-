## Summary

Vulvar cancer is a rare type of cancer. It forms in a woman's external
genitals, called the vulva. The cancer usually grows slowly over several
years. First, precancerous cells grow on vulvar skin. This is called vulvar
intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or dysplasia. Not all VIN cases turn into
cancer, but it is best to treat it early.

Often, vulvar cancer doesn't cause symptoms at first. However, see your doctor
for testing if you notice

    * A lump in the vulva
    * Vulvar itching or tenderness
    * Bleeding that is not your period
    * Changes in the vulvar skin, such as color changes or growths that look like a wart or ulcer

You are at greater risk if you've had a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
or have a history of genital warts. Your health care provider diagnoses vulvar
cancer with a physical exam and a biopsy. Treatment varies, depending on your
overall health and how advanced the cancer is. It might include surgery,
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts
your body's own ability to fight cancer.
