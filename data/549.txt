## Summary

Infectious mononucleosis, or "mono", is an infection usually caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus. The virus spreads through saliva, which is why it's
sometimes called "kissing disease." Mono occurs most often in teens and young
adults. However, you can get it at any age. Symptoms of mono include

    * Fever
    * Sore throat
    * Swollen lymph glands

Sometimes you may also have a swollen spleen. Serious problems are rare.

A blood test can show if you have mono. Most people get better in two to four
weeks. However, you may feel tired for a few months afterward. Treatment
focuses on helping symptoms and includes medicines for pain and fever, warm
salt water gargles and plenty of rest and fluids.
