## Summary

If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.
Over time, this can cause problems with other body functions, such as your
kidneys, nerves, feet, and eyes. Having diabetes can also put you at a higher
risk for heart disease and bone and joint disorders. Other long-term
complications of diabetes include skin problems, digestive problems, sexual
dysfunction, and problems with your teeth and gums.

Very high or very low blood sugar levels can also lead to emergencies in
people with diabetes. The cause can be an underlying infection, certain
medicines, or even the medicines you take to control your diabetes. If you
feel nauseated, sluggish or shaky, seek emergency care.
