# Example: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Air-to-Ground (Air-Ground)
Patient Handoff

Minus

Purpose

This document provides guidance to facilitate planning for and execution of
patient handoff between an air ambulance agency and a ground ambulance agency.
This may occur when an air ambulance agency transfers the patient to a ground
ambulance agency or when a ground ambulance agency transfers a patient to an
air ambulance agency. This SOP is focused on fixed-wing transport and not
rotor-wing. It does not address broader air and ground ambulance SOPs.
Information is presented at a level of detail that will afford local planners
and operators the flexibility to develop procedures that are suitable for
their environment.

The following key assumptions are being made:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * All involved healthcare workers (air and ground) have received education and training and demonstrated the necessary competencies for management of patients with serious communicable diseases.
