Caring for children during emergency procedures calls for planning and action
before an emergency happens.

### Progress on Including Children's Needs During Emergencies

Although children have a greater chance of being harmed during an emergency,
it takes special attention to children's needs to make sure they are not
passed over when emergency plans are made or carried out. Caring for children
during emergency procedures, such as evacuation, decontamination, and
sheltering, calls for planning and action before an emergency happens. For
example, in an emergency, hospitals might have to care for a large number of
children. Without planning ahead of time, hospitals may not have the right
equipment and supplies to care for more than the usual number of young
patients.

Agencies in local communities and at the state and national levels are working
to make sure children are protected during disasters by taking steps, such as

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created a Children's
Preparedness Unit (CPU) in 2012 to focus on protecting children during
outbreaks and other emergencies. CPU works with partners to include children's
needs in all stages of an emergency. Most recently, CPU members staffed the
CDC Emergency Operations Center for the Zika virus outbreak to serve as
experts on children's health. For the 2017 hurricane responses, CPU worked
closely with CDC's Vulnerable Populations Officer to establish the first At
Risk Task Force for a response. This unique collaboration helped strengthen
connections between groups across the agency and increase efficiency for
current and future response efforts.

### Moving Forward

Progress has been made, but there is still more work to do to protect children
during emergencies. More research could determine how well emergency plans
have protected children so far, how plans can be improved, and what can be
done to serve children better during emergency events. For example, research
could provide information on the mental health of children in disasters.
Children respond to upsetting events differently, depending on their ages and
states of development. Taking these differences into account in emergency
plans might be one way to do a better job of caring for children.

Preparing to take care of children during a disaster is not always easy but
planning now can protect their safety and health in the future. **For more
