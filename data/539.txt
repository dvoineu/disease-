## Summary

Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with
the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause
complications and sometimes even death. Getting the flu vaccine every year is
the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to
others.

The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks
after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with
the viruses that are in the vaccine.

There are different types of flu shots, including some especially for people
65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.

Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season.
People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a
vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have

    * Had reactions to flu shots before
    * Guillain-Barre Syndrome
    * A fever
