## Summary

Planning for the end of life can be difficult. But by deciding what end-of-
life care best suits your needs when you are healthy, you can help those close
to you make the right choices when the time comes.

End-of-life planning usually includes making choices about the following:

  * The goals of care (for example, whether to use certain medicines during the last days of life)
  * Where you want to spend your final days
  * Which treatments for end-of-life care you wish to receive
  * What type of palliative care and hospice care you wish to receive

Advance directives can help make your wishes clear to your family and health
care providers.
