Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will have only mild illness and should
recover at home.* Care at home can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and help
protect people who are at risk for getting seriously ill from COVID-19.

If you are caring for someone at home, monitor for emergency signs, prevent
the spread of germs, treat symptoms, and carefully consider when to end home
isolation.

***Note:** Older adults and people of any age with certain serious underlying
medical conditions like lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes are at higher
risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness and
should seek care as soon as symptoms start.

COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet)
through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes,
or talks. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have
symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.

## Monitor the person for worsening symptoms. Know the emergency warning
signs.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Have their healthcare provider's contact information on hand.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * If they are getting sicker, call their healthcare provider. For medical emergencies, call 911 and notify the dispatch personnel that they have or are suspected to have COVID-19.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If the sick person needs to be around others (within the home, in a vehicle, or doctor's office), they should wear a cloth face covering that covers their mouth and nose.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after interacting with the sick person. If soap and water are not readily available, **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol**. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
