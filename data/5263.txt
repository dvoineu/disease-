The _Arenaviridae_ are a family of viruses whose members are generally
associated with rodent-transmitted diseases in humans. Each virus usually is
associated with a particular rodent host species in which it is maintained.
Arenavirus infections are relatively common in humans in some areas of the
world and can cause severe illnesses.

The virus particles are spherical and have an average diameter of 110-130
nanometers. All are enveloped in a lipid (fat) membrane. Viewed in cross-
section, they show grainy particles that are ribosomes acquired from their
host cells. It is this characteristic that gave them their name, derived from
the Latin "arena", which means "sandy". Their genome, or genetic material, is
composed of RNA only, and while their replication strategy is not completely
understood, we know that new viral particles, called virions, are created by
budding from the surface of their hosts' cells.

## Arenavirus history

The first Arenavirus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), was isolated
in 1933 during a study of an epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis. Although not
the cause of the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of aseptic
(nonbacterial) meningitis. By the 1960s, several similar viruses had been
discovered and they were classified into the new family _Arenaviridae_. Since
Tacaribe virus was found in 1956, new Arenavirus have been discovered on the
average of every one to three years. A number of Arenavirus have been isolated
in rodents only, but few cause hemorrhagic disease. Junin virus, isolated in
1958, was the first of these to be recognized. This virus causes Argentine
hemorrhagic fever in a limited agrigultural area of the pampas in Argentina.
Several years later, in 1963, in the remote savannas of the Beni province of
Bolivia, Machupo virus was isolated. The next member of the virus family to be
associated with an outbreak of human illness was Lassa virus in Nigeria in
1969. The most recent additions to these human pathogenic viruses were
Guanarito detected in Venezuela in 1989, Sabia in Brazil in 1993, Chapare in
Bolivia in 2004, and Lujo in South Africa in 2008.

## Arenaviruses groups

Arenavirus are divided into two groups: the New World or Tacaribe complex and
the Old World or LCM/Lassa complex. Viruses in these groups that cause mild or
severe illness in humans and are listed below by date of discovery:

Arenaviruses that cause human diseases Virus | Disease | Year discovered  
---|---|---  
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) | Lymphocytic choriomeningitis |
1933  
Junin virus | Argentine hemorrhagic fever | 1958  
Machupo virus | Bolivian hemorrhagic fever | 1963  
Lassa virus | Lassa fever | 1969  
Guanarito virus | Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever | 1989  
Sabia | Brazilian hemorrhagic fever | 1993  
Chapare | Chapare hemorrhagic fever | 2004  
Lujo | Lujo hemorrhagic fever | 2008  
  
## Animal hosts

These viruses are zoonotic, meaning that, in nature, they are found in
animals. Each virus is associated with either one species or a few closely
related rodents, which constitute the virus' natural reservoir. Tacaribe
complex viruses are generally associated with the New World rats and mice
(family _Muridae_ , subfamily _Sigmodontinae_ ). The LCM/Lassa complex viruses
are associated with the Old World rats and mice (family _Muridae_ , subfamily
_Murinae_ ). Taken together, these types of rodents are located across the
greater proportion of the earth's land mass, including Europe, Asia, Africa,
and the Americas. One notable exception is Tacaribe virus, found in Trinidad,
which was isolated from bats and mosquitoes.

## Spreading Arenavirus infections

The rodent hosts of Arenavirus species are chronically infected with virus;
however, the viruses do not appear to cause obvious illness in them. Some
Arenavirus types appear to be passed from mother rodents to their offspring
during pregnancy, and thus remain in the rodent population generation after
generation. Most infections are transmitted among adult rodents, likely via
fighting and inflicting bites. Only a portion of the rodents in each host
species is infected at any one time, and in many cases only in a limited
portion of the host's geographical range. Viruses are shed into the
environment in the urine or droppings of the infected hosts.

Human infection with an Arenavirus is incidental to the natural cycle of the
viruses and occurs when an individual comes into contact with the excretions
or materials contaminated with the excretions of an infected rodent, such as
ingestion of contaminated food, or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin
with rodent excrement. Infection can also occur by inhalation of tiny
particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). The types
of incidental contact depend on the habits of both humans and rodents. For
example, where the infected rodent species prefers a field habitat, human
infection is associated with agricultural work. In areas where the rodent
species' habitat includes human homes or other buildings, infection occurs in
domestic settings.

Some Arenaviruses, such as Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses, are associated
with secondary person-to-person and nosocomial (healthcare setting)
transmission. This occurs when a person infected by exposure to the virus from
the rodent host spreads the virus to other humans. This may occur in a variety
of ways. Person-to-person transmission is associated with direct contact with
the blood or other body fluids, containing virus particles, of infected
individuals. Airborne transmission has also been reported in connection with
certain viruses. Contact with objects contaminated with these materials, such
as medical equipment, is also associated with transmission. In these
situations, use of protective clothing and disinfection procedures (together
called barrier nursing) help prevent further spread of illness.
