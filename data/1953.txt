## Summary

Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking
and perceptions. People with psychoses lose touch with reality. Two of the
main symptoms are delusions and hallucinations. Delusions are false beliefs,
such as thinking that someone is plotting against you or that the TV is
sending you secret messages. Hallucinations are false perceptions, such as
hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there.

Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder
may also have psychotic symptoms. Other problems that can cause psychosis
include alcohol and some drugs, brain tumors, brain infections, and stroke.

Treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis. It might involve drugs to
control symptoms and talk therapy. Hospitalization is an option for serious
cases where a person might be dangerous to himself or others.
