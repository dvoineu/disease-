### Environmental Health

![map icon for Maryland](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/MD.jpg)

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community around you, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
affected negatively.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting public
health workers, educating communities, and providing scientific knowledge. We
help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a healthy
environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness caused by
environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might be
exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing healthcare costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

Asthma

In 2009 an estimated 389,000 Maryland adults and159,000 children were living
with asthma--that's about 9 percent of adults and 12 percent of children.

Asthma is a common disease on the rise, with significant health disparities
and associated healthcare costs. Nearly 1 in 12 Americans (26 million) have
asthma. In the last decade, the proportion of people with asthma, grew by
nearly 15%.

CDC has been working with states for more than 10 years to implement
community-based interventions, build local coalitions, and track the impact of
the disease on the U.S. population.

The program focuses on what works to control asthma: assessing and measuring
changes in disease severity and control, using the right medications,
educating people to manage their conditions, and controlling environmental
irritants and allergens.

Even though the number of people with asthma has increased over the last 10
years, trends show that more are controlling their disease:

**Lead Poisoning Prevention Program**

(FY 2011 funding for Maryland--$594,000; because of funding reductions, the
program was discontinued in 2012. Some funding was restored in FY 2014. States
will be recompeting for funding and more information will be available later
in the year.)

More than 12 million U.S. children are exposed to lead in their homes at
levels that can harm their intellectual development. No safe blood lead level
in children has been identified.

Reducing children's lead exposure is perhaps the greatest environmental health
accomplishment in the past 20 years.

For more than 20 years, CDC has funded state and local health agencies to

Children exposed to lead lose $3,000 to almost $8,000 in lifetime productivity
for each 1 microgram per deciliter (μg/dL) increase in blood lead level. Blood
lead levels over 1 μg/dL are associated with measurable reductions in IQ.

Between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, interventions that control or eliminate lead
hazards before children are exposed (primary prevention) helped reduce the
number of children exposed to lead (blood lead levels ≥ 1μg/dL) by nearly 3
million, saving $26-57 billion in lifetime productivity earnings alone. These
estimates do not account for behavioral and other adverse effects on lifetime
productivity linked to lead.

**Environmental Public Health Tracking Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Maryland--$614,000. A new funding announcement has been
released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the year.)

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 25% of all diseases
are caused by environmental exposures. Some of these diseases--such as cancer,
asthma, and cardiovascular disease--are the greatest killers today.

CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) is a
dynamic web-based tool that tracks and reports environmental hazards and the
health problems that may be related to them.

The Tracking Network's integrated health, environmental exposure, and hazard
information is used to

Changes occurring in the world's climate are affecting our health and well-
being, especially among the most vulnerable among us--children, the elderly,
the poor, and people with underlying health conditions.

Climate and Health Program funding for CDC represents the dedicated U.S.
government investment in preparing our nation to anticipate and adapt to the
health consequences of climate events like extreme weather events, wildfires,

**Built Environment and Health Initiative 1**

(FY 2013 funding for Maryland--$155,000. A new funding announcement has been
released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the year.)

The way we design and build our communities can affect our physical and mental
health. Public health challenges like asthma, motor vehicle-related injuries,
obesity, and heart disease are directly related to how communities are
designed and built.

CDC's Built Environment and Health Initiative is the only source of federal
expertise to help states and communities integrate health considerations into
transportation and community planning. Strategic community design can increase
physical activity, reduce injuries, improve air and water quality, and
minimize contributions to climate change.

### Public Health in Action

**Asthma Control in Maryland**

The Maryland Asthma Control Program launched the Asthma Friendly Child Care
program in the spring of 2012. Immediately, more than 50 child care providers
expressed interest in participating in the program. The voluntary program
offers education on how to create healthy environments for children with
asthma, such as having asthma action plans on file for each child. The asthma
program trains child care providers on how they can achieve an official
asthma-friendly designation. By summer of 2013, more than 150 providers have
completed the training, which is also available to Head Start and after-school
programs.

**Lead Poisoning Prevention in Maryland ***

The following is a description of activities carried out in in previous years
with the support of CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program when it was fully
funded:

From 1992 through 2011, the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE)
Lead Poisoning Prevention Program used CDC funding for childhood lead
poisoning case management and surveillance. In 2011, 452 (0.4%) children
younger than age 6 were identified with blood lead levels of 5 μg/dL or
greater. Hundreds of children with blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL received
medical and environmental case management and dozens of properties received
environmental inspections.To address lead poisoning more effectively, MDE
collected additional data on public health dangers in the home using CDC's
Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Surveillance System. In 2011, MDE
identified zip codes of children with elevated blood lead levels and
recommended state and local actions to increase practices to reduce lead
exposure. For example, the state increased its authority to issue abatement
orders.

Nine local housing code offices in Maryland are trained in the primary
prevention components of lead risk reduction. These offices notify MDE of
property owners that cannot demonstrate compliance with MDE's Lead Rental
Property Registration and risk reduction treatments for rental units built
before 1950. Baltimore trains housing inspectors in lead risk reduction.

Local health departments and the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, in
conjunction with MDE, regularly provide education to high-risk tenants,
residence owners, and the public on how to reduce exposure to lead hazards.
MDE posts lead violations on its Lead Poisoning Prevention Program website and
also provides informational resources and issues the "The Lead Leader"
newsletter that provides updates on legislation concerning lead hazards.

Baltimore's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program reaches out to and
trains pregnant women on healthy housing practices as part of the city's
Primary Prevention Initiative (Stork's Nest). As of 2011, the Stork's Nest
program had reached 175 high-risk pregnant women. The program will also
provide 100 pregnant women with assistance in obtaining lead hazard reduction
treatments for their homes.

Baltimore also pilot-tested the Green and Healthy Housing Initiative. This
innovative program links weatherizing homes and making them more energy
efficient with methods of addressing common health hazards found in housing.
It is a model for other programs across the country in integrating lead
poisoning prevention into a broader healthy homes approach.

**Tracking Environmental Hazards in Maryland**

Community concerns about cancer and potential links to environmental hazards
occur relatively frequently in Maryland. Before the Maryland Tracking Program
began in 2002, the state had no systematic way to respond to frequently asked
questions about cancer and the environment.

The Tracking Program, working with the Maryland Cancer Registry, geocoded all
residential addresses in the Registry. Now the Maryland Cancer Registry can
show cancer data accurately in maps and carry out geospatial analyses of
cancer information. Also, for the first time, there is an established process
for evaluation of cancer concerns in Maryland, a process that coordinates
between the Maryland Cancer Registry, Center for Environmental Health
Coordination, Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), and local health
departments. Information and data from this effort are now available on the
Maryland Tracking Program's websiteExternal.

The Tracking Program has worked with the Maryland Cancer Registry on two major
cancer investigations. One in Poolesville looked at concerns about cancer and
drinking water; another in Frederick involved concerns about cancer in a
community. In both cases, the Maryland Tracking Program provided maps showing
the geographic distribution of cancer and geostatistical analyses of the
cancer cases. The results of these two investigations were presented at
community meetings. To date, there is no evidence of the existence of cancer
clusters, but experts were able to answer questions from community residents.

Tracking

Tracking data are available on several health indicators, including asthma,
birth defects, carbon monoxide, childhood blood lead levels, and heart
attacks.

They participated in workshops, analyzed data, or consulted on policy recommendations.

**Supporting Built Environment and Health in Baltimore**

CDC supported the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) in promoting health
impact assessments (HIA). These allow policy makers and health officials to
evaluate the potential health effects of a plan, project, or policy before it
is built or implemented. HIAs can provide recommendations to improve public
health and minimize negative health effects.

CDC supported BCHD in HIA training for 25 senior leaders from city agencies to
kick off the city's capacity building project. BCHD also trained 35 persons
involved in its 2012 HIAs. These HIAs were later incorporated into the
curriculum of a Johns Hopkins masters' level public health course on HIAs.
Three of the city's HIA projects were made possible by CDC funding and

To further the success of the first year of its CDC-funded program, BCHD
developed an interagency health and equity impact policy workgroup of mid- to
senior-level staff from all major city agencies.

The city used the options provided in its HIA to propose a revision of its
zoning code to reduce the number of liquor stores in residential areas. If the
legislation passes, the city will phase out about 100 liquor stores that do
not meet the new zoning requirements.
