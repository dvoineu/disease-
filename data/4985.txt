# Bathroom safety - children

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

To prevent accidents in the bathroom, never leave your child alone in the
bathroom. When the bathroom is not being used, keep the door closed.

## Bathtub Safety

Children younger than 6 years old should NOT be left unattended in the
bathtub. They should also not be in the bathroom alone if there is water in
the bathtub.

Empty the tub after baths. Make sure the tub is empty before you leave the
bathroom.

Older siblings bathing with younger ones should NOT be put in charge of a
younger child's safety. There should be an adult in the bathroom during bath
time.

## Preventing Falls

Prevent slipping in the tub by using non-skid decals or a rubber mat inside
the tub. Dry the floor and your child's feet after a bath to prevent slips.
Teach your child never to run in the bathroom because of the risk of slipping
on a wet floor.

Encourage your child to stay seated during their bath by providing bath toys
or a bath seat.

## Preventing Burns

Prevent injuries or burns from faucets by covering the spout, blocking your
child's reach to the spout, and teaching your child not to touch the spout.

Keep the temperature on your hot water heater set below 120Â°F (49Â°C). Or,
install an anti-scald valve to prevent the water from going above 120Â°F
(49Â°C).

## Preventing Other Injuries

Keep other items in your bathroom that may hurt your child out of their reach.
These include:

    * Shaving razors
    * Radios
    * Hair dryers
    * Curling irons 

Keep all electronic items unplugged while your child is in the bathroom. Store
all cleaning products out of the bathroom or in a locked cabinet.

## Preventing Drug Accidents

Any medicines kept in the bathroom should be stored in a locked cabinet. This
includes medicines that were bought without a prescription.

Keep all medicines in their original bottles, which should have childproof
caps.

## Preventing Drowning

Place a lid lock on the toilet to prevent a curious toddler from drowning.

Never leave a child unattended around large buckets of water. Empty buckets
after using them.

Make sure grandparents, friends, and other caretakers follow bathroom safety
guidelines. Make sure your child's daycare also follows these guidelines.
