## Summary

Screenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms.
Screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat. You can
get some screenings in your doctor's office. Others need special equipment, so
you may need to go to a different office or clinic.

Some conditions that doctors commonly screen for include

    * Breast cancer and cervical cancer in women
    * Colorectal cancer
    * Diabetes
    * High blood pressure
    * High cholesterol
    * Osteoporosis
    * Overweight and obesity
    * Prostate cancer in men

Which tests you need depends on your age, your sex, your family history, and
whether you have risk factors for certain diseases. After a screening test,
ask when you will get the results and whom to talk to about them.
