## Summary

Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited developmental
disability. A problem with a specific gene causes the disease. Normally, the
gene makes a protein you need for brain development. But the problem causes a
person to make little or none of the protein. This causes the symptoms of
Fragile X.

People with only a small change in the gene might not show any signs of
Fragile X. People with bigger changes can have severe symptoms. These might
include

    * Intelligence problems, ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual disabilities
    * Social and emotional problems, such as aggression in boys or shyness in girls
    * Speech and language problems, especially in boys

A genetic blood test can diagnose Fragile X. There is no cure. You can treat
some symptoms with educational, behavioral, or physical therapy, and with
medicines. Getting treatment early can help.
