Earlobe creases are lines in the surface of earlobe of a child or young adult.
The surface is otherwise smooth.

## Considerations

The earlobes of children and young adults are normally smooth. Creases are
sometimes linked with conditions that are passed down through families. Other
genetic factors, such as race and earlobe shape, may also determine who
develops earlobe creasing and when it occurs.

It is not uncommon to have one small abnormality in facial features, such as
an earlobe crease. Most often, this does not indicate a serious medical
condition.

## Causes

In children, earlobe creases are sometimes linked with rare disorders. One of
these is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

In most cases, the health care provider will notice earlobe creases during a
regular checkup.

Talk to your provider if you are concerned that your child's earlobe creases
may be linked to an inherited disorder.

## What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The provider will examine your child and ask questions about medical history
and symptoms. These may include:

      * When did you first notice the earlobe creases?
      * What other symptoms or problems have you also noticed? 

Tests depend on the symptoms.
