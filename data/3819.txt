In general, the risk of youth experiencing these problems is greater for those
who binge drink than for those who do not binge drink.10,11

Early initiation of drinking is associated with development of an alcohol use
disorder later in life.12

#### Prevention of Underage Drinking

Publications by the Surgeon General1 and the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine)5
outline many prevention strategies for the prevention of underage drinking,
such as enforcement of minimum legal drinking age laws, national media
campaigns targeting youth and adults, increasing alcohol excise taxes,
reducing youth exposure to alcohol advertising, and development of
comprehensive community-based programs.
