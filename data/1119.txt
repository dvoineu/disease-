### Using SHPPS Data

2016 Data Files and Methods

### SHPPS 2016 Data Files, Methods and File Naming

SHPPS 2016 data include 5 questionnaires, 5 data files, and 5 codebooks. Files
are grouped by district and by component.

### Data Files and Methods

School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) data are available in three
file formats: Access®, SPSS® and ASCII. The Access, SPSS, and ASCII data can
be downloaded and used as is. Additionally, SAS® programs are provided to
convert the ASCII data into SAS datasets for use in those packages.

## File Names

File names include SHPPS_ followed by three parts. The first part identifies
the component, the second part identifies the level, and the third part
indicates the survey year.

**Component** | **Part**  
---|---  
Health education | hlthed  
Physical education and activity | physed  
Health services | hlthser  
Healthy and safe school environment | env  
Nutrition services | nutr  
Status | status  
**Level** | **Part**  
District | d  
  
The questionnaire and codebook files use the same naming convention but add
the words "questionnaire" or "codebook" to the file name.

For example, the files for health education at the district level would be:

Health education file | Name  
---|---  
SPSS data | SHPPS_hlthed2016.sav  
Questionnaire | SHPPS_hlthed2016questionnaire.pdf  
Codebook | SHPPS_hlthed2016codebook.pdf

2012 Data Files and Methods

### SHPPS 2012 Data Files, Methods and File Naming

SHPPS 2012 data include 13 questionnaires, 15 data files, and 15 codebooks.
Files are grouped by administration level (state and district) and by
component.

### Data Files and Methods

School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) data are available in three
file formats: Access®, SPSS® and ASCII. The Access, SPSS, and ASCII data can
be downloaded and used as is. Additionally, SAS® programs are provided to
convert the ASCII data into SAS datasets for use in those packages.

## File Names

File names include SHPPS_ followed by three parts. The first part identifies
the component, the second part identifies the level, and the third part
indicates the survey year.

**Component** | **Part**  
---|---  
Health education | hlthed  
Physical education and activity | physed  
Health services | hlthser  
Mental health and social services | mental  
Healthy and safe school environment | env  
Nutrition services | nutr  
Faculty and staff health promotion | faculty  
Status | status  
**Level** | **Part**  
---|---  
State | s  
District | d  
  


The questionnaire and codebook files use the same naming convention but add
the words "questionnaire" or "codebook" to the file name.

For example, the files for health education at the state level would be:

Health education file | Name  
---|---  
SPSS data | SHPPS_hlthes2012.sav  
Questionnaire | SHPPS_hlthes2012questionnaire.pdf  
Codebook | SHPPS_hlthes2012codebook.pdf  
  
2012 Status Files

### Status Files

The status files contain additional information for the component-specific
datasets. There are two status files, one for each level (state and district).
The status files contain

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Enrollment information
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Region of country
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Overall weight variable to be used when the datasets are combined across components

Each status file contains a specific variable that needs to be used to link
its associated dataset. For example, to link the state status file with
another SHPPS state-level dataset, the variable STCMSID is used.

Using ASCII Files

### **Using ASCII Files**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. Save the ASCII data file to a folder on your computer.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Specify column locations for each variable as needed by the software you are using.

**Note:** How to use the ASCII data varies from one software package to
another. Column positions for each variable usually have to be specified.
Column positions for each variable can be found in the documentation for each
year's data. Consult your software documentation for more information.

Run the program. This will read the ASCII data file and convert it into a permanent SAS dataset for the particular year in the folder specified in the SAS program.

**Note:** Each year of SHPPS data should go in its own folder because each
year has its own format library. Format libraries are not comparable across
years. See Using the SAS Format Library for more information.

Using the SAS Format Library

## SAS Format Library

The SAS format library contains the formats used to make SAS output more
readable. Formats are linked to the data so results are displayed as words
("Yes" or "No", for instance) instead of numbers (1 or 2). The SAS SHPPS data
files are designed to use the companion format library. You should download
both the data file and the format library if you want to use SAS to analyze
SHPPS data. One format library is used for all the SHPPS 2016 data, and
another is used for all the SHPPS 2012 and 2014 data.

The following example SAS program shows how to use the format library. It
assumes that both the data file and the format library have been downloaded to
"c:data". Note that the program contains two libname statements. The first
libname statement indicates where the data file is located; the second libname
statement indicates where the format library is located.

**General example:**

libname mydata 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the data are */  
libname library 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the formats are */

proc freq data=mydata.<name of SAS data file>;  
tables <variable name>;

run;  
  
---  
  
**SHPPS specific example using the district level health education data and
running a table for the variable HED1:**

libname mydata 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the data are */  
libname library 'c:data'; /* tells SAS where the formats are */

proc freq data=mydata hlthedd;  
tables HED1;

run;  
  
---  
  
Using the format library is recommended but technically is optional. If you do
not want to use the format library, include the following statement at the
start of your SAS program:

options nofmterr; /*  tells SAS to not look for formats */  
  
---  
  
Please note that each year of SHPPS data has its own format library that can
be downloaded from the Using SAS Files section.

For further information on using format libraries, please refer to the
documentation provided with the SAS system.
