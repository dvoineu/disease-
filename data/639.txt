                    * The outbreak strain was also identified in samples of raw chicken collected from two facilities, including one facility that processes Empire Kosher brand chicken.

Advice to Consumers and Retailers

![Illustration of a clipboard with check marks on
it.](/salmonella/images/outbreaks/clipboard.jpg)

**Always handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food
poisoning. This outbreak was a reminder that raw chicken products can have
germs that spread around food preparation areas and can make you sick.**

**CDC is not advising that people avoid eating kosher chicken or Empire Kosher
brand chicken.**

CDC advises consumers to follow these steps to help prevent _Salmonella_
infection from raw chicken:

                    * **Wash hands before and after preparing raw chicken.**
                    * **Don 't spread germs from raw chicken around food preparation areas.** Washing raw poultry before cooking is not recommendedExternal. Germs in raw poultry juices can spread to other areas and foods. Thoroughly wash hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils with warm, soapy water after they touch raw chicken. Use a separate cutting board for raw chicken and other raw meats if possible.
                    * **Cook raw chicken thoroughly to kill harmful germs.** Chicken breasts, whole chickens, and ground chicken should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should be reheated to 165°F. Use a food thermometer to check, and place it in the thickest part of the foodExternal.

Symptoms of _Salmonella_ Infection

![Illustration of a person with stomach
pain.](/salmonella/images/outbreaks/symptoms.jpg)

                    * Most people infected with _Salmonella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria.
                    * The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment.
                    * In some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. _Salmonella_ infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other places in the body.
                    * In rare cases, _Salmonella_ infection can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.
                    * Children younger than 5 years of age, adults older than 65 years of age, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe illness.
                    * For more information, see the CDC __Salmonella__ website.

Investigation Details

#### December 7, 2018

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-
FSIS)External investigated a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ I
4,[5],12:i:- infections linked to kosher chicken.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses
that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of
public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA
fingerprinting was performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people
by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole
genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA
fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA
fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria from ill people
in this outbreak showed that these _Salmonella_ strains are closely related
genetically. This means that the ill people were more likely to share a common
source of infection.

As of December 4, 2018, a total of 25 people infected with the outbreak strain
of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- were reported from six states. A list of the
states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported
Cases page.

Illnesses started on dates from September 25, 2017, to August 13, 2018. Ill
people ranged in age from less than one year to 76, with a median age of 16.
Fifty percent of ill people are female. Of 22 people with information
available, 11 (50%) were hospitalized, including a death reported from New
York.

WGS analysis did not predict any antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_
bacteria isolated from 21 ill people and 6 chicken samples. Testing of 6
clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by
CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory
also showed no resistance.

#### Investigation of the Outbreak

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and
other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 20 people interviewed,
20 (100%) reported eating chicken products. Of 12 people who reported brand
information, 10 (83%) reported specifically eating Empire Kosher brand
chicken.

The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- was identified in samples
from raw chicken collected at two facilities, including one that processes
Empire Kosher brand chicken. The samples collected by USDA-FSIS at the
slaughter and processing establishment were part of USDA-FSIS' routine testing
under the _Salmonella_ performance standards. WGS showed that the _Salmonella_
strain from these samples is closely related genetically to the _Salmonella_
strain from ill people.

Available data indicated that some kosher chicken products were contaminated
with this strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- and made people sick.
Consumers should always follow steps to prevent _Salmonella_ infection from
these products.

As of December 7, 2018, this outbreak investigation is over.
