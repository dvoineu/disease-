## Summary

Medicaid is government health insurance that helps many low-income people in
the United States to pay their medical bills. The Federal government sets up
general guidelines for the program, but each state has its own rules. Your
state might require you to pay a part of the cost for some medical services.

You have to meet certain requirements to get Medicaid help. These might
involve

    * Your age
    * Whether you are pregnant, disabled, or blind
    * Your income and resources
    * Whether or not you are a U.S. citizen or, if not, what your immigration status is
