## Summary

There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you
don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and
between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as
gum disease, dry mouth, or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems
with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some
foods, like raw onions, garlic, or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its
own bad smell. Some diseases and medicines can cause a specific breath odor.

Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight
bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If
you have a disease that causes the bad breath, treating the disease may help
give you fresher breath.
