# Cervical Cancer Awareness

This short animated video reminds women that getting screened for cervical
cancer helps prevent the disease.

**You can lower your risk for cervical cancer by getting screened regularly,
starting at age 21.**

## Screening Tests

Two tests help prevent cervical cancer or find it early--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for _precancers,_ which are cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * The human papillomavirus (HPV) test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes.

## Screening Options

Worried about the cost?

If you have a low income or don't have health insurance, you may qualify for
free or low-cost cervical cancer screening through CDC's National Breast and
Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.

You should get your first Pap test at age 21. If your test result is normal,
you can wait three years for your next test.

If you're 30 years old or older, you have three options--

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * You can continue getting a **Pap test only.** If your test result is normal, you can wait three years for your next test.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * You can get an **HPV test only.** If your test result is normal, you can wait five years for your next test.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * You can get **both an HPV and Pap test together.** If your test results are normal, you can wait five years for your next tests.

## HPV Vaccine

The HPV vaccine protects against the types of HPV that most often cause
cervical cancers. HPV can also cause other kinds of cancer in both men and
women.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * HPV vaccination is recommended for preteens aged 11 to 12 years, but can be given starting at age 9.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * HPV vaccine also is recommended for everyone through age 26 years, if they are not vaccinated already.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * HPV vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get the HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination. HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, as more people have already been exposed to HPV.

HPV vaccination prevents new HPV infections, but does not treat existing
infections or diseases. This is why the HPV vaccine works best when given
before any exposure to HPV. **You should get screened for cervical cancer
regularly, even if you received an HPV vaccine.**
