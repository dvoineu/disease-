## Summary

Most young children get sick. It is hard for parents to know what is serious.
You can learn what the common warning signs are. In the end, trust your
intuition. If you are worried about your toddler, call your health care
provider right away.

Well-child visits are important to your toddler's health. Toddlers will get
their recommended immunizations during these visits. Routine exams and
screenings help you and your kids prevent and treat health problems as well as
chart their growth and development.
