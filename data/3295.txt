A tracheal or bronchial rupture is a tear or break in the windpipe (trachea)
or bronchial tubes, the major airways leading to the lungs. A tear can also
occur in the tissue lining the windpipe.

## Causes

The injury may be caused by:

    * Infections
    * Sores (ulcerations) due to foreign objects
    * Trauma, such as a gunshot wound or automobile accident

Injuries to the trachea or bronchi also may occur during medical procedures
(for example,Â bronchoscopy and placement of a breathing tube). However, this
is very uncommon.

## Symptoms

People with trauma who develop a tracheal or bronchial rupture often have
other injuries.

Symptoms may include:

    * Coughing up blood
    * Bubbles of air that can be felt underneath the skin of the chest, neck, arms, and trunk (subcutaneous emphysema) 
    * Difficulty breathing 

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Close attention will be
paid to the symptoms of the rupture.

Tests that may be done include:

    * Neck CT scan
    * Chest x-ray
    * Bronchoscopy
    * CT angiography
    * Laryngoscopy
    * Contrast esophagography and esophagoscopy

## Treatment

People who have had a trauma will need to have their injuries treated.
Injuries to the trachea often need to be repaired during surgery. Injuries to
the smaller bronchi can sometimes be treated without surgery. A collapsed lung
is treated with a chest tube connected to suction, which re-expands the lung.

For people who have breathed a foreign body into the airways, bronchoscopy may
be used to take out the object.

Antibiotics are used in people with an infection in the part of the lung
around the injury.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Outlook of injury due to trauma depends on the severity of other injuries.
Operations to repair these injuries often have good results. Outlook is good
for people whose tracheal or bronchial disruption is due to causes such as a
foreign object, which tend toÂ have a good outcome.

In the months or years after the injury, scarring at the injury site may cause
problems, such as narrowing, which require other tests or procedures.

## Possible Complications

Major complications after surgery for this condition include:

    * Infection
    * Long-term need of a ventilator
    * Narrowing of the airways
    * Scarring

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have:

    * Had a major injury to the chest
    * Inhaled a foreign body
    * Symptoms of a chest infection
    * The feeling of air bubbles underneath your skin and trouble breathing

## Alternative Names

Torn tracheal mucosa; Bronchial rupture
