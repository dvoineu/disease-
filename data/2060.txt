## Summary

A normal pregnancy lasts nine months. Each three-month period of pregnancy is
called a trimester. During each trimester, the fetus grows and develops.
Regular medical checkups and prenatal tests are very important. They can

    * Help keep you and your baby healthy
    * Spot problems with your baby (if there are any). In some cases, health care professionals can treat the problem before your baby is born. But even when they cannot, it can still be helpful to know about the problem early on. That gives you time to learn about your baby's condition and prepare for any challenges you may face after the baby is born.
    * Prevent problems during delivery. For example, if your baby is breech (bottom first or feet first, instead of head first), you may need to have a Cesarean section to avoid complications.

Besides getting medical care, there are other things you can do to keep your
baby as healthy as possible. It's important not to drink or smoke. Try to eat
a healthy diet and make sure to take care of any health problems you have
during pregnancy.
