**This interim guidance may be updated based upon new data if indicated.**

### Background and Rationale

In the wake of the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West
Africa from 2014 to 2016, and with the improvements seen in supportive care
delivery in field settings, there are now many EVD survivors, including those
experiencing sequelae of the disease. Of the eleven patients with EVD who were
managed in U.S. healthcare facilities during 2014-2015, nine survived. It is
possible that some EVD survivors  could seek medical care in the U.S. The
purpose of this document is to provide:

Data on the pathogenesis of sequelae in EVD survivors and complications
related to viral persistence are very limited; few data are available from
animal models. In most cases, persons who have completely recovered from EVD
do not experience a relapse of EVD associated with systemic illness. However,
in 2015, one nurse who recovered from acute EVD infection experienced a
relapse of EVD.1

Survivors can experience complications after surviving acute EVD. The timing
of onset, severity, and duration of complications among EVD survivors are
variable. Reported complications among EVD survivors include non-specific
fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches, headaches, suppurative parotitis,
pericarditis, orchitis, sexual dysfunction, hair loss, vision loss (including
uveitis and permanent blindness), hearing loss, tinnitus, paresthesia or
dysesthesia, memory loss, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder2-10).

Ebola virus (EBOV) can persist for several months after acute infection in
organs that are considered "immunologically privileged sites" - sites that are
shielded from the survivor's immune system (e.g., testes, eye, central nervous
system). EBOV was isolated from a semen specimen collected 82 days after acute
EVD onset from a male survivor12. Molecular evidence suggested sexual
transmission of EBOV from an asymptomatic male survivor to a female partner
179 days after the survivor's EVD onset13. The potential for residual
infectious risk from EBOV persistence is further highlighted by recovery of
infectious EBOV in cerebrospinal fluid collected at 282 days after EVD onset
from a survivor who experienced late onset of meningoencephalitis signs and
symptoms 14, and isolation of EBOV from an intraocular fluid specimen of an
eye affected by panuveitis collected at 14 weeks after EVD onset 15, It is
unknown whether EBOV can persist in synovial fluid with or without
accompanying arthritis. Table 1 summarizes data available to date on detection
of EBOV RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or
recovery of viable EBOV in viral culture from different clinical specimens.

The risk of infectivity from patients with persistent infection is unknown but
appears to be low and is likely to decrease over time. Because patients who
recover from acute EVD and later become ill with neurological or ocular
symptoms might have persistent EBOV replication, appropriate infection control
practices such as those recommended for evaluating persons under investigation
for EVD should be adhered to until EBOV testing is negative. This also
includes any situations where there is the possibility of contact with spinal
fluid, semen, or ocular contents (e.g., lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia,
prostate or testicular surgery, and intraocular procedures).

EVD survivors who have any new or recurrent ocular or neurologic symptoms
should seek care for complications associated with potential EBOV persistence.
EVD survivors with fever should be assessed for both common community-acquired
infections (e.g., malaria, influenza, common cold, typhoid fever,
gastroenteritis, etc.), as well as possible complications related to EBOV
persistence.

### Guidance for Clinical Assessment of EVD Survivors

All patient care delivery (i.e., in patients both known and not known to be
EVD survivors) should be performed using Standard Precautions. These
constitute the minimum set of infection control practices used to ensure that
healthcare personnel do not contract infections from patients, whether or not
they are known to be infectious, and that personnel do not spread infectious
material to other patients during routine medical care†

For patients who fully recovered from EVD and subsequently seek medical care
(EVD survivors who have recovered and been discharged after their acute EVD
clinical course):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Standard Precautions† and correct waste management should remain in effect while appropriate clinical evaluation and care is performed. Based on observations during the 2014 West African EVD outbreak and previous outbreaks, there is no current evidence that the routine clinical care of EVD survivors poses any special risk to healthcare personnel when this care involves contact with intact skin, sweat, tears, conjunctivae, saliva, or cerumen.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Women who become pregnant after recovery should receive routine prenatal care. Standard Precautions* and correct waste management should be used during labor and delivery with attention paid to splash prevention. In the absence of neurologic symptoms, regional anesthesia should not pose a risk to hospital staff. (For those pregnant survivors with neurologic symptoms who require spinal anesthesia during delivery, see below). Available evidence indicates that persons who have fully recovered from EVD and are not febrile, do not manifest EBOV viremia and do not pose a risk of EBOV exposure through phlebotomy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Specific procedures that create the opportunity for contact with body fluids from immunologically protected sites merit special consideration. Although data are limited, there is recognized potential for virus persistence in certain body fluids and tissues as summarized in Table 1. Examples include: obtaining and handling CSF from an EVD survivor with CNS symptoms; performing an invasive ophthalmologic procedure on an affected eye in a patient with ocular disease such as uveitis or cataract; and procedures involving exposure to semen, such as infertility evaluations, or performing invasive procedures on the testes, prostate gland, or seminal vesicles. It is unknown whether EBOV may persist in synovial fluid of survivors. For these and any other care activities that might involve contact with such body fluids (including lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia), healthcare facilities and clinicians should:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Determine appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on a risk assessment of potential exposure during the procedure(s) and related care and ensure training on its use. Based on these assessments, and in consultation with public health authorities, safe care delivery can be arranged either at the original facility or, at the discretion of local and State public health authorities and in consultation with CDC, at an appropriate referral facility.

The continued need for these additional recommendations will presumably
diminish over time; this guidance will be updated accordingly as more
information becomes available.

_†Standard Precautions_ _include the minimum practices that apply to all
patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status of the
patient, in any setting where healthcare is delivered. These practices are
designed to both protect HCP and prevent HCP from spreading infections among
patients. Standard Precautions include: 1) hand hygiene, 2) use of personal
protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, masks) when there is any potential
for contact with blood, body fluids or broken skin*, 3) safe injection
practices, 4) safe handling of potentially contaminated equipment or surfaces
in the patient environment, and 5) respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette._

_*Healthcare personnel should use precautions when there is potential contact
with blood, body fluids or broken skin, and any potential for splashing or
exposure to a soiled surface during care, for which non-sterile gloves,
disposable gowns, and face protection to prevent mucosal exposure should be
used based on the expected risk._
