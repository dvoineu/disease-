## Summary

The rectum is the lower part of your large intestine where your body stores
stool. Problems with rectum are common. They include hemorrhoids, abscesses,
incontinence and cancer.

Many people are embarrassed to talk about rectal troubles. But seeing your
doctor about problems in this area is important. This is especially true if
you have pain or bleeding. Treatments vary depending on the particular
problem.
