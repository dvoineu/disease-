### Information for 2016-2017

Getting an annual flu vaccine is the first and best way to protect yourself
and your family from the flu. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses,
doctors' visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent
flu-related hospitalizations. Increasing the number of people who get
vaccinated each year helps to protect more people, including older people,
very young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions
who are more vulnerable to serious flu complications. This page summarizes
information for the 2016-2017 flu season.

Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) - or the nasal spray vaccine - is
**not** recommended for use during the 2016-2017 season because of concerns
about its effectiveness.

There is a table showing all the influenza vaccines that are FDA-approved for
use in the United States during the 2016-2017 season.

#### What viruses do 2016-2017 flu vaccines protect against?

There are many flu viruses and they are constantly changing. The composition
of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated to match circulating flu
viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on
the type of flu vaccine) that research suggests will be most common. For
2016-2017, three-component vaccines are recommended to contain:

Four component vaccines are recommended to include the same three viruses
above, plus an additional B virus called B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus
(B/Yamagata lineage).

#### When and how often should I get vaccinated?

You should get a flu vaccine before flu viruses begins spreading in your
community, since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to
develop in the body and provide protection against flu. Make plans to get
vaccinated early in fall, before flu season begins. CDC recommends that people
get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Getting vaccinated later, however,
can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered
throughout the flu season, even into January or later.

Getting vaccinated early (for example, in July or August) is likely to be
associated with reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu
season, particularly among older adults.

Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the
vaccination process sooner, because the two doses must be given at least four
weeks apart.

#### Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs?

The recommendations for people with egg allergies have been updated for this
season.

### Flu Activity

#### What sort of flu season are we experiencing?

As of a flu activity update published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report on February 17, 2017, flu activity during the 2016-2017 season had been
moderate, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating and severity
indicators within the range of what has been seen during previous seasons that
were H3N2-predominant. H3N2-predominant seasons have been associated with more
severe illness and mortality, especially in older people and young children,
relative to seasons during which H1N1 or B viruses predominated.

#### Have new flu viruses circulated this season?

Flu viruses are constantly changing so it's not unusual for new flu viruses to
appear each year. However, as of the February 2017 MMWR, most of the influenza
viruses analyzed this season have remained like the vaccine viruses
recommended for production of Northern Hemisphere vaccines. For more
information about how flu viruses change, visit How the Flu Virus Can Change.

#### Is the United States having a flu epidemic?

The United States experiences epidemics of seasonal flu each year. This time
of year is called "flu season." In the United States, flu viruses are most
common during the fall and winter months. Influenza activity often begins to
increase in October and November. Most of the time flu activity peaks between
December and March and can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu
indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI),
the results of laboratory testing and flu hospitalization and deaths). When
these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks,
flu season is said to have begun. Usually ILI increases first, followed by an
increase in flu-associated hospitalizations, which is then followed by
increases in flu-associated deaths. During 2016-2017, influenza-like-illness
(ILI) went above baseline the week ending December 17, 2016.

Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report.

#### When did flu activity begin and when will it peak?

The timing of flu is very unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the
country and from season to season. Seasonal flu viruses can be detected year-
round; however, seasonal flu activity can begin as early as October and
continue to occur as late as May. Flu activity most commonly peaks in the
United States between December and March.

For the 2016-2017 season, influenza-like-illness (ILI) in the United States
went above baseline the week ending December 17, 2016 and remained elevated as
of mid-March. The season has likely peaked.

#### How many people die from flu each year?

CDC does not count how many people die from flu each year. Unlike flu deaths
in children, flu deaths in adults are not nationally reportable. However, CDC
uses mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics to
monitor relative levels of flu-associated deaths. This system tracks the
proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as
the underlying or contributing cause of death of the total deaths reported.
This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths
are elevated, but does not provide an exact number of how many people died
from flu. For more information, see Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the
United States, "Mortality Surveillance."

CDC also uses modeling studies to estimate numbers of flu-related deaths, but
these studies apply only to past seasons and are not done each year. For more
information, see Estimating Seasonal Influenza-Associated Deaths in the United
States.

#### Why is it difficult to know how many people die from flu?

There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers
of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting. Some of the challenges in
counting influenza-associated deaths include the following: the sheer volume
of deaths to be counted; the lack of testing (not everyone that dies with an
influenza-like illness is tested for influenza); and the different coding of
deaths (influenza-associated deaths are often a result of complications
secondary to underlying medical problems, and this may be difficult to sort
out). For more information, see Estimating Seasonal Influenza-Associated
Deaths in the United States: CDC Study Confirms Variability of Flu.

### Protective Actions

#### What should I do to protect myself from flu this season?

CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as
the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease.

In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday
preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands
to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work
or school to prevent spreading flu to others. In addition, there are
prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat
influenza illness. Visit What you Should Know About Flu Antiviral Drugs for
more information.

#### What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season?

Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated. Vaccination is especially
important for people at high risk for developing flu-related complications,
and their close contacts. Also, if you have a loved one who is at high risk of
flu complications and they develop flu symptoms, encourage them to get a
medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs. CDC
recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications who
get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as
quickly as possible. People who are not at high risk for serious flu
complications may also be treated with antiviral drugs, especially if
treatment can begin within 48 hours.

Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu
vaccine for adequate protection from flu. Children in this age group who are
getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine,
spaced at least 28 days apart. Some children who have received flu vaccine
previously and children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also
may need two doses. Your child's doctor or other health care professional can
tell you if your child needs two doses. Visit Children, the Flu, and the Flu
Vaccine for more information.

Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu
complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because of this,
safeguarding them from flu is especially important. If you live with or care
for an infant younger than 6 months of age, you should get a flu vaccine to
help protect them from flu. See Advice for Caregivers of Young Children for
more information. Also, studies have shown that getting the flu vaccine during
pregnancy can protect the baby after birth for several months.

In addition to getting vaccinated, you and your loved ones can take everyday
preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands
to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work
or school to prevent spreading flu to others.

### Vaccine and Vaccination

#### How much flu vaccine is available this season?

Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on
manufacturers. For the 2016-2017 season, manufacturers projected they would
provide between 157 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for
the U.S. market. (Projections may change as the season progresses.) The
quantity of vaccine that has been distributed is updated regularly during flu
season and is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Total Doses
Distributed.

#### Is live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine (LAIV) available this
season even though it is not recommended for use?

FluMist Quadrivalent is still an FDA-licensed product. As such, there may be
some supply of FluMist Quadrivalent on the U.S. market during the 2016-2017
season. It is important for clinicians and the public to be aware that because
of concerns about this vaccine's effectiveness, CDC recommends that this
vaccine **not** be used during the 2016-2017 influenza season.

#### When did flu vaccine become available?

Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so the timing of vaccine
availability depends on when production is completed. For the 2016-2017
influenza season, by late September, more than 90 million doses of 2016-2017
flu vaccine had already been distributed in the United States.

#### Where can I get a flu vaccine?

Flu vaccines are offered by many doctor's offices, clinics, health
departments, pharmacies and college health centers, as well as by many
employers, and even by some schools.

Even if you don't have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine
somewhere else, like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, and
often your school, college health center, or work.

Visit the HealthMap Vaccine Finderexternal icon to locate where you can get a
flu vaccine.

#### Are there new recommendations for the 2016-2017 influenza season?

On June 22, 2016, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
voted that the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) should not be used
during the 2016-2017 flu season. ACIP continues to recommend annual flu
vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. The ACIP recommendation must be
reviewed and approved by CDC's director before it becomes CDC policy. The
final annual recommendations on the prevention and control of influenza with
vaccines will be published in a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
(MMWR) in late summer or early fall.

#### What is flu vaccination using a jet injector?

On August 14, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use
of one jet injector device (the PharmaJet Stratis 0.5ml Needle-free Jet
Injector) for delivery of one particular flu vaccine (AFLURIA® by bioCSL Inc.)
in people 18 through 64 years of age. A jet injector is a medical device used
for vaccination that uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate
the skin instead of a hypodermic needle. For more information, see Flu
Vaccination by Jet Injector.

#### What is adjuvanted flu vaccine?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationexternal icon (FDA) licensed a new
seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of
age and older. An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a
stronger immune response to vaccination. FLUAD™ was licensed in November 2015
and will be available during the 2016-2017 flu season. It contains the MF59
adjuvant, an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. FLUAD™ is the first
adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States. For more
information visit: FLUAD™ Flu Vaccine With Adjuvant.

#### How well will flu vaccines work this season?

Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from year-to-year among
different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type. How well the vaccine
works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine virus used to
produce the vaccine and the circulating viruses that season. It's not possible
to predict what viruses will be most predominant during the upcoming season.
CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and
updated information about the vaccine match as it becomes available.
Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Vaccine effectiveness estimates
are also provided when they become available. For more information about
vaccine effectiveness, visit How Well Does the Seasonal Flu Vaccine Work? .

Early vaccine effectiveness estimates for the 2016-2017 season indicated that
flu vaccines this season was reducing a vaccinated person's risk of getting
sick and needing medical care because of flu by about half. According to data
from the U.S. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network, interim estimates show flu
vaccine has been 48% effective in preventing medically-attended influenza A
and B illness. Interim effectiveness estimates against the predominant
influenza A (H3N2) viruses are 43% while the interim effectiveness estimate
against influenza B viruses is 73%.

These interim estimates are consistent with vaccine effectiveness (VE)
estimates from previous seasons during which vaccine viruses have been
characterized as being "like" (well-matched to) circulating viruses based on
standard characterization methods. During seasons with a less than optimal
match, reduced VE has been observed.

#### Will this season's flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses?

Historically, antigenic characterization data have been used most commonly to
assess the similarity between vaccine viruses and circulating viruses to infer
how well the flu vaccine might work until such time as vaccine effectiveness
estimates are available. Nationally, based on influenza virus isolates that
state health departments have sent to CDC that have been
antigenically/genetically characterized, laboratory testing has not identified
any evidence for a mismatch between circulating viruses and the vaccine. In
other words, the vast majority of H1N1 (100%), H3N2 (95%) and B lineage
viruses (90.6% for Victoria lineage, 100% for Yamagata lineage) are similar to
the recommended vaccine virus components for this season. This information is
published weekly in FluView.

There are, however, a small proportion of viruses that are different from the
recommended vaccine viruses in circulation at this time, and the 2016-2017
seasonal flu vaccine likely won't work as well against these viruses.
Additionally, even during seasons when circulating viruses and recommended
vaccine viruses are similar, vaccine effectiveness can vary depending on virus
type or subtype; with overall vaccine effectiveness falling somewhere between
50% and 60%. This figure is generally lower during seasons when H3N2 viruses
are predominant, such as the current season. There is ongoing work across the
federal government and the private sector to improve flu vaccine performance;
however, current flu vaccines do offer important protection against influenza.

Antiviral treatment is an important adjunct to flu vaccination. CDC's
antiviral guidance is available at Antiviral Drugs.

#### Can the flu vaccine provide protection even if the vaccine is not a
"good" match?

Yes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can
sometimes provide protection against different but related viruses. A less
than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the virus
that is different from what is in the flu vaccine, but it can still provide
some protection against flu illness.

In addition, it's important to remember that the flu vaccine contains three or
four flu viruses (depending on the type of vaccine you receive) so that even
when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one
virus, the vaccine may protect against the other viruses.

For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match,
CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older.
Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu
complications, and their close contacts.

#### How long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting the flu?

Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types
and flu virus subtypes have shown that the body's immunity to flu viruses
(acquired either through natural infection or vaccination) declines over time.
The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors, including the
antigen used in the vaccine, the age of the person being vaccinated, and the
person's general health (for example, certain chronic health conditions may
have an impact on immunity). When most healthy people with regular immune
systems are vaccinated, their bodies produce antibodies and they are protected
throughout the flu season, even as antibody levels decline over time. Older
people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same
amount of antibodies after vaccination; further, their antibody levels may
drop more quickly when compared to young, healthy people.

For everyone, getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection
against the flu throughout flu season. It's important to get a flu vaccine
every season, even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in
the vaccine have not changed for the current season.

#### Can I get vaccinated and still get the flu?

Yes. It's possible to get sick with the flu even if you have been vaccinated
(although you won't know for sure unless you get a flu test). This is possible
for the following reasons:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * You may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated. This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you. (About 2 weeks after vaccination, antibodies that provide protection develop in the body.)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * You may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine. There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year. The flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common.

Unfortunately, some people can become infected with a flu virus the flu
vaccine is designed to protect against, despite getting vaccinated. Protection
provided by flu vaccination can vary widely, based in part on health and age
factors of the person getting vaccinated. In general, the flu vaccine works
best among healthy younger adults and older children. Some older people and
people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after
vaccination. Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool, but it is the best way to
protect against flu infection.

### If You Get Sick

#### What should I do if I get sick with the flu?

Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness.
People at high risk of serious flu complications (such as children younger
than 5 years, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, people with
certain medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term
care facilities) and people who are very sick with flu (such as those
hospitalized because of flu) should get treatment with antiviral drugs as
early as possible after illness begins. Some other people may be treated with
antivirals at their health care professional's discretion. Treating high risk
people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very
important. Studies show that prompt treatment, especially within 2 days of
illness onset, with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications.
Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness
versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.

Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting
sick, but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness.
Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups. Studies show
that antiviral drugs are under-prescribed for people who are at high risk of
complications who get flu. Three FDA-approved antiviral medications are
recommended for use during the 2016-2017 flu season: oseltamivir (available as
a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), zanamivir (trade name
Relenza®), and peramivir (trade name Rapivab®). More information about
antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment - Antiviral Drugs.

See "The Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick" for more information.

#### Are there new antiviral medications available for 2016-2017?

In August 2016external icon, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
the first generic version of Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate). Generic
oseltamivir is available as a pill. Tamiflu® is available as a pill or liquid.

### Surveillance

#### How does CDC track flu activity?

The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC
collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the
United States and produces FluView, a weekly influenza surveillance report,
and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of flu
surveillance data. The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative
effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial
health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics
offices, health care providers, clinics, and emergency departments.
Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources
that allow CDC to:

#### Are there any new FluView interactive applications?

Yes. A new FluView interactive application was introduced over the summer of
2016 that shows the distribution by age group of flu-positive tests by flu
virus type and subtype or lineage. This application allows users to view
laboratory data from multiple seasons and different age groups. Users also can
view the chart data by week or cumulatively for the season. The new FluView
application shows the distribution by age group of flu-positive specimens from
the 1997-1998 flu season through the current week of reporting. Influenza B
lineage information is available starting from the 2015-16 season. It's
important to note, however, that because testing practices and the number of
participating public health laboratories can change from year to year; it is
not always appropriate to determine the relative severity of flu seasons by
comparing the number of positive specimens across seasons.

#### What is CDC doing to monitor vaccine effectiveness for the 2016-2017
season?

CDC collaborates with other partners each season to assess how well the
seasonal vaccines are working. During the 2016-2017 season, CDC is planning
multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots. These studies measure
vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among
persons 6 months of age and older. A summary of CDC's latest vaccine
effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine
Effectiveness, 2005-2016.

#### What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States
during the 2016-2017 season?

CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an
established network of domestic and global surveillance systems. CDC also is
working with the state public health departments and the World Health
Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the
United States and worldwide. The information collected will assist in making
informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza.

### Flu and Parotitis

#### What is acute parotitis?

Acute parotitis is recent swelling of one of the salivary glands. It can be
caused by a number of things, including viruses and bacteria. Acute viral
parotitis is not a common symptom of flu virus infection and is much more
commonly seen following infection with the mumps virus.

#### How common is acute parotitis with flu?

We don't know exactly how commonly parotitis occurs with flu. Prior to 2014,
roughly a dozen cases were reported in the scientific literature. However,
during the 2014-2015 flu season in the United States, several hundred cases
were reported to CDC, representing the largest number of reported cases ever.

#### Who is at risk of developing acute parotitis after flu?

Parotitis after flu appears to occur in people of all ages but mostly in
school-aged children and more commonly in males. While still rare, flu-
associated parotitis appears to occur more often after infection with
influenza A (H3N2) viruses.

#### What should I do if I have acute parotitis, or swollen salivary glands?

If you think you have swollen salivary glands, you should see your health care
provider as this may be due to a blockage or may be a symptom of an infection,
like mumps or flu, which could spread to others. Your health care provider may
test you for an infection and tell you to stay home, or self-isolate, until
the swelling has gone done or your symptoms have resolved. Depending on the
cause of the swelling, treatment may be recommended.
