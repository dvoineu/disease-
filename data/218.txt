## Summary

Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. If you have it, your immune system
attacks healthy cells in your skin and mouth, causing blisters and sores. No
one knows the cause. Pemphigus does not spread from person to person. It does
not appear to be inherited. But some people's genes put them more at risk for
pemphigus.

Pemphigoid is also an autoimmune skin disease. It leads to deep blisters that
do not break easily. Pemphigoid is most common in older adults and may be
fatal for older, sick patients.

Doctors diagnose pemphigus with a physical exam, a biopsy, and blood tests.
The treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid is the same: one or more medicines
to control symptoms. These may include

  * Steroids, which reduce inflammation
  * Drugs that suppress the immune system response
  * Antibiotics to treat associated infections
