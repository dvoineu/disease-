Adult body lice are 2.3-3.6 mm in length. Body lice live and lay eggs on
clothing and only move to the skin to feed.

Body lice are known to spread disease.

Body lice infestations (pediculosis) are spread most commonly by close person-
to-person contact but are generally limited to persons who live under
conditions of crowding and poor hygiene (for example, the homeless, refugees,
etc.). Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the transmission of
human lice.

Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only
treatment needed for body lice infestations.
