_Zika virus information for blood collection establishments and tissue
recovery organizations_

CDC is working with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); state, territorial,
and local health departments; and blood collection establishments and tissue
recovery organizations to help ensure the safety of our blood and tissue
supply and reduce the risk of Zika virus transmission through blood
transfusion and tissue transplants. Zika virus disease is a nationally
notifiable condition. Domestic cases are reported to CDC by state,
territorial, and local health departments using standard case definitions.

## Areas at increased risk for Zika virus transmission through blood or tissue
donation in U.S. states

To protect the blood and tissue supply, CDC, in collaboration with FDA, has a
process to define areas at increased risk for Zika virus transmission through
blood or tissue donation.   For the purposes of blood and tissue safety
interventions, areas at increased risk for Zika virus transmission will be
identified at the county level in U.S. states. Defined areas of risk can be
different from areas for which CDC has issued travel guidance.

Updated as of February 28, 2019:

There are currently no areas at increased risk of Zika virus transmission
through blood or tissue donation in the U.S. states.

## Areas with risk of Zika outside of U.S. states

Based on laboratory analyses and mathematical modeling, a conservative yet
plausible estimate for introduction of Zika virus and substantive risk of
exposure in North America, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean
is January 1, 2014 ( _1,2,3_ ). Furthermore, scientific evidence confirms Zika
virus presence in some African and Asian countries for decades, in some cases
dating back to the 1950's ( _4,5,6_ ).

Please refer to the world map at this link for areas with risk of Zika outside
of the United States:
