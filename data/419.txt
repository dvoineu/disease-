## Summary

If you've ever gotten a splinter or had sand in your eye, you've had
experience with a foreign body. A foreign body is something that is stuck
inside you but isn't supposed to be there. You may inhale or swallow a foreign
body, or you may get one from an injury to almost any part of your body.
Foreign bodies are more common in small children, who sometimes stick things
in their mouths, ears, and noses.

Some foreign bodies, like a small splinter, do not cause serious harm. Inhaled
or swallowed foreign bodies may cause choking or bowel obstruction and may
require medical care.
