Illness anxiety disorder (IAD) is a preoccupation that physical symptoms are
signs of a serious illness, even when there is no medical evidence to support
the presence of an illness.

## Causes

People with IAD are overly focused on, and always thinking about, their
physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having or developing a
serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women.

The way people with IAD think about their physical symptoms can make them more
likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical
sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be hard to stop.

It is important to realize that people with IAD do not purposely create these
symptoms. They aren't able to control the symptoms.

People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have
IAD. But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse.

## Symptoms

People with IAD can't control their fears and worries. They often believe any
symptom or sensation is a sign of a serious illness.

They seek out reassurance from family, friends, or health care providers on a
regular basis. They feel better for a short time and then begin to worry about
the same symptoms or new symptoms.

Symptoms may shift and change, and are often vague. People with IAD often
examine their own body.

Some may realize that their fear is unreasonable or unfounded.

IAD is different from somatic symptom disorder. With somatic symptom disorder,
the person has physical pain or other symptoms, but the medical cause isn't
found.

## Exams and Tests

The provider will perform a physical exam. Tests may be ordered to look for
illness. A mental health evaluation may be done to look for other related
disorders.

## Treatment

It is important to have a supportive relationship with a provider. There
should be only one primary care provider. This helps avoid having too many
tests and procedures.

Finding a mental health provider who has experience treating this disorder
with talk therapy can be helpful. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a kind
of talk therapy, can help you deal with your symptoms. During therapy, you
will learn:

      * To recognize what seems to make the symptoms worse
      * To develop methods of coping with the symptoms
      * To keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms

Antidepressants can help reduce the worry and physical symptoms of this
disorder if talk therapy has not been effective or only partially effective.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The disorder is usually long-term (chronic), unless psychological factors or
mood and anxiety disorders are treated.

## Possible Complications

Complications of IAD may include:

      * Complications from invasive testing to look for the cause of symptoms
      * Dependence on pain relievers or sedatives
      * Depression and anxiety or panic disorder
      * Lost time from work due to frequent appointments with providers

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you or your child has symptoms of IAD.

## Alternative Names

Somatic symptom and related disorders; Hypochondriasis
