## Summary

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes pain, swelling,
and reduced motion in your joints. It can occur in any joint, but usually it
affects your hands, knees, hips or spine.

Osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage in your joints. Cartilage is the
slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage
absorbs the shock of movement. When you lose cartilage, your bones rub
together. Over time, this rubbing can permanently damage the joint.

Risk factors for osteoarthritis include

  * Being overweight
  * Getting older
  * Injuring a joint 

There is no specific test for osteoarthritis. Most doctors use several
methods, including medical history, a physical exam, x-rays, or lab tests.

Treatments include exercise, medicines, and sometimes surgery.
