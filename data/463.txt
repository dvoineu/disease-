## Summary

Sports can be a great way to get in shape or stay that way. Having a specific
goal can be a great motivator. Physically, you need strength and endurance.
Your training will vary with your sport. You would not train the same way for
pole vaulting as for swimming. You might, however, cross train. Cross training
simply means that you include a variety of fitness activities in your program.
Research shows that cross training builds stronger bones.

Remember to listen to your body. If you frequently feel exhausted or you are
in pain, you may be overdoing it. Injuries can be the result. And be sure that
you use your body and your equipment safely. What you eat and drink is also
important. Water is the most important nutrient for active people. Drink it
before, during and after workouts.
