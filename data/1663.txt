Weight-Less.jpg)

Once you start looking, you can find ways to cut calories for your meals,
snacks, and even beverages. Here are some examples to get you started.  
**Eat More, Weigh Less?**  
Eating fewer calories doesn't necessarily mean eating less food. To be able to
cut calories without eating less and feeling hungry, you need to replace some
higher calorie foods with foods that are lower in calories _and_    fill you
up. In general, these foods contain a lot of water and are high in fiber.

**Rethink Your Drink**  
Most people try to reduce their calorie intake by focusing on food, but
another way to cut calories may be to change what you drink. You may find that
you're consuming quite a few calories just in the beverages you have each day.
Find out how you can make better drink choices to reduce your calorie intake.

**How to Avoid Portion Size Pitfalls to Help Manage Your Weight**

![Walk with a friend](/healthyweight/images/healthy-eating/walkwithfriend-
small.jpg)

You may find that your portion sizes are leading you to eat more calories than
you realize. Research shows that people unintentionally consume more calories
when faced with larger portions. This can mean excessive calorie intake,
especially when eating high-calorie foods.

**How to Use Fruits and Vegetables to Help Manage Your Weight**  
Learn about fruits and vegetables and their role in your weight management
plan. Tips to cut calories by substituting fruits and vegetables are included
with meal-by-meal examples. You will also find snack ideas that are 100
calories or less. With these helpful tips, you will soon be on your way to
adding more fruits and vegetables into your healthy eating plan.

### Ideas for Every Meal1

Ideas for Every Meal Breakfast | Substitution | Calories Reduced by  
---|---|---  
Top your cereal with low fat or fat-free milk instead of 2% or whole milk. | 1
cup of fat-free milk instead of 1 cup of whole milk | 63  
Use a non-stick pan and cooking spray (rather than butter) to scramble or fry
eggs | 1 spray of cooking spray instead of 1 pat of butter | 34  
Choose reduced-calorie margarine spread for toast rather than butter or stick
margarine. | 2 pats of reduced calorie margarine instead of 2 pats of butter |
36  
Lunch | Substitution | Calories Reduced by  
Add more vegetables such as cucumbers, lettuce, tomato, and onions to a
sandwich instead of extra meat or cheese. | 2 slices of tomatoes, ¼ cup of
sliced cucumbers, and 2 slices of onions instead of an extra slice (3/4 ounce)
of cheese and 2 slices (1 ounce) of ham | 154  
Accompany a sandwich with salad or fruit instead of chips or French fries. | ½
cup diced raw pineapple instead of 1 ounce bag of potato chips | 118  
Choose vegetable-based broth soups rather than cream- or meat-based soups. | 1
cup of vegetable soup instead of 1 cup cream of chicken soup | 45  
When eating a salad, dip your fork into dressing instead of pouring lots of
dressing on the salad. | ½ TBSP of regular ranch salad dressing instead of 2
TBSP of regular ranch dressing | 109  
When eating out, substitute a broth-based soup or a green lettuce salad for
French fries or chips as a side dish | A side salad with a packet of low-fat
vinaigrette dressing instead of a medium order of French fries | 270  
Dinner | Substitution | Calories Reduced by  
Have steamed or grilled vegetables rather than those sauteed in butter or oil.
Try lemon juice and herbs to flavor the vegetables. You can also saute with
non-stick cooking spray. | ½ cup steamed broccoli instead of ½ cup broccoli
sauteed in 1/2 TBSP of vegetable oil. | 62  
Modify recipes to reduce the amount of fat and calories. For example, when
making lasagna, use part-skim ricotta cheese instead of whole-milk ricotta
cheese. Substitute shredded vegetables, such as carrots, zucchini, and spinach
for some of the ground meat in lasagna. | 1 cup of part-skim ricotta cheese
instead of 1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese | 89  
When eating out, have a cocktail or dessert instead of both during the same
eating occasion. | Choosing one or the other saves you calories. A 12-ounce
beer has about 153 calories. A slice of apple pie (1/6 of a 8″ pie) has 277
calories. | 153 if you have the apple pie without the drink 277 if you have a
drink and no pie.  
When having pizza, choose vegetables as toppings and just a light sprinkling
of cheese instead of fatty meats. | One slice of a cheese pizza instead of one
slice of a meat and cheese pizza | 60  
Snacks | Substitution | Calories Reduced by  
Choose air-popped popcorn instead of oil-popped popcorn and dry-roasted
instead of oil-roasted nuts.

| 3 cups of air-popped popcorn instead of 3 cups of oil-popped popcorn | 73  
Avoid the vending machine by packing your own healthful snacks to bring to
work. For example, consider vegetable sticks, fresh fruit, low fat or nonfat
yogurt without added sugars, or a small handful of dry-roasted nuts. | An
eight-ounce container of no sugar added nonfat yogurt instead of a package of
6 peanut butter crackers | 82  
Choose sparkling water instead of sweetened drinks or alcoholic beverages. | A
bottle of carbonated water instead of a 12-ounce can of soda with sugar | 136  
Instead of cookies or other sweet snacks, have some fruit for a snack. | One
large orange instead of 3 chocolate sandwich cookies | 54
