## Summary

Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a medically supervised program to help
people who have

    * A heart attack
    * Angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting for coronary heart disease
    * A heart valve repair or replacement
    * A heart transplant or a lung transplant
    * Angina
    * Heart failure

The goal is to help you return to an active life, and to reduce the risk of
further heart problems. A team of specialists will create a plan for you that
includes exercise training, education on heart healthy living, and counseling
to reduce stress. You will learn how to reduce your risk factors, such as high
blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, depression, and diabetes. Being
overweight, having obesity, smoking, and not exercising are other risk
factors.
