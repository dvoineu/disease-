#  Farm Health and Safety

## Summary

You might think of farms as peaceful settings. Actually, farming is one of the
most dangerous jobs in the United States. Farms have many health and safety
hazards, including

    * Chemicals and pesticides
    * Machinery, tools and equipment that can be dangerous
    * Hazardous areas, such as grain bins, silos and wells
    * Livestock that can spread diseases or cause injuries

Farming injuries are very common. Physical labor and accidents can cause
injuries.

Most farm accidents involve machinery. Proper machine inspection and
maintenance can help prevent accidents. Using safety gloves, goggles and other
protective equipment can also reduce accidents.
