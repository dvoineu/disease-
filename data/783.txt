# I Am CDC - Meet the Staff

Minus

Related Pages

CDC is one organization, but its success and stature as the most respected
government agency is thanks to the more than 50,000 people who have worked at
CDC since its beginning in 1946. It is the daily work of individual staff
members, physicians, epidemiologists, communication specialists, lab
scientists, accountants, lawyers, administration professionals, and countless
other disciplines that makes the agency hum with efficiency and productivity.
"I Am CDC" focuses on individuals across the agency whose day-to-day
dedication and hard work make CDC a better organization, making the point that
regardless of where they work or what they do, each person has a role however
small or large, in improving the public's health and protecting Americans from
health threats. These videos are also used for recruitment, hopefully spurring
interest in a career in public health, regardless of the professional field of
potential candidates.
