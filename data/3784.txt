Gastric tissue biopsy is the removal of stomach tissue for examination. A
culture is a laboratory test that examines the tissue sample for bacteria and
other organisms that can cause disease.

## How the Test is Performed

The tissue sample is removed during a procedure called upper endoscopy (or
EGD). It is done with a flexible tube with a small camera (flexible endoscope)
at the end. The scope is inserted down the throat into the stomach.

The health care provider sends the tissue sample to a laboratory where it is
examined for signs of cancer, certain infections, or other problems.

## How to Prepare for the Test

Follow instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. You will likely be
asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.

## How the Test will Feel

Your provider will tell you what to expect during the procedure.

## Why the Test is Performed

This test may be done to diagnose a stomach ulcer or the cause of other
stomach symptoms. These symptoms may include:

    * Loss of appetite or weight loss
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Pain in the upper part of the belly
    * Black stools
    * Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material 

A gastric tissue biopsy and culture can help detect:

    * Cancer
    * Infections, most commonly _Helicobacter pylori_ , the bacteria that can cause stomach ulcers 

## Normal Results

A gastric tissue biopsy is normal if it does not show cancer, other damage to
the lining of the stomach, or signs of organisms that cause infection.

A gastric tissue culture may be considered normal if it does not show certain
bacteria. Stomach acids normally prevent too much bacteria from growing.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to:

    * Stomach (gastric) cancer
    * Gastritis, when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen
    *  _Helicobacter pylori_ infection 

## Risks

Your provider can discuss the risks of the upper endoscopy procedure with you.

## Alternative Names

Culture - gastric tissue; Culture - stomach tissue; Biopsy - gastric tissue;
Biopsy - stomach tissue; Upper endoscopy - gastric tissue biopsy; EGD -
gastric tissue biopsy
