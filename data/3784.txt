Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can
occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. These effects
can range from mild to severe. They can affect each person in different ways
and can include physical problems and problems with behavior and learning. The
term FASDs is _not_ intended as a clinical diagnosis.

CDC worked with a group of experts and organizations to review the research
and develop guidelines for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) pdf
icon[510 KB, 62 Pages, Print Only]. The guidelines were developed for FAS
only. CDC and its partners are working to put together diagnostic criteria for
other FASDs, such as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder
(ARND)external icon. Clinical and scientific research on these conditions is
going on now.

### Guidelines for Diagnosing FAS

Deciding if a child has FAS takes several steps. There is no one test to
diagnose FAS, and many other disorders can have similar symptoms. Following is
an overview of the diagnostic guidelines for FAS. For more detail, see the
full text Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis pdf
icon[510 KB, 62 Pages, Print Only] for healthcare providers and other
clinicians.

These criteria have been simplified for a general audience. They are listed
here for information purposes and should be used only by trained health care
professionals to diagnose or treat FAS.

Healthcare professionals look for the following signs and symptoms when
diagnosing FAS:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1. **Abnormal facial features**

Children with FAS have height, weight, or both that are lower than normal (at
or below the 10th percentile). These growth issues might occur even before
birth. For some children with FAS, growth problems resolve themselves early in
life.

The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. It
controls all the workings of the body. When something goes wrong with a part
of the nervous system, a person can have trouble moving, speaking, or
learning. He or she can also have problems with memory, senses, or social
skills. There are three categories of central nervous system problems:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1.

differences are:

There are problems with the nervous system that cannot be linked to another
cause.  Examples include poor coordination, poor muscle control, and problems
with sucking as a baby.

Examples include specific learning disabilities (especially math), poor grades
in school, performance differences between verbal and nonverbal skills, and
slowed movements or reactions.

These deficits involve the thinking processes that help a person manage life
tasks. Such deficits include poor organization and planning, lack of
inhibition, difficulty grasping cause and effect, difficulty following
multistep directions, difficulty doing things in a new way or thinking of
things in a new way, poor judgment, and inability to apply knowledge to new
situations.

These delays affect how a person controls his or her muscles. Examples include
delay in walking (gross motor skills), difficulty writing or drawing (fine
motor skills), clumsiness, balance problems, tremors, difficulty coordinating
hands and fingers (dexterity), and poor sucking in babies.

A child with these problems might be described as "busy," overly active,
inattentive, easily distracted, or having difficulty calming down, completing
tasks, or moving from one activity to the next. Parents might report that
their child's attention changes from day to day (e.g., "on" and "off" days).

A child with social skills problems might lack a fear of strangers, be easily

Other problems can include sensitivity to taste or touch, difficulty reading
facial expression, and difficulty responding appropriately to common parenting
practices (e.g., not understanding cause-and-effect discipline)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * **Mother 's Alcohol Use during Pregnancy**  
Confirmed alcohol use during pregnancy can strengthen the case for FAS
diagnosis. Confirmed absence of alcohol exposure would rule out the FAS
diagnosis. It's helpful to know whether or not the person's mother drank
alcohol during pregnancy. But confirmed alcohol use during pregnancy is not
needed if the child meets the other criteria.

**Summary: Criteria for FAS Diagnosis**  
A diagnosis of FAS requires the presence of all three of the following
findings:

A person could meet the central nervous system criteria for FAS diagnosis if there is a problem with the brain structure, even if there are no signs of functional problems.
