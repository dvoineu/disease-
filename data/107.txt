## Summary

Part D is the name of Medicare's prescription drug coverage. It's insurance
that helps people pay for prescription drugs. It is available to everyone who
has Medicare. It provides protection if you pay high drug costs or have
unexpected prescription drug bills. It doesn't cover all costs. You have to
pay part of the cost of prescription drugs. Most people also have to pay an
additional monthly cost.

Private companies provide Medicare prescription drug coverage. You choose the
drug plan you like best. Whether or not you should sign up depends on how good
your current coverage is. You need to sign up as soon as you are eligible for
Medicare. Otherwise, there may be additional charges.
