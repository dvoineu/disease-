## Summary

Going home with a new baby is exciting, but it can be scary, too. Newborns
have many needs, like frequent feedings and diaper changes. Babies can have
health issues that are different from older children and adults, like diaper
rash and cradle cap.

Your baby will go through many changes during the first year of life. You may
feel uneasy at first. Ask your health care provider for help if you need it.
