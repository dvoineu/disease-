### Environmental Health

![map icon for Illinois](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/IL.jpg)

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community around you, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
affected negatively.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting public
health workers, educating communities, and providing scientific knowledge. We
help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a healthy
environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness caused by
environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might be
exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing healthcare costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

### Funded Activities

**National Asthma Control Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Illinois--$348,000. A new funding announcement has been
released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the year.)

Asthma

In 2008, an estimated 759,775, or 13.2% of adults, and 268,238, or 12% of
children in Illinois had asthma. The asthma hospitalization rate in adults was
156 per 100,000, and in children, it was 149 per 100,000 in Illinois.

Asthma is a common disease on the rise, with significant health disparities
and associated healthcare costs. Nearly 1 in 12 Americans (26 million) have
asthma. In the last decade, the proportion of people with asthma, grew by
nearly 15%.

CDC has been working with states for more than 10 years to implement
community-based interventions, build local coalitions, and track the impact of
the disease on the U.S. population.

The program focuses on what works to control asthma: assessing and measuring
changes in disease severity and control, using the right medications,
educating people to manage their conditions, and controlling environmental
irritants and allergens.

Even though the number of people with asthma has increased over the last 10
years, trends show that more are controlling their disease:

**Lead Poisoning Prevention Program**

(FY 2011 funding for Illinois--$594,000; because of funding reductions, the
program was discontinued in 2012. Some funding was restored in FY 2014. States
will be recompeting for funding and more information will be available later
in the year.)

More than 12 million U.S. children are exposed to lead in their homes at
levels that can harm their intellectual development. No safe blood level in
children has been identified.

Reducing children's lead exposure is perhaps the greatest environmental health
accomplishment in the past 20 years.

For more than 20 years, CDC funded state and local health agencies to

Children who are exposed to lead lose $3,000 to almost $8,000 in lifetime
productivity for each 1 microgram per deciliter (μg/dL) increase in blood lead
level. Blood lead levels over 1 μg/dL are associated with measurable
reductions in IQ.

Between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, interventions that control or eliminate lead
hazards before children are exposed (primary prevention) helped reduce the
number of children exposed to lead (blood lead levels ≥ 1μg/dL) by nearly 3
million, saving $26-57 billion in lifetime productivity earnings alone. These
estimates do not account for behavioral and other adverse effects on lifetime
productivity linked to lead.

### Public Health in Action

**Asthma Hospitalizations and Death Rates Reduced in Illinois**

During the past 20 years, Illinois has had one of the highest asthma death
rates in the nation, and the number of people living with asthma in the state
has increased. CDC's partnership with Illinois health departments helps people
control their asthma symptoms, stay out of the hospital, and lead healthier,
more productive lives. The Illinois Health Department's Asthma Program started
in 1999 with CDC funding. Since then, the rate of hospitalizations for asthma
has declined by almost 18%. In 2007, though the number of people living with
asthma continued to increase, asthma death rates hit their lowest levels ever.
The program also has realized many other successes such as developing a
statewide, 140-member asthma coalition structure; partnering with the Girl
Scout Association to help Girl Scouts earn an asthma badge; increasing use of
asthma action plans in schools; and providing educational asthma toolkits for
workplaces, child-care facilities, and coaches.

One mother's story helps illustrate the work of the program:

 _" Because of the Illinois Asthma Program, my son, age 4, now is getting
treatment for his asthma. Without education and networking of the Illinois
Asthma Partnership, my son's asthma might have gone untreated. He was seen by
his local healthcare provider and diagnosed with asthma and only placed on
rescue medication. After a period of time, he was not getting better. I
contacted the Illinois Asthma Program for assistance. He was seen by a
healthcare provider and a certified asthma educator at a family clinic. They
did appropriate testing, confirmed the diagnosis, wrote prescriptions, and
wrote us an asthma action plan for school and daycare. He continues to do
well. Without the awareness of the Asthma Partnership, a child would have
fallen through the gaps. I now work as the asthma coordinator for a local
asthma coalition."_

State legislation was enacted in 1993 that requires all children within the
state to be tested for blood lead levels before age 6. Before children enter
day care, preschool, or kindergarten, they are required to be assessed for
lead exposure. Illinois' Lead Program compiled and evaluated test results,
identified children requiring medical treatment, and referred children with
elevated blood levels to programs offering case management. In 2011, 13,035
Illinois children were identified with blood lead levels of 5 μg/dL or greater
and more than 1,900 children with blood lead levels of 10 mg/dL received case
management services. Local health departments and regional nurse consultants
followed up with children with elevated blood lead levels, conducting
education sessions on lead exposure prevention and presenting treatment
options.

Regional and local health department staff inspected 2,756 homes and common
play areas for lead hazards in 2010. Homes with lead-based paint and other
hazards require mitigation by lead abatement professionals. The Lead Program
licensed lead inspectors, lead risk assessors, abatement contractors, lead
supervisors, and lead workers and provided ongoing education to lead
professionals. In addition, the program approved lead training course
providers.

Illinois' Lead Program sent out quarterly newsletters highlighting program
activities, and operated a website that provided information about lead
prevention and updates to rules and regulations. The program also provided
educational materials to health care providers, parents, schools, day care
facilities, real estate agents, contractors, and the public.
