# Feeding patterns and diet - babies and infants

An age-appropriate diet:

      * Gives your child proper nutrition
      * Is right for your child's state of development
      * Can help prevent childhood obesity 

## Recommendations

During the first 6 months of life, your baby needs only breast milk or formula
for proper nutrition.

      * Your baby will digest breast milk more quickly than formula. So if you breastfeed, your newborn may need to nurse 8 to 12 times per day, or every 2 to 3 hours.
      * Be sure you empty your breasts regularly by feeding or using a breast pump. This will prevent them from becoming overly full and achy. It will also allow you to continue producing milk.
      * If you feed your baby formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 times per day, or every 2 to 4 hours. Start your newborn with 1 to 2 ounces ( 30 to 60 mL) at every feeding and gradually increase the feedings.
      * Feed your baby when they seem hungry. Signs include smacking lips, making suckling movements, and rooting (moving their head around to find your breast).
      * Do not wait until your baby cries to feed her. This means she is very hungry.
      * Your baby should not sleep more than 4 hours at night without feeding (4 to 5 hours if you are feeding formula). It is OK to wake them up to feed them.
      * If you are breastfeeding exclusively, ask your pediatrician if you need to give your baby supplemental vitamin D drops.

You can tell your baby is getting enough to eat if:

      * Your baby has several wet or dirty diapers for the first few days.
      * Once your milk comes in, your baby should have at least 6 wet diapers and 3 or more dirty diapers a day.
      * You can see milk leaking or dripping while nursing.
      * Your baby starts to gain weight; about 4 to 5 days after birth. 

If you are concerned your baby is not eating enough, talk with your
pediatrician.

You should also know:

      * Never give honey to your infant. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.
      * Do not give your baby cow's milk until age 1 year. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.
      * Do not feed your baby any solid food until 4 to 6 months old. Your baby will not be able to digest it and may choke.
      * Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier. 

There are several ways you can tell that your infant is ready to eat solid
foods:

      * Your baby's birth weight has doubled.
      * Your baby can control their head and neck movements.
      * Your baby can sit up with some support.
      * Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.
      * Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating. 

## When to Call the Doctor

Call the health care provider if you are concerned because your baby:

      * Is not eating enough
      * Is eating too much
      * Is gaining too much or too little weight
      * Has an allergic reaction to food
