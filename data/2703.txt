**TB Notes 5** **December 2016**

### Notes from the Director

Dear Colleague:

This fall has been a busy one for DTBE. The September release of the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation provides a new
opportunity for the TB community to draw attention to latent TB infection and
educate the public, health care providers, at-risk populations, and policy
makers on the importance of targeted testing and treatment for latent TB
infection.

DTBE staff were involved in several conferences in September and October,
including the September Tuberculosis Education and Training Network (TB ETN)
and the Tuberculosis Program Evaluation Network (TB PEN) Conference, the
International Union against TB and Lung Disease conferenceExternal in October,
and the TB Program Managers' Course in October.  In addition, we released the
2015 Annual Surveillance ReportCdc-pdf in November.

These activities, and the many others not mentioned here, continue to
demonstrate DTBE's commitment to fulfill its mission to promote health and
quality of life by preventing, controlling, and eventually eliminating
tuberculosis in the United States. As we enter the last month of the year, I
continue to be inspired by the great work you do every day.  I wish you all
safe and enjoyable holidays, and look forward to the great things we can
accomplish together in 2017.

Project Excellence award recognizes exceptional health education and training
products or activities that have been developed by TB ETN members within the
past 2 years. The 2016 TB Project Excellence Award goes to the "Child TB
Project."  This project was developed by the Bangladesh Pediatric Association;
the lead for the project was Dr. Shakil Ahmed.

Bangladesh is the 6th highest TB-burdened country in the world, and childhood
TB is considerably under reported. Over 10 months, the TBCARE II/USAID funded
projectExternal targeted health care providers in the Dhaka Division of
Bangladesh.

Using principles of adult learning and systematic health education, the Child
TB Project Team developed training modules and materials to improve skills in
screening, diagnosis, and management of child TB. The training consisted of
interactive sessions, assigned readings, role playing, group work, case
studies, and center visits. The Child TB Project Team led workshops for over
9,500 health care providers at three levels of service delivery including
clinicians, community health workers, and facility managers.

Congratulations to all of the 2016 award winners!

 **Education & Evaluation: Driving Toward TB Elimination**

The Tuberculosis Education and Training Network (TB ETN) and the Tuberculosis
Program Evaluation Network (TB PEN) Conference was held September 20-22, 2016
at the CDC Global Communications Center in Atlanta, Georgia.  The theme of the
2016 conference was Education and Evaluation: Driving Toward TB Elimination.
The TB ETN/PEN Conference emphasized the systematic health education process
and program evaluation planning and implementation. Conference activities
included skills-based workshops, informational presentations, and networking
opportunities.  The 240 participants included TB education & training and TB
program evaluation specialists from TB programs throughout the United States
and U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands, as well as federal and international TB
program staff.

The two-and-a-half-day conference included a variety of dynamic plenary and
breakout sessions aimed at skill building and information sharing.  The
opening plenary presentation was delivered by Dr. Phil LoBue, Director of the
Division of Tuberculosis Elimination at CDC.  Dr. LoBue discussed latent TB
infection (LTBI) surveillance and the newly released LTBI screening
recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  He emphasized
the importance of TB education and evaluation, and expressed his support for
strong TB education and evaluation activities in state and local TB programs.
Other conference highlights included sessions on how to educate policy makers
about TB, intermediate evaluation planning and implementation, LTBI
surveillance, tools for caring for TB patients who have diabetes, economic
evaluation, technology to enhance cohort review, and video/electronic directly
observed therapy practices.  Speakers included experts in TB education,
training, and evaluation at the local, state, national, and international
levels.  

The conference also hosted a scientific poster session with 34 abstracts
accepted for poster presentations.  Authors of four of the submitted abstracts
(two focused on TB education & training, and two focused on TB program
evaluation) were invited to give oral presentations.  The four abstracts that
were selected for oral presentations were:

**TB Program Managers ' Course 2016**

The overall purpose of the TB Program Managers' Course is to improve the
planning and managerial capabilities of new TB program managers throughout the
country. The course is designed for TB controllers, program managers, public
health advisors, and nurse consultants with programmatic responsibilities at
the state, big city, territory, or regional (within a state) level.  Course
participants should have occupied a TB program management position for at
least 6 months, but no more than 3 years, and are nominated by the DTBE
Program Consultant for their area.

The Communications, Education, and Behavioral Studies Branch (CEBSB) would
like to thank the faculty and participants of the 2016 TB Program Managers'
Course for making this year's course such a success. The hard work of the
faculty in preparing the materials for their sessions and the participants'
hard work during the course are greatly appreciated.

![](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_16/images/TB_ProgramManagers_Course.jpg)The
course was held October 24-27, 2016 at CDC's Global Communications Center.
The 4-day in-person training was divided into 19 sessions. The course stressed
practical application of planning, management, and evaluation concepts to the
specific issues and concerns of TB programs. Skills essential to TB program
management were presented, followed by exercises and polling questions that
encouraged participants to use knowledge learned.

For the participants, the course is not entirely over. They will be mailed a
6-month follow-up evaluation in April 2017. Once this evaluation is completed
and returned, each participant will receive a certificate of completion for
the course.

Laboratory Branch Updates

 **The Applied Research Team expands capacity for whole genome sequencing**

Since 2004, DTBE has conducted molecular surveillance of _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ (Mtb) nationally. Genotyping data are integrated with patient
demographic and clinical data, and routinely analyzed to identify suspected
outbreaks. The discriminatory power of conventional genotyping methods is
sometimes insufficient; some suspected outbreaks identified by genotyping
include a mix of outbreak and sporadic cases, or do not represent an outbreak
at all. Genomic surveillance has the power to increase the accuracy of
outbreak detection systems and to help stop the transmission of tuberculosis.

In collaboration with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Outbreak
Investigations Branch (SEOIB), the DTBE Laboratory Applied Research Team has
investigated and performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on approximately 80
different clusters of TB cases representing more than 1,000 isolates.  Once
completed and analyzed, the results and interpretation of the data are shared
with state and local TB programs; our experiences and feedback from these
programs demonstrate that WGS data result in a more focused use of limited
public health resources, leading to more effective epidemiologic field
investigations and an improved ability to identify where public health
intervention will have the greatest impact.

In 2016, the Applied Research Team led by Dr. James Posey was awarded a grant
from the CDC Office of Advanced Molecular Detection to expand the capacity for
WGS of Mtb.  In collaboration with the Association of Public Health
Laboratories (APHL), DTBE funded 5 state laboratories to provide WGS of
approximately 200 Mtb isolates per month.  The data and information generated
from this project will help us obtain the knowledge necessary to successfully
implement genomic surveillance of Mtb at the national level, build state
capacity to conduct WGS, and work with state and local partners to use these
results to guide field investigations and direct public health resources more
effectively than ever before.

The first increase in TB cases in the United States in 23 years underscores
the need for more comprehensive public health approaches in TB prevention and
control. Eliminating TB in the United States requires an expanded approach to
test and treat latent TB infection, and strengthen existing systems to stop TB
transmission.

**The Analytic Steering Committee (ASC) and how Data are used for Research**

Over the past 13 years, the Analytic Steering Committee (ASC) has invited
proposals from investigators interested in analyzing TB surveillance data, and
ensured the excellence and prompt publication of analyses of these data. These
publications are used by DTBE staff, state TB personnel, other CDC staff, and
the general public. They inform and educate the general public on research
done to prevent, control, and eventually eliminate TB.

Below is a brief summary of the ASC accomplishments, and information about the
proposal submission process for potential investigators.

![](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_16/images/ASC_AnalyticSteeringCommittee.png)

During its tenure, the ASC has received and reviewed 159 proposals.  Of these,
79 have resulted in publications.

The bar chart to the right shows the number of the ASC projects published
since 2003, and their principal investigator's affiliations (DTBE, other CDC,
and outside CDC).

Currently there are 15 projects in the analysis phase, 19 manuscripts in
progress, and 6 projects nearing the final stages of publication.

![](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_16/images/ASC_AnalyticSteeringCommittee2.png)

Another 4 projects are on hold at this time. Ten projects were placed on the
"Brilliant Ideas List" due to principal investigators' time constraints.
These ideas are available to other investigators.

There are a total of 22 projects that were either 'not published', 'not
approved by the ASC', 'withdrawn', 'not completed' or 'terminated.'

The bar chart to the left shows the current status of projects.  
Prior to 2003, there were 13 proposals grandfathered that existed prior to the

The Key Milestones of the ASC process are project proposal/analytic plan,
preliminary results and conclusions, and final manuscript.  To obtain project
approval, a proposal/analytic plan, including hypothesis generation and data
needs (e.g., RVCT data only, or Census data), must be submitted to the
Steering Committee.  Approval is granted or denied.  Following ASC approval
and before receiving access to these data, all investigators to be given
access to these data must have completed the web-based Assurance of
Confidentiality training within the past year; they must also renew it
annually, as long the investigators continue to have access to surveillance
data.

Following completion of the Assurance of Confidentiality training, the
Surveillance Team will provide access to surveillance data for analysis in a
manner consistent with the security and confidentiality practices in place at
the time that the data are made available.

For the final key milestone, a manuscript is submitted for clearance at the
NCHHSTP center level.  After manuscript is cleared, Principal Investigator
submits to journal for publication.
