#  Behcet's Syndrome

Also called: Behcet's disease

## Summary

Behcet's syndrome is a disease that involves vasculitis, which is inflammation
of the blood vessels. It causes problems in many parts of the body. The most
common symptoms are

  * Sores in the mouth
  * Sores on the sex organs 
  * Other skin sores 
  * Swelling of parts of the eye
  * Pain, swelling and stiffness of the joints 

More serious problems can include meningitis, blood clots, inflammation of the
digestive system and blindness.

Doctors aren't sure what causes Behcet's. It is rare in the United States, but
is common in the Middle East and Asia. It mainly affects people in their 20s
and 30s. Diagnosing Behcet's can take a long time, because symptoms may come
and go, and it may take months or even years to have all of the symptoms.
There is no cure. Treatment focuses on reducing pain and preventing serious
problems. Most people can control symptoms with treatment.
