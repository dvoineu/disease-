###  **Summary**

**What is already known about this topic?**

Binge drinking increases the risk for adverse health conditions and death.
Alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI), recommended by the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for all adults in primary care, is
effective in reducing binge drinking.

**What is added by this report?**

In 2017, 81% of survey respondents were asked by their health care provider
about alcohol consumption and 38% about binge drinking at a checkup in the
past 2 years. Among those asked about alcohol use and who reported current
binge drinking, 80% received no advice to reduce their drinking.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Implementation of alcohol SBI as recommended by USPSTF, coupled with
population-level evidence-based interventions, can reduce binge drinking among
U.S. adults.

Binge drinking* is a leading preventable public health problem. From 2006 to
2010, binge drinking contributed to approximately 49,000 annual deaths
resulting from acute conditions (e.g., injuries and violence) ( _1_ ). Binge
drinking also increases the risk for adverse health conditions, including some
chronic diseases (e.g., breast cancer) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (
_2_ ). In 2004, 2013, and again in 2018, for all U.S. adults aged ≥18 years in
primary care, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended
alcohol screening and brief intervention (alcohol SBI) or counseling for
persons whose screening indicated drinking in excess of recommended limits or
in ways that increase risk for poor health outcomes ( _3_ - _5_ ). However,
previous CDC surveillance data indicate that patients report rarely talking to
their provider about alcohol use,† and alcohol SBI is traditionally delivered
through conversation. CDC recently analyzed 2017 data from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey's five-question module, which asked
adults in 13 states§ and the District of Columbia (DC) about the delivery of
alcohol SBI during their most recent checkup in the past 2 years. Overall,
81.4% of adults (age-standardized estimate) reported being asked about alcohol
use by a health professional in person or on a form during a checkup in the
past 2 years, but only 37.8% reported being asked a question about binge-level
alcohol consumption, which is included on USPSTF recommended instruments ( _3_
). Among module respondents who were asked about alcohol use at a checkup in
the past 2 years and reported current binge drinking (past 30 days) at time of
survey, only 41.7% were advised about the harms of drinking too much at a
checkup in the past 2 years, and only 20.1% were advised to reduce or quit
drinking at a checkup in the past 2 years. These findings suggest that missed
opportunities remain for health care providers to intervene with patients who
report binge drinking. Working to implement alcohol SBI at a systems level,
including the provision of the new Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information
Set (HEDIS) measure, Unhealthy Alcohol Use Screening and Follow-Up, can
improve alcohol SBI's use and benefit in primary care.

BRFSS is an ongoing state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the
noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population aged ≥18 years in all 50 states,
DC, and participating U.S. territories. Information is collected on various
health conditions, health practices, and risk behaviors, including alcohol
use. CDC analyzed 2017 data from the 13 states and DC that administered an
optional alcohol SBI module. All BRFSS respondents are asked about the timing
of their last routine checkup. Those who had a checkup in the past 2 years
were asked alcohol SBI module questions.¶ All module respondents were asked
four questions: 1) "You told me earlier that your last routine checkup was
[within the past year/within the past 2 years]. At that checkup, were you
asked in person or on a form if you drink alcohol?"; 2) "Did the health care
provider ask you in person or on a form how much you drink?"; 3) "Did the
health care provider specifically ask whether you drank (5 for men/4 for
women) or more alcoholic drinks on an occasion?"; and 4) "Were you offered
advice about what level of drinking is harmful or risky for your health?"
Persons who responded affirmatively to any of the first three questions
(alcohol use screening-related) were also asked "Healthcare providers may also
advise patients to drink less for various reasons. At your last routine
checkup, were you advised to reduce or quit your drinking?" to assess brief
counseling. BRFSS assesses current binge drinking by report of drinking four
(women) or five (men) or more drinks on one or more occasions during the past
30 days.

Analyses were conducted to account for BRFSS's complex sampling design.
Weighted crude and age-standardized prevalence estimates of responses to
alcohol SBI module questions were calculated. Estimates were stratified by
demographic characteristics and selected drinking patterns. Subanalyses were
performed among alcohol SBI module respondents who indicated that they had
been asked at least one of three alcohol use screening-related questions in
the past 2 years and who reported current binge drinking (in the past 30 days)
at time of survey. Only age-standardized estimates are included in the text of
this report. Wald chi-squared tests were used to determine significant within-
group differences. SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) was used for
analyses. Only significant differences are reported. The median cooperation
rate** for the 14 sites was 71.7%, and median response rate was 43.8%.

Overall, 81.4% of module respondents indicated being asked by their health
care provider about alcohol use in person or by form, 71.8% reported being
asked how much they drink, and 37.8% reported being asked about binge drinking
(Table 1). The prevalence of module respondents being asked about binge
drinking was higher among males (40.1%) and persons with less than a high
school diploma (46.2%) than among females (36.0%) and persons with higher
levels of education (36.1% [college or technical school] to 37.1% [high school
diploma]). A higher percentage of persons with a household income <200% of the
federal poverty level were asked about binge drinking than were persons with
an income ≥200% of the federal poverty level. Hispanic adults reported being
asked about binge drinking more than other racial/ethnic groups. Prevalence of
being asked about binge drinking was also higher among module respondents who
reported binge drinking (47.3%) than among those who did not (36.1%).

Among module respondents who were asked at least one of the alcohol use
screening-related questions at a checkup in the past 2 years and reported
current binge drinking (past 30 days) at time of survey, only 41.7% were
advised about the harms of drinking too much at a checkup in the past 2 years,
and only 20.1% were advised to reduce or quit drinking at a checkup in the
past 2 years (Table 2). Among module respondents who were asked at least one
of the alcohol use screening-related questions and reported current binge
drinking in the past 30 days at time of survey, the prevalence of being
advised to reduce drinking at a checkup in the past 2 years was higher among
males (24.1%), persons with a disability (28.2%), persons with less than a
high school education (38.2%), persons with income <100% of the federal
poverty level (37.5%), and those without health insurance coverage (36.2%)
than among their counterparts. Prevalence was also higher among Hispanic
adults (28.5%) than among white adults (16.8%).

## Discussion

In 2017, although 81% of U.S. adults reported being asked by their health care
provider about alcohol use, only 38% reported being asked about binge drinking
during a checkup in the past 2 years, based on BRFSS data from 13 states and
DC. Fewer than half (42%) of module respondents who were asked about alcohol
use at a checkup in the past 2 years and reported current binge drinking (past
30 days) at time of survey were advised of harmful drinking levels; almost 80%
(four of five persons) received no advice to reduce their drinking (only 20%
were advised to reduce their drinking). Previous overall 2014 estimates, using
the BRFSS alcohol SBI module from 17 states and DC ( _6_ ), were similar to
overall 2017 findings, but not directly comparable because of differences in
states repeating the module in 2014 and 2017 (only five states implemented the
module both years). State-level trend analysis might occur in future reports.
An assessment of binge-level consumption is included on USPSTF-recommended
screening tools ( _5_ ).

Screening alone is not effective at reducing binge drinking ( _5_ ). Brief
counseling involves feedback based on screening results, a conversation about
the dangers of excessive drinking on the patient's health, and development of
a plan to reduce drinking if the patient chooses to do so ( _5_ , _7_ ).
Behavioral counseling is a necessary component of alcohol SBI for reduction in
consumption and adherence to drinking limits ( _5_ ). Persons with dependence
are to be referred to treatment, but referral might not occur, or patients
might not accept the referral, obtain treatment, or respond to treatment ( _5_
, _7_ ). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which
has long promoted SBI through grant programs, has a treatment locator†† to
assist with the referral process. A 2018 USPSTF review found that "Among
adults identified through screening, counseling interventions to reduce
unhealthy alcohol use were associated with reductions in alcohol use (by a
mean of 1.6 drinks/wk) and in the odds of exceeding recommended drinking
limits (by 40%) and heavy use episodes (by 33%) at 6 to 12 months of follow-
up….Among pregnant women, counseling interventions were associated with an
odds ratio of 2.26 for remaining abstinent from alcohol during pregnancy." (
_5_ ).

The demographic differences in this report might be a consequence of some
adults having more contact with health systems, such as those with a
disability ( _8_ ) or veterans, which could increase their likelihood of
receipt of alcohol SBI. In addition, screening practices might vary in health
care systems that have systematically implemented alcohol SBI (e.g., U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs and federally qualified health centers) ( _9_
).

Health system changes, such as the acceptance of a new 2018 HEDIS measure:
Unhealthy Alcohol Use Screening and Follow-Up,§§ might increase the provision
of alcohol SBI. Further, federal agencies have promoted broad implementation
of alcohol SBI, including CDC's funding initiatives to organizations working
on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,¶¶ the development of training and
implementation resources,*** and cross-agency, medical, and private sector
partnerships.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that if alcohol is
consumed, it should be in moderation (up to one drink a day for women, two for
men) and only by adults of legal drinking age.††† The 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans and the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism also indicate or advise that some persons should not drink alcohol
at all, including pregnant women ( _10_ ) or those who might be pregnant or
persons who have certain medical conditions or are taking medications that can
interact with alcohol ( _10_ ).

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First,
BRFSS data are self-reported, which can result in recall and social
desirability biases around the period of recall for the checkup. Second, data
in this report were from 14 sites, and thus, these results cannot be used to
estimate the prevalence of alcohol SBI across all states and territories.
Third, although respondents indicated current binge drinking in response to a
BRFSS survey question, whether they reported binge drinking to their health
care provider at time of checkup in the past 2 years is unknown; many
respondents reported not being asked about binge drinking at a checkup in the
past 2 years. Finally, the survey median response rate was only 43.8%, which
increases the possibility of response bias.

Binge drinking among U.S. adults continues to be a leading preventable cause
of considerable morbidity and mortality ( _1_ ). Alcohol SBI is an effective
clinical preventive service for reducing excess alcohol use,§§§ including
binge consumption ( _3_ , _5_ , _7_ ). This report suggests that alcohol SBI
is not being fully implemented as recommended. If alcohol SBI is implemented
as recommended by USPSTF ( _3_ , _5_ , _7_ ) and coupled with population-level
interventions recommended by the U.S. Community Preventive Services Task Force
for the prevention of excessive drinking (e.g., increasing alcohol taxes and
regulating alcohol outlet density¶¶¶), an opportunity exists to also reduce
alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Working to implement alcohol SBI at a
systems level, including the provision of the new HEDIS measure, Unhealthy
Alcohol Use Screening and Follow-Up, can improve alcohol SBI's use and benefit
in primary care.

* The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after four drinks for women and five drinks for men, in about 2 hours. https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/winter2004/Newsletter_Number3.pdfpdf iconexternal icon.

§§ The 2018 Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) measure,
Unhealthy Alcohol Use Screening and Follow-Up, was approved as a first-year
measure in June 2017 by the National Committee for Quality Assurance as a 2018
HEDIS measure. The testing and submission of this measure into HEDIS was
supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
The measure uses standardized tools for alcohol SBI and for those who screen
positive, the percentage who receive brief counseling or other follow-up
within 2 months of the positive screen is documented.

§ Persons in all racial groups were non-Hispanic. Persons who self-identified
as Hispanic might have been of any race.  
¶ Poverty categories are based on the ratio of the respondent's annual
household income to the appropriate simplified 2016 federal poverty threshold
(given family size: number of adults (1-14) in the household and number of
children in the household) defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. This ratio is
multiplied by 100 to be expressed as a percentage, and federal poverty
thresholds were then used to categorize respondents into four FPL categories:
1) <100% of FPL (poor), 2) ≥100%-<200% of FPL (near poor), 3) ≥200% of FPL
(not poor), and 4) unknown.  
** Respondents were asked "Are you deaf or do you have serious difficulty
hearing?" (hearing); "Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing,
even when wearing glasses?" (vision); "Because of a physical, mental, or
emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating,
remembering, or making decisions?" (cognition); "Do you have serious
difficulty walking or climbing stairs?" (mobility); "Do you have difficulty
dressing or bathing?" (self-care); and "Because of a physical, mental, or
emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as
visiting a doctor's office or shopping?" (independent living). Respondents
were identified as having one of the disability types if they answered "yes"
to the relevant question. Persons who responded "yes" to at least one
disability question were identified as having any disability. Persons who
responded "no" to all six questions were identified as having no disability.
Missing responses and respondents who answered "don't know" or who declined to
answer were excluded.  
†† Respondents who reported consuming four or more drinks on at least one
occasion during the preceding 30 days for women and five or more drinks for
men. An occasion is generally defined as 2-3 hours.
