# Top 10 Influenza Pandemic Response Planning Tips for H7N9 Virus

CDC is closely monitoring the avian influenza A (H7N9) situation in China and
is taking several preparedness measures. While no H7N9 cases have been
detected in the United States or anywhere outside of China at this time and
there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, CDC encourages
state and local public health agencies to use this time to review and
reinforce their pandemic preparedness plans in case the situation escalates.
CDC has developed these Top 10 Influenza Pandemic Response Planning Tips to
help senior public health officials at the state, local, tribal, and
territorial levels identify the most critical capabilities and activities
needed to assure jurisdictional readiness for an influenza pandemic response.

These suggestions are designed to help jurisdictions identify remaining
influenza pandemic preparedness operational gaps and improve readiness for
potential response. This is not an exhaustive list of all the steps necessary
for a sustained influenza pandemic response, but it is intended to give senior
public health officials a quick guide for accelerated planning. CDC recommends
jurisdictions review their respective H1N1 after-action reports and other
relevant data to better assess operational requirements.
