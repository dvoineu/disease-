## Summary

Snoring is the sound you make when your breathing is blocked while you are
asleep. The sound is caused by tissues at the top of your airway that strike
each other and vibrate. Snoring is common, especially among older people and
people who are overweight.

When severe, snoring can cause frequent awakenings at night and daytime
sleepiness. It can disrupt your bed partner's sleep. Snoring can also be a
sign of a serious sleep disorder called sleep apnea. You should see your
health care provider if you are often tired during the day, don't feel that
you sleep well, or wake up gasping.

To reduce snoring

    * Lose weight if you are overweight. It may help, but thin people can snore, too.
    * Cut down or avoid alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime
    * Don't sleep flat on your back
