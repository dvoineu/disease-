A stork bite is a common type of birthmark seen in a newborn. It is most often
temporary.

The medical term for a stork bite is nevus simplex. A stork bite is also
called a salmon patch.

## Causes

Stork bites occur in about one third of all newborns.

A stork bite is due to a stretching (dilation) of certain blood vessels. It
may become darker when the child cries or the temperature changes. It may fade
when pressure is put on it.

## Symptoms

A stork bite usually looks pink and flat. A baby may be born with a stork
bite. It may also appear in the first months of life. Stork bites may be found
on the forehead, eyelids, nose, upper lip, or back of the neck. Stork bites
are purely cosmetic and do not cause any symptoms.

## Exams and Tests

A health care provider can diagnose a stork bite simply by looking at it. No
tests are needed.

## Treatment

No treatment is needed. If a stork bite lasts longer than 3 years, it may be
removed with a laser to improve the person's appearance.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Most stork bites on the face go away completely in about 18 months. Stork
bites on the back of the neck usually do not go away.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

The provider should look at all birthmarks during a routine well-baby exam.

## Prevention

There is no known prevention.

## Alternative Names

Salmon patch; Nevus flammeus
