## Summary

Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your
windpipe and larynx (also called the voice box). The technical name for the
throat is pharynx.

You can have a sore throat for many reasons. Often, colds and flu cause sore
throats. Other causes can include:

    * Allergies
    * Mononucleosis
    * Smoking
    * Strep throat
    * Tonsillitis

Treatment depends on the cause. Sucking on lozenges, drinking lots of liquids,
and gargling may ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help,
but children should not take aspirin.
