## Summary

Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. If you're about to faint,
you'll feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous. Your field of vision may "white
out" or "black out." Your skin may be cold and clammy. You lose muscle control
at the same time, and may fall down.

Fainting usually happens when your blood pressure drops suddenly, causing a
decrease in blood flow to your brain. It is more common in older people. Some
causes of fainting include

    * Heat or dehydration 
    * Emotional distress 
    * Standing up too quickly 
    * Certain medicines 
    * Drop in blood sugar 
    * Heart problems 

When someone faints, make sure that the airway is clear and check for
breathing. The person should stay lying down for 10-15 minutes. Most people
recover completely. Fainting is usually nothing to worry about, but it can
sometimes be a sign of a serious problem. If you faint, it's important to see
your health care provider and find out why it happened.
