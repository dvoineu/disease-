#### Stories of Impact:

NIOSH has developed a series of products called Impact Sheets designed to
clearly and concisely communicate the relevance and impact of its research to
industry, labor, academic, government, and non-government stakeholders. Impact
Sheets briefly describe an occupational safety or health hazard, the specific
NIOSH or NIOSH-funded research activity that was conducted to address the
hazard, the resulting impact or recommendations, and certain salient
statistics. In addition, they serve as a communication tool to promote use and
adoption of the knowledge, interventions, best practices, and technologies
generated from the research. Several of the Impact Sheets feature award-
winning projects that have demonstrated impact on worker safety and health in
various industries including construction, healthcare, manufacturing, mining,
nanotechnology, and public safety, as well as featured projects from the first
and second decades of The National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA).
