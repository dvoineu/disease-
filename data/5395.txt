#### Q: What is MERS?

A: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness.
Learn about MERS.

#### Q: Why is it sometimes called MERS-CoV?

A: MERS-CoV is the acronym for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,
the virus that causes MERS. When referring to the virus and not the illness,
CDC uses "MERS-CoV." When referring to the illness, CDC uses "MERS." The virus
was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It is different from any other
coronavirus that researchers have found in people before.

Countries with Lab-Confirmed MERS Cases

 **Countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula that have reported MERS cases**
: Bahrain, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United
Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yemen.

**Countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula with travel-associated MERS
cases** : Algeria, Austria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Tunisia,
Turkey, United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (USA).

#### Q: What is the source of MERS-CoV?

A: MERS-CoV likely came from an animal source in the Arabian Peninsula.
Researchers have found MERS-CoV in camels from several countries. Studies have
shown that direct contact with camels is a risk factor for human infection
with MERS-CoV. But we need more information to understand the interactions
between humans and camels that are important for transmission.

#### Q: What are the symptoms and complications that MERS can cause?

A: Read about MERS symptoms and complications.

#### Q: How does the virus spread?

A: Learn about how MERS-CoV spreads.

#### Q: Has anyone in the United States gotten infected?

A: Yes, two patients in the U.S. tested positive for MERS-CoV infection, both
in May 2014. Get the most up-to-date information about MERS in the U.S.

####  Q: What is CDC doing about MERS?

A: CDC works 24/7 to protect people's health. It is CDC's job to be concerned
and move quickly whenever there is a potential public health problem. CDC
continues to closely monitor the MERS situation globally. CDC is working with
the World Health Organization and other partners to better understand the
virus, how it spreads, the source, and risks to the public's health. We
recognize the potential for MERS-CoV to spread further and cause more cases in
the United States and globally. In preparation for this, we have:

#### Q: Am I at risk for MERS-CoV infection in the United States?

A: The MERS situation in the U.S. represents a very low risk to the general
public in this country. Only two patients in the U.S. have tested positive for
MERS-CoV infection--both in May 2014 after recently traveling from Saudi
Arabia--while more than 1,300 have tested negative. CDC continues to closely
monitor the situation. Read to find out if you are at increased risk for MERS-
CoV infection.



#### Q: How can I help protect myself?

A: Visit the MERS prevention and treatment page to learn about how to protect
yourself from respiratory illnesses, like MERS.

Also see Interim Guidance for Preventing MERS-CoV from Spreading in Homes and
Communities. This guidance is intended for caregivers, household members, and
other close contacts of people confirmed to have, or being evaluated for,
MERS-CoV infection.



#### Q: What should I do if I had close contact with someone who has MERS?

A: If you have had close contact(1) with a confirmed MERS case within the last
14 days without using the recommended infection control precautions, you
should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation. See People Who May Be
at Increased Risk for MERS. Person-to-person spread of MERS-CoV, usually after
close and prolonged contact such as caring for or living with an infected
person, has been well documented.

It's important to note, however, that most people who had close contact with
someone who had MERS did not get infected or become ill.

#### Q: Can I still travel to the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries
where MERS cases have occurred?

A: Yes, there are currently no travel restrictions for the Arabian Peninsula.

#### Q: What if I recently traveled to the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring
countries and got sick?

A: If you develop a fever(3) and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as
cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after traveling from countries in
or near the Arabian Peninsula(2), you should call ahead to a healthcare
provider and mention your recent travel. See People Who May Be at Increased
Risk for MERS.

#### Q: What should I do if I had close contact with a recent traveler from
the Arabian Peninsula?

A: If you have had close contact(1) with someone within 14 days after they
traveled from a country in or near the Arabian Peninsula(2), and the traveler
has/had fever(3) and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or
shortness of breath, you should monitor your health for 14 days, starting from
the day you were last exposed to the ill person. If you develop fever(3) and
symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you
should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent contact
with the traveler. See People Who May Be at Increased Risk for MERS.

#### Q: Does the U.S. detain arriving travelers who they believe have MERS?

A: CDC may detain individuals arriving in the U.S. or traveling between states
who they believe are infected with a quarantinable disease, including MERS, as
of July 31, 2014, per amended U.S. Executive Order 13295external icon.
"Isolation" is used to separate ill people who have a contagious disease from
those who are healthy; "quarantine" is used to separate and restrict the
movement of well people who may have been exposed to a contagious disease to
see if they become ill. See About Quarantine and Isolation.

#### Q: Is there a vaccine?

A: Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against MERS.

#### Q: What are the treatments?

A: Learn about MERS treatment.

####  Q: Should I be tested for MERS?

A: If you develop a fever(3) and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as
cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after travel from a country in or
near the Arabian Peninsula(2), you should call ahead to a healthcare provider
and mention your recent travel or close contact. If you have had close
contact(1) with someone showing these symptoms who has recently traveled from
this area, you should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your
recent travel or close contact. Your healthcare provider will work with your
state's public health department to test you for MERS.

####  Q: How do you test a person for MERS?

A: There are two main ways to determine if a person is, or has been, infected

#### Q: What should healthcare providers and health departments do?

A: For recommendations and guidance on the case definitions; infection
control, including personal protective equipment guidance; home care and
isolation; case investigation; and specimen collection and shipment, see
Information for Healthcare Professionals.

#### Q: Is MERS-CoV the same as the SARS virus?

A: No. MERS-CoV is not the same coronavirus that caused severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, like the SARS virus, MERS-CoV is
most similar to coronaviruses found in bats. CDC is still learning about MERS.

Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC's Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. For detailed information regarding healthcare personnel (HCP) please review CDC Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring and Movement of Persons with Potential Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) Exposure. Transient interactions, such as walking by a person with MERS, are not thought to constitute an exposure; however, final determination should be made in consultation with public health authorities.
