## Summary

Shock happens when not enough blood and oxygen can get to your organs and
tissues. It causes very low blood pressure and may be life-threatening. It
often happens along with a serious injury.

There are several kinds of shock. Hypovolemic shock happens when you lose a
lot of blood or fluids. Causes include internal or external bleeding,
dehydration, burns, and severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. Septic shock is
caused by infections in the bloodstream. A severe allergic reaction can cause
anaphylactic shock. An insect bite or sting might cause it. Cardiogenic shock
happens when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This may happen after a
heart attack. Neurogenic shock is caused by damage to the nervous system.

Symptoms of shock include

    * Confusion or lack of alertness
    * Loss of consciousness
    * Sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat
    * Sweating
    * Pale skin
    * A weak pulse
    * Rapid breathing
    * Decreased or no urine output
    * Cool hands and feet

Shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and it is important to get help
right away. Treatment of shock depends on the cause.
