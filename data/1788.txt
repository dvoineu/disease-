Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated
animals in sub-Saharan Africa, such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and
camels. People can get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues
of infected animals, or through bites from infected mosquitoes. Spread from
person to person has not been documented.

Although RVF often causes severe illness in animals, most people with RVF have
either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and
dizziness. However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much
more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding),
and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).
