## Summary

Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight,
which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that a person's weight is
greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Children grow at
different rates, so it isn't always easy to know when a child has obesity or
is overweight. Ask your health care provider to check whether your child's
weight and height are in a healthy range.

If a weight-loss program is necessary, involve the whole family in healthy
habits so your child doesn't feel singled out. Encourage healthy eating by

  * Serving more fruits and vegetables
  * Buying fewer soft drinks and high-fat, high-calorie snack foods
  * Making sure your child eats breakfast every day
  * Eating fast food less often
  * Not using food as a reward

Physical activity is also very important. Kids need about 60 minutes each day.
It does not have to happen all at once. Several short periods of activity
during the day are just as good.
