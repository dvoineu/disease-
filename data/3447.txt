The VaxView websites provide vaccination coverage data for all ages.
Monitoring coverage for recommended vaccinations across the country helps CDC
assess how well local areas, states, and the nation are protected from
vaccine-preventable diseases.

What is Vaccination Coverage and Why is it Important?

Vaccination coverage is the estimated percentage of people who have received
specific vaccines. Health departments all over the United States monitor
vaccination coverage to understand how well communities are protected from
vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination coverage information is used to
identify areas and groups with lower vaccination coverage so public health
departments, health care partners, and schools can take action to help improve
vaccination coverage and protect everyone from vaccine-preventable diseases.

How does CDC track vaccination coverage?

CDC keeps track of the vaccination rates for the vaccines that are recommended
by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). This group of
medical and public health experts develops recommendations on the use of
vaccines to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) that occur in infants,
children, adolescents, and adults. CDC uses several surveys to measure the
vaccination rates for vaccines recommended for different groups, including:
