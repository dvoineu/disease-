# Smallpox Virus

Thousands of years ago, variola virus (smallpox virus) emerged and began
causing illness and deaths in human populations, with smallpox outbreaks
occurring from time to time. Thanks to the success of vaccination, the last
natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. In 1980,
the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated (eliminated), and no
cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since.

Smallpox research in the United States continues and focuses on the
development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests to protect people against
smallpox in the event that it is used as an agent of bioterrorism.
