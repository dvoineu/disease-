Preservation and storage of isolates

It is often necessary for an isolate to be re-examined or further
characterized at a time after the culture was initially obtained and tested.
If isolates need to be sent to a national reference laboratory for
confirmation of identity and/or further testing, they must be stored properly
prior to packing and shipping. Selection of a storage method depends on the
length of time the organisms are to be stored and the laboratory equipment and
facilities available. Isolates to be prepared for either short-term or long-
term storage should be confirmed as pure cultures before proceeding with any
of these methodologies. Fresh cultures (i.e., 18-24 hour growth) should always
be used for the preparation of isolates to be stored.

_N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae,_ and _H. influenzae_ are fragile bacteria
and care must be employed to preserve and transport them under the most ideal
conditions possible. Aseptic techniques should be used at all times during the
preparation of isolates for storage and/or transport to avoid contamination.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Short-term storage

_N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae,_ and _H. influenzae_ can only survive for
3-4 days on blood agar plates (BAP) and/or chocolate agar plates (CAP) and do
not survive for long periods of time in broth; hence the need for effective
and practical short-term and long-term term storage methods. Short-term
storage methods are appropriate for bacterial isolates that only need to be
stored for several days to a few weeks at a time. These methods include Dorset
Transport medium, chocolate agar slants, and silica gel packages.

Dorset Transport medium

Dorset Transport medium can be used for room temperature (25°C) storage of _N.
meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ (1). On Dorset Transport
medium, _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ can be stored for approximately
3 weeks, whereas _S. pneumoniae_ can be stored for approximately 6 weeks.
Instructions for preparation of Dorset Transport medium are included in the
Annex. Dorset Transport medium is typically produced as a 4 ml slant in a 7 ml
screw-cap tube. It should be stored at 4°C when not in use and warmed to room
temperature (25°C) before use.

Chocolate agar slants

If Dorset Transport medium is not readily prepared or used by the laboratory,
short-term storage of _N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H.
influenzae_ can be carried out on chocolate agar slants for up to 1 week.
Instructions for preparation of chocolate agar slants are included in the
Annex. Chocolate agar slants are typically produced as a 4 ml slant in a 7 ml
screw-cap tube. They should be stored at 4°C when not in use and warmed to
room temperature (25°C) before use.

Store the slant at room temperature (25°C). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * For _N. meningitidis_ , solid screw-caps should be loosened during storage but permeable membrane screw caps (which allow for an exchange of gases and are commercially available) should be used when possible. An overlay of trypticase soy broth (TSB) may also be helpful and might increase viability. _N. meningitidis_ slants should not be refrigerated.

Silica gel packages

_N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ can also be stored
short-term on swabs stored in silica gel packets, which are typically 1.5 g
foil bags, with 75% white gel and 25% blue gel (the blue gel is added to
detect moisture). Isolates can survive approximately 2 weeks at 4°C and
perhaps slightly shorter at room temperature (25°C). The packets are
inexpensive and easy to use (Figure 1), but are not often available from
commercial manufacturers. Silica gel packages can be stored at room
temperature (25°C) when not in use.

Long-term storage

Long-term storage of bacterial isolates is best accomplished by either
freezing or lyophilization (freeze-drying). Freezing is the most convenient
storage method for frequently recovered isolates as the cultures do not need
to thaw completely each time they are removed from frozen storage. Lyophilized
bacteria can be stored for long periods at 4°C or -20°C and can be transported
without refrigeration. However, the equipment required for this procedure is
expensive and not all laboratories have the ability to lyophilize isolates.
Reference laboratories choosing to lyophilize bacteria should always maintain
a frozen preparation in addition to larger quantities of lyophilized strains
as some lyophilized preparations may be nonviable upon reconstitution.
Bacterial cultures may be stored frozen or lyophilized in a variety of storage
media formulated for that purpose.

Frozen storage

Skim milk with glycerol, defibrinated sheep, horse, or rabbit blood, or
Greaves medium is used for freezing. Instructions for preparing these media
are listed in the Annex. Human blood should not be used due to safety issues
(e.g., HIV and hepatitis transmission) and the possible inhibition of growth
of isolates resulting from antibodies or residual antibiotics. Glass ampoules
or vials for freezing in liquid nitrogen should not be used because they can
explode upon removal from the freezer.

Lyophilization

Some laboratories may have lyophilization facilities. Serum-based media, skim
milk, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) medium are generally used for
lyophilization.

If no growth is observed on the plate, place 10 µl of the broth tube contents onto a new agar plate, streak for isolation, and incubate for 18-24 hours at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).

This is why it is strongly suggested that a specimen be prepared for long-term frozen storage in addition to lyophilization.

Preparation of infectious substances and diagnostic/patient specimens for packaging and shipping

Transport of diagnostic specimens and etiologic agents (infectious substances)
should be done with care not only to minimize the hazard to humans and the
environment, but also to protect the viability of the suspected pathogens.
Transport of infectious material by public or commercial delivery systems may
be subject to local, national, and international regulations.

If possible, specimens should be shipped so that they arrive in the receiving
laboratory during working hours to ensure proper handling, prompt plating, and
storage of the specimens. The receiving laboratory should be informed that the
specimens are being shipped, preferably before the specimens are sent, so that
appropriate arrangements can be made.

Depending on local conditions, within-country transport may be by ground or by
air. If specimens are sent by a messenger, the messenger must know the
location of the laboratory and the appropriate person to contact. The sender
should identify a quick, inexpensive, and reliable mode of transport in
advance and coordinate the shipping schedule and funding mechanism. For longer
distances and international shipments, the quickest transport service may be
air-freight or expedited delivery service. Because ice packs or dry ice for
cold shipments will last only 24-48 hours, arrangements should be made for
immediate collection at the receiving airport. In addition, the sender should
coordinate with a contact at the destination to identify any special
arrangements or criteria that need to be met for customs in that country. When
specimens are shipped by air, the following information should be communicated
immediately to the receiving laboratory: air freight company, air waybill
number, flight number, times and dates of departure and arrival of the flight,
and contents of the package.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Preparation for transport of infectious specimens and cultures

_N. meningitidis_ , _S. pneumoniae_ , and _H. influenzae_ specimens and
isolates can be shipped frozen or on chocolate agar slants, in silica gel
packages, or as lyophilized cultures. They should be packaged for transport as
indicated below.

Frozen specimens and isolates

Frozen specimens and isolates should be shipped using a sufficient amount of
ice packs or dry ice to maintain the proper cold temperature throughout the
duration of the transportation, especially when shipping long distances or
internationally. Ice packs will remain frozen for a day or two after the dry
ice has dissipated. Glass vials should not be used when shipping frozen
isolates. Guidelines for packaging infections substances and clinical
specimens are listed in Sections IV and V, respectively.

Chocolate agar slants

Chocolate agar slants in screw-cap tubes should be shipped at room temperature
(25°C). Isolates can survive for at least one week under these conditions.

Silica gel packages

Prepared silica gel packages should be shipped at 4°C (preferable) or at room
temperature (25°C). Isolates can survive for up to 2 weeks in silica gel
packages. Silica gel packages should be enclosed in 2 sealable bags within a
plastic shipping container.

Lyophilized cultures

Lyophilized culture vials should be packaged according to the regulations
specified in the WHO Laboratory Safety Manual, which is available at:
http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/WHO_CDS_CSR_LYO_2004_11/en/External.
Each vial or tube should be individually wrapped before being enclosed in a
metal container along with enough absorbent material to absorb all liquid in
the event of a spill. This container should then be enclosed in a cardboard

Regulatory organizations

The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods is
continually developing recommendations for the safe transport of dangerous
goods. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has used these
recommendations as the basis for developing regulations for the safe
transportation of dangerous goods by air. The regulations of the International
Air Transport Association (IATA) contain all the requirements of the ICAO
Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods. However,
IATA has included additional requirements that are more restrictive than those
of ICAO. Member airlines of the IATA have adopted the use of the IATA
regulations governing dangerous goods and shippers must comply with these
regulations in addition to any applicable regulations of the state of origin,
transit, or destination.

The shipment of infectious substances or diagnostic specimens by air must
comply with local, national, and international regulations. International air
transport regulations may be found in the IATA publication titled _Dangerous
Goods Regulations_. This reference is published annually in January and the
regulations are updated each year. A copy of the IATA regulations in English,
Spanish, French, or German may be obtained from one of the following regional
offices.

Shipping regulations for infectious substances and diagnostic/patient specimens

Packages that are shipped by air via commercial and cargo carriers (such as
Federal Express, DHL, and passenger aircraft) are affected by IATA
regulations. These regulations are outlined in this section of the laboratory
manual to provide examples of acceptable packaging procedures for infectious
materials. However, because they may not reflect current national or IATA
requirements for packaging and labeling for infectious substances, anyone
packaging isolates or infectious specimens should consult the appropriate
national regulations and the current edition of the IATA _Dangerous Goods
Regulations_ before packing and shipping infectious substances by any means of
transport (2). Table 1 includes images of labels and packages appropriate for
shipping and different classifications of packages under IATA regulations.
Note that a completed Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is
required for shipping hazardous materials including infectious substances.
Instructions for completing this form are provided at the end of this section.

Definition of infectious substances

According to IATA, infectious substances are defined as substances known or
reasonably expected to contain pathogens. Pathogens are microorganisms
(including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) and other agents
such as prions, which cause infectious disease in humans or animals.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. Definition of diagostic/patient specimens

According to IATA, diagnostic/patient specimens are those collected directly
from humans or animals, including, but not limited to, excreta, secreta, blood
and its components, tissue and tissue fluid swabs, and body parts being
transported for purposes such as research, diagnosis, investigational
activities, disease treatment and prevention.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. Guidelines for packaging and labeling infectious substances

Persons who ship infectious agents must comply with all local, national, and
international regulations pertaining to the packaging and handling of these
materials. They must ensure that specimens arrive at their destination in good
condition and that they present no hazard to humans or other organisms during
transport.

Guidelines for packaging and labeling diagnostic/patient specimens 

Diagnostic/patient (clinical) specimens with a low probability of containing
an infectious agent must be packaged as follows, so that will not leak after a
1.2 meter drop test procedure:

The primary receptacle or the secondary packaging must be capable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal pressure differential of 95 KiloPascals between -40°C and 55°C. Infectious substance containers exceed these criteria and are therefore acceptable for use for packing and shipping of diagnostic specimens.

If being shipped by air, the diagnostic specimens statement "Diagnostic specimen. UN 3373. Packed in compliance with IATA Packing Instruction 650" must be present on the air waybill as well as on the outer container. The packaging requirements for transport of diagnostic specimens are illustrated in Figure 3.

Dry ice must be placed outside the secondary packaging in an overpack and interior supports must be provided to secure the secondary packaging in the original position after the ice has dissipated.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Dry ice must be packed according to IATA Packing Instruction 954: the outer packaging must permit the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Cardboard and polystyrene foam are two examples of materials suitable for the packaging of dry ice. In a temperate climate, approximately 6 pounds of dry ice will dissipate in a 24 hour period and are therefore suitable for a 24 hour shipment. This amount should be adjusted accordingly for warmer climates and size of the box to ensure that the contents remain frozen. For air transport, the maximum dry ice allowed in a single outer container is 200 kg (approximately 440 pounds).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. Packages containing dry ice must be properly marked with the statement "Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice); UN1845; (and net weight of the dry ice in kg)," and a preprinted Class 9 "Miscellaneous Dangerous Goods" label, as shown in Table 1.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. When an overpack is used, it must be marked with the statement "Inner packages comply with prescribed specifications" because the UN Specification Markings will not be visible on the outer-most packaging.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  7. Guidelines for completion of the "Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods" form

All shipments of hazardous materials, including infectious substances, must be
accompanied by two original completed copies of the "Shipper's Declaration for
Dangerous Goods" form, along with the other shipping documents. It is
important to remember the following in order to reduce the risk of a shipment
being refused and returned to the laboratory of origin:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. International regulations require the diagonal hatch marks in the left and right margins to be printed in red. Therefore, black and white photocopies of this form may not be used.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. The form must be completed in English, although translations may accompany it on the same form.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. Specific terms, spellings, and nomenclature must be used. For example, a cardboard box must be referred to as "fibreboard box" (spelled with R before E), and there must be a comma after the term "infectious substance" within the statement "infectious substance, affecting humans".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. The person responsible for the shipment must be listed in one of the address boxes. If the person responsible for the shipment is different than the shipper or recipient, the responsible person's telephone number should be included alongside the name.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5.
