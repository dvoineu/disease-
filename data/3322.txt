Download Stand-alone FluLabSurge 1.0 Software Application Cdc-excel[12.1 MB]

FluLabSurge is a spreadsheet-based program designed to assist laboratory
directors forecast demand for specimen testing during the next influenza
pandemic (i.e., the surge in demand), and develop response plans.

###  Who Should Use FluLabSurge?

FluLabSurge is designed to assist laboratory directors and public health
officials. In the event of an Influenza Pandemic, both groups are responsible
for running influenza-testing laboratories.

###  What Does FluLabSurge Produce?

FluLabSurge produces estimates of: a) the daily number of specimens that may
be delivered to a laboratory for testing; and b) the testing capacity of that
laboratory (e.g., how many samples can be tested per day or work shift) per
pandemic transitional day found in each of the pandemic stages. FluLabSurge
also helps the user produce a one-page plan showing how capacity will be used
to meet user-defined testing goals (e.g., surveillance, strain identification,
clinical diagnostics).

###  What are the FluLabSurge 1.0 Model Components?

FluLabSurge is comprised of three different modules that must be used (i.e.
run) in order to produce meaningful results. FluLabSurge allows the user to
alter all of the model inputs and also allows the user to consider 1968-type
and 1918-type pandemic scenarios.

The three different modules are:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Workload Demand Module:** Predicts the DAILY number of specimens that may be delivered over the course of a pandemic. The number of specimens sent to a lab for testing will depend upon the total number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. A user can also choose a scenario representing a 1968-type pandemic or a 1918-type pandemic.

###  Help Features

On each page of FluLabSurge, you will find a "QuickStart Manual" button.
Clicking these buttons will provide pop-up windows containing an overview of
information that is presented on that page, such as definitions for inputs and
outputs, comments on what values need to be entered, and explanations on how
to interpret the results.

###  System Requirements

FluLabSurge uses the Windows* operating system (Microsoft Windows 2000 or
higher) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2000 or higher). We recommend using a
computer that has at least a processor with a minimum of 1GB of RAM (operating
memory), a 2.5 GHZ speed, and at least 15 MB of free storage memory on the
computer's hard drive.

We have successfully loaded and run FluLabSurge on a variety of desktop and
laptop computers using the Windows operating system. FluLabSurge is not
designed to run on Apple* or machines that use other operating systems such as
Linux.*

*Microsoft Windows and Office are copyrighted products produced by Microsoft Corporation, WA. The use of trade named products is for information purposes only. The U.S. Federal Government or its agencies do not endorse any specific computer or operating system.

###  Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that this is a test version of the software. The numbers
generated through the use of FluLabSurge should not be considered predictions
of what **will** actually occur during a pandemic. Rather, they should be
treated as estimates of what **could** happen.

###  Additional Information

Users are encouraged to use the "QuickStart Manual" buttons to obtain
additional information regarding the use and interpretation of results, as
well as comments on the general modeling philosophy used in designing
FluLabSurge. In addition to the resources listed in the References section,
