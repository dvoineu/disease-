## Summary

Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest
food, store energy, and remove poisons. Primary liver cancer starts in the
liver. Metastatic liver cancer starts somewhere else and spreads to your
liver.

Risk factors for primary liver cancer include

    * Having hepatitis B or C
    * Heavy alcohol use
    * Having cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver
    * Having hemochromatosis, an iron storage disease
    * Obesity and diabetes

Symptoms can include a lump or pain on the right side of your abdomen and
yellowing of the skin. However, you may not have symptoms until the cancer is
advanced. This makes it harder to treat. Doctors use tests that examine the
liver and the blood to diagnose liver cancer. Treatment options include
surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or liver transplantation.
