#  Diagnostic Imaging

Also called: Imaging

## Summary

Diagnostic imaging lets doctors look inside your body for clues about a
medical condition. A variety of machines and techniques can create pictures of
the structures and activities inside your body. The type of imaging your
doctor uses depends on your symptoms and the part of your body being examined.
They include

    * X-rays
    * CT scans
    * Nuclear medicine scans
    * MRI scans
    * Ultrasound

Many imaging tests are painless and easy. Some require you to stay still for a
long time inside a machine. This can be uncomfortable. Certain tests involve
exposure to a small amount of radiation.

For some imaging tests, doctors insert a tiny camera attached to a long, thin
tube into your body. This tool is called a scope. The doctor moves it through
a body passageway or opening to see inside a particular organ, such as your
heart, lungs, or colon. These procedures often require anesthesia.
