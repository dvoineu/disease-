Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects people of all ages,
including adult women. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) **found the percentage of privately-insured U.S. women aged
15-44 who filled a prescription for a medicine to treat ADHD increased nearly
350% between 2003 and 2015.** Options for managing ADHD symptoms during
pregnancy should be discussed with a healthcare provider as women consider
getting pregnant.

---|---  
**15 - 19** | **170%**

**25 - 29** | **700%**

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Some women may take ADHD medicine before they know they are pregnant, or may continue taking their ADHD medicine during pregnancy because it helps with their ADHD symptoms. Currently, there is very little information available about the safety of taking ADHD medicines during pregnancy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Women should discuss options for managing ADHD symptoms during pregnancy with their healthcare providers if or when they start planning for a pregnancy.

### Our Work

![Treating For Two. Safer Medication Use in
Pregnancy.](/pregnancy/meds/treatingfortwo/images/treating-for-two-
btn-300px.gif)

CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD)
is working to improve the health of women and babies through its Treating for
Two: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy initiative. Treating for Two works to
understand trends in medicine use among pregnant women and women of
reproductive age, and provide women and healthcare providers with information
about the safety or risk of using specific medicines during pregnancy. This
information will allow women and their doctors to make informed decisions
about treating health conditions during pregnancy.
