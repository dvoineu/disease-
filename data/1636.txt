A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that
**women with pre-existing diabetes** **are at an increased risk of having a
baby with a birth defect** , such as a defect of the brain, spine, or heart.
Women with pre-existing diabetes can increase their chances of having a
healthy baby by planning for pregnancy and working with a doctor to manage
their blood sugar before and during pregnancy.

### About Birth Defects

Birth defects are structural changes present at birth that can affect almost
any part of the body, such as the heart, brain, or foot. Birth defects are
common, costly, and critical conditions that affect 1 in 33 babies born in the
United States.

### Our Work

CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD)
strives to save babies through birth defects prevention and research. NCBDDD
uses birth defects tracking and research to identify causes of birth defects,
find opportunities to prevent them, and improve the health of those living
with birth defects. Learn how NCBDDD makes a difference.
