## Summary

During pregnancy, some common infections like the common cold or a skin
infection do not usually cause serious problems. But other infections can be
dangerous to you, your baby, or both. Some infections may lead to preterm
birth and low birth weight babies. Others can cause serious illness, birth
defects, and lifelong disabilities, such as hearing loss or learning problems.

Some of the infections that can be dangerous during pregnancy include

    * Bacterial vaginosis (BV)
    * Group B strep (GBS)
    * Hepatitis
    * Sexually transmitted diseases
    * Toxoplasmosis
    * Urinary tract infections
    * Yeast infections
    * Zika virus

To try to prevent infections,

    * Don't eat raw or undercooked meat
    * Don't share food or drinks with other people
    * Wash your hands frequently
    * Don't empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.

If you do get an infection during pregnancy, contact your health care provider
about how best to protect you and your baby. Only some medicines are safe
during pregnancy.
