## What is pharmacogenetic testing?

Pharmacogenetics, also called pharmacogenomics, is the study of how genes
affect the body's response to certain medicines. Genes are parts of DNA passed
down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your
unique traits, such as height and eye color. Your genes can also affect how
safe and effective a particular drug could be for you.

Genes can be the reason the same medicine at the same dose will affect people
in very different ways. Genes may also be the reason some people have bad side
effects to a medicine, while others have none.

Pharmacogenetic testing looks at specific genes to help figure out the types
of medicines and dosages that may be right for you.

Other names: pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenomic testing

## What is it used for?

Pharmacogenetic testing may be used to:

    * Find out whether a certain medicine could be effective for you
    * Find out what the best dosage might be for you
    * Predict whether you will have a serious side effect from a medicine

## Why do I need pharmacogenetic testing?

Your health care provider may order these tests before you start a certain
medicine, or if you are taking a medicine that is not working and/or causing
bad side effects.

Pharmacogenetic tests are only available for a limited number of medicines.
Below are some of the medicines and genes that can be tested. (Gene names are
usually given in letters and numbers.)

Medicine | Genes  
---|---  
Warfarin: a blood thinner | CYP2C9 and VKORC1  
Plavix, a blood thinner | CYP2C19  
Antidepressants, epilepsy medicines | CYP2D6, CYPD6 CYP2C9, CYP1A2, SLC6A4,
HTR2A/C  
Tamoxifen, a treatment for breast cancer | CYPD6  
Antipsychotics | DRD3, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A2  
Treatments for attention deficit disorder | D4D4  
Carbamazepine, a treatment for epilepsy | HLA-B*1502  
Abacavir, a treatment for HIV | HLA-B*5701  
Opioids | OPRM1  
Statins, medicines that treat high cholesterol | SLCO1B1  
Treatments for childhood leukemia and certain autoimmune disorders | TMPT  
  
  

## What happens during a pharmacogenetic test?

Testing is usually done on blood or saliva.

**For a blood test,** a health care professional will take a blood sample from
a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a
small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel
a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than
five minutes.

**For a saliva test,** ask your health care provider for instructions on how
to provide your sample.

## Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood test. If you are
getting a saliva test, you should not eat, drink, or smoke for 30 minutes
before the test.

## Are there any risks to the test?

There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or
bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away
quickly.

There is no risk to having a saliva test.

## What do the results mean?

If you were tested before starting a treatment, the test can show whether a
medicine will likely be effective and/or if you are at risk for serious side
effects. Some tests, such as the ones for certain drugs that treat epilepsy
and HIV, can show whether you are at risk for life-threatening side effects.
If so, your provider will try to find an alternate treatment.

Tests that happen before and while you're on treatment can help your health
care provider figure out the right dose.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, and understanding
results.

## Is there anything else I need to know about pharmacogenetic testing?

Pharmacogenetic testing is only used to find out a person's response to a
specific medicine. It is not the same thing as genetic testing. Most genetic
tests are used to help diagnose diseases or potential risk of disease,
identify a family relationship, or identify someone in a criminal
investigation.
