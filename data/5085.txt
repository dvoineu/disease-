Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_  (MRSA) can survive on some
surfaces, like towels, razors, furniture, and athletic equipment for hours,
days, or even weeks. It can spread to people who touch a contaminated surface,
and MRSA can cause infections if it gets into a cut, scrape, or open wound.

How can I keep my hands clean to prevent the spread of germs like MRSA?

Keeping your hands clean is one of the most important steps you can take to
avoid getting sick and spreading germs like MRSA. Use soap and water to clean
your hands if available. After wetting your hands and adding soap, scrub your
hands for at least 20 seconds. If you cannot access soap and water, use an
alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to clean
hands. Apply the sanitizer to one hand, rub your hands together, trying to
cover all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry.

They lift dirt and germs off surfaces so they can be rinsed away with water. Cleaning with a detergent is necessary to remove dirt that can prevent disinfectants from working. Some disinfectants have a cleaning agent mixed in, check the label to know which product you have.

Disinfectants effective against _Staphylococcus aureus_ , or staph, are also effective against MRSA. The disinfectant's label should have a list of germs that the product can kill, along with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration number. These products are also sold at grocery and other retail stores and may be helpful when someone has an infected wound.

What should I clean to prevent MRSA from spreading?

When cleaning and disinfecting, focus on surfaces that frequently contact
people's bare skin like desks, chairs, benches, gym equipment, lockers,
faucets, light switches and remote controls. In particular, clean any surfaces
that could come into contact with uncovered wounds, cuts, or boils. In
addition to cleaning surfaces, frequently cleaning hands and keeping wounds
covered keeps MRSA from spreading.

Large surfaces, such as floors and walls, have not been associated with the
spread of staph and MRSA. There is no evidence that spraying or fogging rooms
or surfaces with disinfectants will prevent MRSA infections more effectively
than the targeted approach of cleaning frequently touched surfaces and
surfaces that have been exposed to open wounds.

Which disinfectants should I use against MRSA?

Check the disinfectant product's label on the back of the container. Most, if
not all, disinfectant manufacturers will provide a list of germs on their
label that their product can destroy. Disinfectants effective against
_Staphylococcus aureus_ or staph are also effective against MRSA. These
products are readily available from grocery stores and other retail stores.

The EPA provides a list of EPA-registered products effective against
MRSAExternal (List H)

How should I clean laundry, equipment and difficult surfaces to stop MRSA from
spreading?

 ** _Laundry_  **

Routine laundry procedures, detergents, and laundry additives will all help to
make clothes, towels, and linens safe to wear or touch. If items have been
contaminated by infectious material, these may be laundered separately, but
this is not absolutely necessary. Dry laundry in a dryer, if available.

More about laundry on this website



_**Equipment**_

Shared equipment that comes into direct skin contact such as helmets and
protective gear should be cleaned after each use and allowed to dry. Equipment
should be cleaned according to the equipment manufacturers' instructions to
make sure the cleaner will not harm the item.

More about Cleaning & Disinfecting Athletic Facilities for MRSA on this
website



_**Keyboards and other Difficult Surfaces**_

Many items such as computer keyboards or handheld electronic devices may be
difficult to clean or disinfect because they could be damaged if they became
wet. If these items are touched by many people during the course of the day, a
cleanable cover/skin (e.g., keyboard skin) could be used on the item to allow
for cleaning while protecting the item. Always check to see if the
manufacturer has instructions for cleaning.

Is it clean?

Even when a surface appears visibly clean, it can still have germs. To protect
yourself from germs on shared surfaces you can:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Use barriers, like a towel or clothing, between your skin and the surface.
