### Abstract

Each year, 31 major known pathogens acquired in the United States caused an
estimated 9.4 million episodes of foodborne illness. Additional episodes of
illness were caused by unspecified agents, including known agents with
insufficient data to estimate agent-specific illness, known agents not yet
recognized as causing foodborne illness, substances known to be in food but of
unproven pathogenicity, and unknown agents. To estimate these additional
illnesses, we used data from surveys, hospital records, and death certificates
to estimate illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths from acute gastroenteritis
and subtracted illnesses caused by known gastroenteritis pathogens. If the
proportions acquired by domestic foodborne transmission were similar to those
for known gastroenteritis pathogens, then an estimated 38.4 million (90%
credible interval [CrI] 19.8â61.2 million) episodes of domestically acquired
foodborne illness were caused by unspecified agents, resulting in 71,878
hospitalizations (90% CrI 9,924â157,340) and 1,686 deaths (90% CrI
369â3,338).

Foodborne diseases are a major cause of illness and death in the United
States. In another article, we estimated that each year, major known pathogens
acquired in the United States caused 9.4 million episodes of foodborne
illness, resulting in 55,961 hospitalizations and 1,351 deaths ( _1_).
(Hereafter, episodes of illness are referred to as illnesses.) Although the
number of illnesses caused by these pathogens is substantial, these illnesses
represent only a subset of the total illnesses.

An additional proportion of foodborne illness is probably caused by a
heterogeneous group of less understood agents. First, many agents that cause
acute gastroenteritis are recognized as known or possible causes of foodborne
illness, but because of a paucity of data, the number of agent-specific
illnesses cannot be estimated. This category includes infectious agents (e.g.,
_Aeromonas_ spp., _Edwardsiella_ spp., and _Plesiomonas_ spp.) and
noninfectious agents (e.g., mushroom and marine biotoxins, metals, and other
inorganic toxins). Second, some known agents may not be recognized as being
transmitted in food. Detection of _Clostridium difficile_ in retail meat
products suggests that it may sometimes be transmitted by that route ( _2_),
and foodborne transmission of _Trypanosoma_ spp. has recently been recognized
in Brazil but not in the United States ( _3_). Third, microbes, chemicals, and
other substances known to be in food could at some time be shown to cause
acute illness. Fourth, agents of foodborne illness continue to be discovered.
Many major foodborne pathogens, e.g., _Campylobacter_ spp. and _Escherichia
coli_ O157, were recognized only in recent decades ( _4_ _,_ _5_). For some
outbreaks (e.g., Brainerd diarrhea), even when specimens are obtained quickly,
no causative agent can be identified ( _6_ _,_ _7_). Additional agents of
foodborne illness probably remain undescribed ( _8_). This article provides
estimates of foodborne gastroenteritis illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths
in the United States, other than those caused by the 31 major known pathogens
considered in our companion article ( _1_).

We defined unspecified agents as agents that cause acute gastroenteritis but
that were not included in our estimate of foodborne illness caused by 31 major
known pathogens ( _1_). They include known agents with insufficient data for
estimating agent-specific episodes of illness; known agents not yet recognized
as causing foodborne illness; microbes, chemicals, or other substances known
to be in food but for which pathogenicity is unproven; and agents not yet
described. To estimate the extent of foodborne illness caused by unspecified
agents, we estimated the number of acute gastroenteritis illnesses,
hospitalizations, and deaths and subtracted the estimated number of acute
gastroenteritis illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by 24 major
known pathogens that typically or often cause diarrhea or vomiting (Figure 1).
We refer to them as the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens, although for a
few, diarrhea or vomiting was not the main clinical sign. Estimates of illness
were not made for unspecified agents that do not typically result in acute
gastroenteritis.

We used data from the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens to estimate the
proportion of unspecified agents that were acquired in the United States
(hereafter referred to as domestically acquired) and transmitted in food. Most
of our data were from 2000 through 2007, and all estimates were based on the
US population in 2006 (299 million persons) ( _9_). To account for
uncertainty, we used probability distributions to describe a range of
plausible values for all model inputs. The modeling approach used and
parameters of these probability distributions are detailed in the Technical
Appendix. Our model outputs are in the form of probability distributions
summarized by a mean point estimate with 90% credible intervals (CrIs).

#####  Acute Gastroenteritis

We estimated the number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis by using combined
data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)
Population Surveys conducted in 2000-2001, 2002-2003, and 2006-2007 (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], unpub. data). These methods are
described in detail elsewhere ( _10_). In brief, FoodNet Population Surveys
are random-digit-dial telephone surveys of the general population in FoodNet
sites. At the time of these surveys, the population in FoodNet sites included
11% (in 2000) to 15% (in 2007) of the US population. In 2005, the demographic
features of this population were similar to those of the US population, but
the proportion of Hispanics was lower ( _11_).

Surveys were conducted over 12-month periods and collected information about
episodes of diarrhea and vomiting in the past month. Our estimate of the
annual number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis was derived by multiplying
the average monthly prevalence by 12. An episode of acute gastroenteritis was
defined as diarrhea (>3 loose stools in 24 hours) or vomiting in the past
month, each lasting >1 day or resulting in restricted daily activities. We
excluded persons with a chronic condition in which diarrhea or vomiting was a
major clinical sign and persons with concurrent cough or sore throat. Data
were weighted to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to
reflect the surveillance population by age and sex.

The estimated rates of acute gastroenteritis according to individual surveys
were 0.49 (2000-2001), 0.54 (2002-2003), and 0.73 (2006-2007) episodes per
person per year. The number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis was estimated
by applying the average rate (0.6 episodes/person/year) from the combined
surveys to the 2006 US population estimate. Uncertainty was added by assuming
that individual FoodNet site estimates were normally distributed with standard
deviations equal to survey standard errors (Technical Appendix).

#####  Hospitalizations

We estimated the number of hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis by using
2000-2006 national estimates from 3 sources: CDC National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) National Hospital Discharge System (NHDS) ( _12_ _,_ _13_);
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) (
_14_); and combined data from NCHS National Ambulatory and National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS and NHAMCS) ( _15_).

Codes from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM), were used to extract hospital discharge data from
NHDS and NIS when acute gastroenteritis was listed as 1 of the first 3
diagnoses. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes
001-008 (infectious gastroenteritis of known cause), 009 (infectious
gastroenteritis), 558.9 (other and unspecified noninfectious gastroenteritis
and colitis), or 787.9 (other symptoms involving digestive system: diarrhea),
excluding 008.45 ( _C. difficile_ colitis) and 005.1 (botulism). Many
infectious diseases from which a pathogen was not isolated may be coded as
other and unspecified noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis. Annual
national estimates from 2000-2006 NHDS and 2000-2006 NIS data were obtained by
weighting the sample data according to NCHS and the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project criteria ( _12_ _,_ _14_).

To estimate hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis from NAMCS and NHAMCS
data, we combined data from both surveys and extracted patient visits to
clinical settings (including physician offices, hospital emergency and
outpatient departments) with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis resulting in
hospitalization, when acute gastroenteritis was listed as 1 of the 3 codes.
Acute gastroenteritis was defined by using the ICD-9-CM codes described above.
Annual national estimates were obtained by weighting the sample data according
to NCHS criteria ( _15_).

During 2000-2006, mean annual rates of hospitalization for acute
gastroenteritis were 203 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons according to
NHDS data, 187 per 100,000 according to NIS data, and 109 per 100,000
according to NAMCS and NHAMCS data. To estimate the number of hospitalizations
for acute gastroenteritis, we chose the PERT distribution with a low, modal,
and high value determined by the lowest (90), mean (166), and highest (211)
annual rate per 100,000 persons across all 3 surveys and applied this
distribution to the 2006 US population (Technical Appendix).

#####  Deaths

We estimated the number of deaths caused by acute gastroenteritis by using
multiple cause-of-death data from the National Vital Statistics System
(2000-2006) ( _16_ _,_ _17_) when acute gastroenteritis was listed as the
underlying or a contributing cause. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as ICD,
10th Revision, codes A00.9-A08.5 (infectious gastroenteritis of known cause),
A09 (diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin), and K52.9
(noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified), excluding A04.7
(enterocolitis caused by _C. difficile_ ) and A05.1 (botulism). To estimate
the number of deaths, we chose the mean death rate (1.5 deaths/100,000
population) as the modal value of a PERT distribution, used the lowest and
highest annual death rates (1.2 and 2.4 deaths/100,000 population) as the
lower and upper bounds, and applied this distribution to the 2006 US
population.

To estimate acute gastroenteritis caused by unspecified agents, we subtracted
the estimated number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by the
24 known gastroenteritis pathogens from our estimate of the overall number of
illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths from acute gastroenteritis (Figure 2).
To estimate the number that were domestically acquired and transmitted by
food, we used the overall weighted distribution of the proportions of
illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths that were domestically acquired and
foodborne from the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens to describe the lower,
modal, and upper values of the PERT distribution and applied these separately
to the estimates of unspecified illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths
(Technical Appendix).

#####  Uncertainty Analysis

The parametric distribution used for almost all multipliers was a 4-parameter
beta (modified PERT) distribution ( _18_). The first 3 parameters are low,
modal, and high. The fourth parameter is related to the variability of the
distribution. We typically fixed this last parameter at 4, which yields the
simple PERT distribution ( _18_). However, when describing the proportions
domestically acquired and foodborne from the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens, we used a value of 2 to reflect greater uncertainty (Technical
Appendix). On the basis of 100,000 iterations, we obtained empirical
distributions of counts corresponding to Bayesian posterior distributions and
used these posterior distributions to generate a point estimate (posterior
mean) and upper and lower 5% limits for 90% CrIs. We used SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for these analyses.

###  Results

#####  Foodborne Illnesses

We estimate that 38.4 million (90% CrI 19.8-61.3 million) episodes of
domestically acquired foodborne gastroenteritis were caused by unspecified
agents (Figure 2) as follows. We estimated that 178.8 million acute
gastroenteritis illnesses occurred each year in the United States. Subtracting
37.0 million estimated illnesses caused by the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens leaves 141.8 million acute gastroenteritis illnesses caused by
unspecified agents. The proportion of these unspecified agents acquired
through domestic foodborne transmission is unknown; however, applying the
distribution of the proportion of illnesses from the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens that were domestically acquired (98%) and foodborne (25%) yields an
estimate of 38.4 million domestically acquired foodborne illnesses caused by
unspecified agents.

#####  Hospitalizations

We estimate that 473,832 hospitalizations resulted from acute gastroenteritis
each year in the United States (Figure 2). Subtracting the 215,799 estimated
hospitalizations caused by the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens leaves
258,033 hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis caused by unspecified
agents. The proportion of these unspecified agents that were acquired as a
result of domestic foodborne transmission is unknown; however, applying the
distributions of the proportion of hospitalizations among the 24 known
gastroenteritis pathogens that were domestically acquired (97%) and foodborne
(23%) yields an estimate of 71,878 hospitalizations (90% CrI 9,924-157,340)
caused by domestically acquired unspecified agents that were transmitted by
food.

#####  Deaths

We estimate that an estimated 5,072 persons died of acute gastroenteritis each
year in the United States (Figure 2). Subtracting the 1,498 deaths caused by
the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens leaves 3,574 acute gastroenteritis
deaths caused by unspecified agents. The proportion of these unspecified
agents acquired as a result of domestic foodborne transmission is unknown;
however, applying the distributions of the proportion of deaths among the 24
known gastroenteritis pathogens that were domestically acquired (95%) and
foodborne (50%) yields an estimate of 1,686 (90% CrI 369-3,338) deaths caused
by domestically acquired unspecified agents that were transmitted by food.

###  Discussion

Unspecified agents are major contributors to the total number of episodes of
acute gastroenteritis and foodborne diseases. If distribution of domestically
acquired and foodborne agents is similar to that of the 24 known
gastroenteritis pathogens ( _1_), then these agents cause 38.4 million
episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis each year in the United States,
resulting in 78,878 hospitalizations, and 1,686 deaths. Combining the
estimates for unspecified agents and major known pathogens provides an
estimate of the total effect of contaminated food consumed in the United
States: 47.8 million episodes of illness, 127,839 hospitalizations, and 3,037
deaths (Table).

Our estimate of foodborne illness caused by unspecified agents is lower than
that estimated by CDC in 1999 (38.4 million vs. 62 million, respectively) (
_19_). A major reason for this decrease is our lower estimate of episodes of
acute gastroenteritis, which probably resulted from changes in data sources
and methods rather than a real decline in the rate of illness. Our estimate is
derived from the 3 most recent FoodNet Population Surveys, which had a sample
size 5× greater than that in the 1996-1997 FoodNet survey used for the 1999
estimates. Additionally, the 1999 estimates relied on respiratory symptom and
vomiting data from US studies conducted before 1980 ( _20_ _,_ _21_). The
current and the 1999 estimates excluded persons reporting concurrent cough or
sore throat, but the proportion of respondents reporting these signs was
higher in the current than in the earlier surveys (38% vs. 25%), contributing
to a lower estimated prevalence of acute gastroenteritis (0.60 vs. 0.79
episodes/person/year). In addition, the current study excluded persons with
vomiting who had been ill for <1 day or whose illness did not result in
restricted daily activities, whereas the 1999 estimate included all persons
with vomiting. All these factors contributed to the current estimate of acute
gastroenteritis being 24% lower than the 1999 estimate.

The proportion of illnesses estimated to be foodborne was also a major driver
of the current lower estimate of illness caused by unspecified foodborne
agents. Because no data existed with which to directly estimate the
proportions of unspecified agents that were domestically acquired and
foodborne, distributions of these proportions were estimated to be similar to
those of the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens ( _1_). Because norovirus
accounts for 59% of illnesses caused by the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens, the foodborne proportion was driven largely by norovirus. The
proportion of foodborne norovirus used for the current estimate is 26%, a
marked decrease from 40% used for the 1999 estimates. Additionally, unlike the
1999 estimates, the current estimates exclude international travel-related
illnesses. As a result of these newer data and revised methods, the mean
proportion of unspecified agents that were estimated to be transmitted by food
was 25%, which is lower than 36% used for the 1999 estimate.

Estimating the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by unspecified
foodborne agents is challenging. For an illness caused by a pathogen to be
recorded, a physician must order the appropriate diagnostic tests and the
pathogen must be detected. Without identification of a pathogen, infections
producing signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis may be coded as nonspecific
signs or symptoms or as noninfectious illnesses ( _22_). Our overall estimates
of hospitalizations and deaths from acute gastroenteritis, derived from
national data sources, include codes for infectious and noninfectious
gastroenteritis. To avoid overestimating the number of hospitalizations, we
selected outpatient visits resulting in hospitalization and we selected
hospital discharge records on the basis of only the first 3 listed diagnoses.
This approach was a compromise between limiting the analysis to
hospitalizations for which acute gastroenteritis was listed as the primary
cause and including hospitalizations for which signs or symptoms of
gastroenteritis may have been a manifestation of another illness. This
approach has been taken in other studies ( _23_ _,_ _24_). For deaths, we
included all records in which acute gastroenteritis was listed as an
underlying or a contributing cause.

Our approach to estimating illness caused by unspecified agents has many
limitations. First, the accuracy of our estimate of the number of acute
episodes of gastroenteritis from the FoodNet Population Surveys has not been
validated. This estimate was based on responses to questions about diarrhea
and vomiting in the past month. These data provide a measure of prevalent
cases; however, we lack sufficient data on duration of illness, onset date,
and multiple episodes in the past month necessary to estimate incidence. An
analysis of the FoodNet Population Surveys reported a 2-day median duration of
acute gastroenteritis ( _10_), suggesting that the increase in the estimate of
illnesses based on incidence versus prevalence would probably be small and
would be included within the range of sampling variability and uncertainty
associated with our estimate of acute gastroenteritis. The accuracy of the
1-month recall period for acute gastroenteritis is also unknown. Some evidence
suggests that shorter recall periods (e.g., past week) may result in higher
reported prevalence ( _25_). Which recall period is more accurate is not
known. Our estimate of the number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis may be
too high. Although our survey attempted to eliminate other causes of illness
by asking about chronic diseases, some of the vomiting illnesses classified as
acute gastroenteritis, for example, could have been caused by medications,
alcohol withdrawal, or other causes, and some of the diarrheal illnesses could
be caused by medications or other causes. However, our criteria for acute
gastroenteritis were fairly strict, and foodborne illnesses probably occurred
in some persons who were excluded because they had concurrent cough or sore
throat or because their illness lasted for only 1 day. Second, we may have
underestimated the episodes of illness caused by the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens. When our method is used, any increase in the estimate for the major
known pathogens will result in a decrease in the estimate for unspecified
agents. Recent serologic data from European countries suggest that infection
with _Salmonella_ spp. is more common than estimated by other methods,
including ours; however, many of these infections may be asymptomatic ( _26_).
Finally, the proportion of illnesses transmitted by food for unspecified
agents is unknown and may differ from that for the 24 known gastroenteritis
pathogens. Studies estimating foodborne disease in England and Wales and in
Australia (which also attributed a large proportion of foodborne illness to
unspecified agents: 73% in Australia and 48% in England and Wales vs. 80% in
the United States) have estimated a similar proportion of acute
gastroenteritis episodes to be transmitted by food (32%, and 26%, respectively
vs. 25% in the United States) ( _27_ _,_ _28_). A study of illness caused by
known chemical agents, with estimates of the proportion that include acute
gastroenteritis and that are foodborne, could help improve these estimates.

Combining the estimate for unspecified agents with that for the 31 major known
pathogens to arrive at an estimate of overall foodborne illness has
limitations. The method used for unspecified agents began with an estimate of
acute gastroenteritis episodes, hospitalizations, and deaths and scaled down
to a number for domestically acquired foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations,
and deaths. Conversely, for most known pathogens, our estimate scaled counts
of laboratory-confirmed illnesses up to an estimated number of ill persons,
accounting for underreporting and underdiagnosis factors that contribute to an
illness not being reported to public health agencies. Combining different
approaches is not optimal because the methods themselves may affect the
estimates derived. Also, our estimates do not include unspecified foodborne
illnesses that do not typically cause signs of acute gastroenteritis. Most
foodborne outbreak-associated illnesses caused by chemical agents reported to
CDC during 2001-2006 ( _29_) were not due to agents characterized by acute
gastroenteritis and so would not be included in our estimates.

Although the number of episodes of foodborne disease caused by unspecified
agents is substantial, the claim that 80% of foodborne illnesses are
unspecified must be treated with caution. Illnesses caused by the 24 known
gastroenteritis pathogens were, in most instances, estimated by using models
that scaled counts of laboratory-confirmed illnesses up to an estimated number
of illnesses with aggregate multipliers to adjust for underreporting and
underdiagnosis factors that contribute to an illness not being reported to
public health agencies ( _1_). These multipliers are sensitive to the methods
and modeling approaches used, and different choices could have increased
estimates for the 24 known gastroenteritis pathogens, thus decreasing the
estimate of foodborne illness caused by unspecified agents. For example, we
took a conservative approach to estimating the underreporting multiplier for
pathogens for which illness counts were derived from outbreak data ( _1_); a
less conservative approach would have increased estimated illnesses for these
pathogens.

Future estimates might be improved by validating them by using other data on
acute gastroenteritis episodes, hospitalizations, and deaths, such as by
reviewing acute gastroenteritis coded as a secondary discharge diagnosis or
assessing the accuracy of acute gastroenteritis coding on death certificates.
The diagnostic gap might be narrowed by identifying additional agents linked
to foodborne transmission. Systematic laboratory investigation of specimens
from well-investigated outbreaks of foodborne disease of undetermined cause,
and detailed investigations of specific syndromes, may identify new agents (
_4_ _,_ _5_ _,_ _30_).
