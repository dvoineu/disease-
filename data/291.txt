## Summary

The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Many
conditions can affect your bladder. Some common ones are

  * Cystitis - inflammation of the bladder, often from an infection
  * Urinary incontinence \- loss of bladder control
  * Overactive bladder \- a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong time
  * Interstitial cystitis \- a chronic problem that causes bladder pain and frequent, urgent urination
  * Bladder cancer

Doctors diagnose bladder diseases using different tests. These include urine
tests, x-rays, and an examination of the bladder wall with a scope called a
cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include
medicines and, in severe cases, surgery.
