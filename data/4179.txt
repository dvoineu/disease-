**Prevent measles and talk to your doctor** about the measles, mumps, and
rubella (MMR) vaccine, especially especially if planning to travel.

## Prevent measles with MMR vaccine

Measles can be prevented with MMR vaccine. The vaccine protects against three
diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. MMR vaccine is given later than some
other childhood vaccines because antibodies transferred from the mother to the
baby can provide some protection from disease and make the MMR vaccine less
effective until about 1 year of age.

## Schedule for MMR vaccine if you're not traveling

Schedule for MMR vaccine if you're not traveling | First Dose | Second Dose  
---|---|---  
Children* | Age 12-15 months | Age 4-6 years  
Teenagers and adults with no evidence of immunity** | As soon as possible |
N/A  
  
* CDC recommends this schedule for children 12 months and older. **Infants younger than 12 months old and children traveling outside the U.S. shouldfollow another schedule.**

** Acceptable evidence of immunity against measles includes at least **one**
of the following: written documentation of adequate vaccination, laboratory
evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of measles, or birth in the
United States before 1957.

 **The vaccine schedule is different if you or your child are traveling
internationally.** You should follow this schedule instead.

If you have children, see if they're due for MMR vaccine:

## MMR vaccine is safe

MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97%
effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective.

#### Is there a link between the MMR shot and autism?

**No.** Scientists in the United States and other countries have carefully
studied the MMR shot. None has found a link between autism and the MMR shot.

## Measles can also be prevented with MMRV vaccine

Children may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps,
rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in
children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.

## Paying for the measles vaccine

Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. But you may want to
check with your health insurance provider before going to the doctor.

**Related page:** How to Pay for Vaccines

If you have a child and don't have insurance or if your insurance does not
cover vaccines for your child, the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) may be
able to help. This program helps families of eligible children who might not
otherwise have access to vaccines. To find out if your child is eligible,
visit the VFC website or ask your child's doctor. You can also contact your
state VFC coordinator.

## Measles is a serious disease that can lead to complications and death

Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through the
air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In fact, the measles virus can
stay in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person was there. So you
can get infected by simply being in a room where an infected person once was.
**It is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people
around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.**

Measles starts with fever. Soon after, it causes a cough, runny nose, and red
eyes. Then a rash of tiny, red spots breaks out. It starts at the head and
spreads to the rest of the body.

Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963:
