# Calorie count - sodas and energy drinks

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

It is easy to have a few servings of soda or energy drinks a day without
thinking about it. Like other sweetened drinks, the calories from these drinks
can add up quickly. Most provide little or no nutrients and contain large
amounts of added sugar. Soda and energy drinks can also have large amounts of
caffeine and other stimulants, so it is best to limit how much you drink.

Here is a list of some popular sodas and energy drinks, their serving sizes,
and the number of calories in each.
