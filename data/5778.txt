## **Safer food saves lives**

![Image for VitalSigns with the words: Multistate outbreaks cause 56% of
deaths in all reported foodborne outbreaks.](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/dpk-vs-food-safety.jpg)

The November Vital Signs focused on investigating and stopping multistate
foodborne outbreaks. From 2010 to 2014, multistate outbreaks caused 56% of
deaths in all reported foodborne outbreaks despite accounting for just 3% of
outbreaks. Foods involved in multistate outbreaks are contaminated before they
reach a restaurant or home kitchen. Investigating these outbreaks often
reveals problems on the farm, during processing or in distribution that
resulted in contaminated food. To help improve detection of and response to
these outbreaks, the report outlines specific actions such as the following:
food industries should keep detailed records to allow faster tracing of foods
from source to destination; state and local agencies should interview sick
people promptly about what they ate; healthcare providers should rapidly
submit specimens from sick people to public health laboratories for advanced
testing; and consumers should check for information about food recalls and
safe food handling and preparation.

Two recent _E. coli_ outbreaks traced to food from retailers are multistate
outbreaks. CDC, FDA, and several states have been investigating a multistate
outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O26 (STEC O26) infections linked
to eating at multiple locations of Chipotle Mexican Grill. As of December 4, a
total of 52 ill people have been reported from 9 states. Twenty have been
hospitalized, and there have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome or
deaths.

The outbreak was initially detected by public health officials in Washington
and Oregon through local foodborne disease surveillance. Officials in
Washington and Oregon detected an increase in STEC infections in their states
and after interviews with ill people they determined illness was likely linked
to eating at multiple Chipotle locations. Once DNA fingerprinting had been
completed, CDC determined that several illnesses in states other than
Washington and Oregon had occurred during the same period. Whole genome
sequencing also provided genetic information linking cases in multiple states.
The epidemiologic evidence available at this time suggests that a common meal
item or ingredient served at the restaurants is a likely source of the
outbreak; the ongoing investigation has not identified the specific food
linked to illness. Chipotle is assisting public health officials with
understanding the distribution of food items served at locations where ill
people ate.

Just before Thanksgiving, CDC, FDA, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS), and state and local health officials in several states collaborated to
investigate yet another multistate foodborne disease outbreak, this one
involving _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections in people who had eaten rotisserie
chicken salad purchased from Costco stores. As of December 8, a total of 19
people have been sickened in 7 states, and 5 have been hospitalized.
Preliminary laboratory results indicated the presence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in
a celery and onion diced blend used in the chicken salad and supplied by
Taylor Farms Pacific, Inc. As a result, the company voluntarily recalled
multiple products containing celery because they may be contaminated.
According to FDA, additional laboratory analysis of a sample of celery/onion
blend did not confirm the presence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in the sample, and the
investigation is working which specific ingredient in the chicken salad is
linked to illness. The celery and onion diced blend has not been ruled out as
a source of the outbreak. No additional illnesses linked to this outbreak have
been reported to CDC since November 23.

## **Dengue outbreak in Hawaii**

![Map of Hawaii with the words: Potential areas of infections by mosquito for

CDC is assisting the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) in the response to an
outbreak of dengueExternal on the Big Island. As of December 9, there have
been 145 confirmed cases of dengue.  Dengue is not endemic to the island, but
it is intermittently imported from disease-endemic areas by infected
travelers. This is the first outbreak of locally acquired dengue in the state
since 2011. CDC is providing diagnostic assistance to the Hawaii DOH in
confirming dengue cases. At the request of Hawaii's governor, CDC staff
traveled to Hawaii to assist with the investigation and outbreak response.

## **Ebola update**

#### _Status in West Africa_

![An african woman and doctor standing in a group of people. The woman has her
arms raised in celebrating](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/ebola-moving-
forward.jpg)

The situation in West Africa continues to evolve. On November 7, Sierra Leone
reached a major milestone in its fight against Ebola - after more than 14,000
reported cases and nearly 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the country free of Ebola
virus transmission. Additionally, as of December 7 Guinea had not reported a
confirmed case of Ebola since October 29. The last known patient with Ebola
tested negative on November 16, and the country's 42-day countdown to being
declared free of transmission began on November 17.

Despite the progress, it's clear that we cannot let our guard down. On
November 19, Liberia identified three new confirmed cases of Ebola. We also
know that Ebola virus sometimes persists in certain parts of the body after
someone recovers from the disease - and we continue to learn more about this
phenomenon. As we look toward 2016, we need to make sure each of these
countries is equipped to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to any new
cases. This means educating and supporting survivors, as well as maintaining
and strengthening the health infrastructure.

#### _New Ebola assays deployed_

Two new tests--the CDC Ebola virus NP real-time RT-PCR assay and CDC Ebola
virus VP40 real-time RT-PCR assay--have just been deployed to Ebola testing
laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network (LRN). The assays have been
authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Use
of these two assays in conjunction with the algorithm in the _LRN Guidance for
Definitive Identification of Ebola Virus in Patient Specimens_ will help speed
case confirmation and reduce the risk of false-positive results in vaccinated
individuals.

Foodborne outbreak tool just launched  
**

![ALT TAG - Image of blue background with the words: FOOD TOOL - Foodborne
Outbreak Online Database](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/food-tool.jpg)

The Foodborne Outbreak Online Database Tool (FOOD Tool) will make it easier to
search data on foodborne disease outbreaks. The tool includes interactive
features such as maps, graphs and tables. Users can search nearly 20 years of
outbreak data (1998-2014) by state, food, or pathogen. New features also allow
users to search data by specific foods and ingredients, view a "quick stats"
display, and get case counts for multistate outbreaks. Users can search
foodborne disease data by many factors, including year, state, location of
food preparation, food and ingredient, and cause of illness. Public health
investigators can use the database to help point them toward possible sources
of foodborne illness by searching foods implicated in past outbreaks. Because
the database contains information only on foodborne disease outbreaks reported
to CDC, guidance on using the data and limitations to keep in mind when
searching by food or ingredient is also provided.

CDC released a new publication that profiles fascinating new tests and tools
that have been developed to help us better protect people from ever-changing
infectious disease threats. _Innovative Technologies_ Cdc-pdf (also available
in print) looks at a wide range of innovations and improvements in diagnostics
(for dengue, yellow fever, and invasive candidiasis) and vaccines (rabies and
human papillomavirus). Also featured are improved ways of connecting
scientists with CDC's infectious disease expertise. For example, ePathology is
a new platform that connects NCEZID pathologists with scientists anywhere in
the world, and recent improvements to MicrobeNet make that system an easier-
to-access tool. _Innovative Technologies_ also showcases new solutions
designed to address large-scale problems like Ebola, antibiotic resistance,
and influenza. Among the novel technologies spotlighted are lab innovations
that were created to curb the Ebola epidemic, how NCEZID scientists are
providing the "raw material" to help pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic
manufacturers develop new antibiotics and tests to slow antibiotic resistance,
and a look at how video analysis could be used to more accurately describe how
flu spreads.

## **  
Ebola Update  
**

![Artist rendering of Ebola virus as long strands on a blue
background](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/ebola-rendering-blue.jpg)

We continue to learn more about Ebola, as evidenced by an October report
published in the ___New England Journal of Medicine_ External __ describing a
study done in collaboration between the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and
Sanitation, the World Health Organization, and CDC. In a preliminary study of
semen samples obtained from Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone, Ebola virus
fragments were detected up to 9 months following the onset of the illness. The
virus fragments were detected using a quantitative RT-PCR assay looking for
the sequences of two Ebola virus genes (NP and VP40). Semen samples from 93
Ebola survivors were analyzed, of which 46 (49%) samples were positive for the
Ebola virus RNA. Whether these viral fragments represent infectious virus able
to cause new infections is not yet known. The men were informed of their
results, provided condoms, and educated about how to protect their partners.
NCEZID researchers are now analyzing the samples to determine whether the
remaining virus is capable of causing new infections. These results highlight
the need for continued research as well as for education and support for the
survivors of Ebola and their communities.

Dietary supplements and emergency department visits  
**

![Image of colorful supplement pills with parts of pill bottles showing in the

Many people in the United States take dietary supplements, and until now we
have not had any national data on the adverse effects related to these
products. Thanks to a new CDC studyExternal published in the _New England
Journal of Medicine_ , we now know that about 23,000 emergency department
visits are attributed to adverse events related to dietary supplements each
year in this country. Among young adults, the most common reason for these
visits was for cardiovascular symptoms after they took weight-loss or energy
products. Among older adults, the most common reason for visits was swallowing
problems because of the size of pills. The study also received extensive media
coverage, including stories by ReutersExternal, UPIExternal, and the New York
TimesExternal.

Stopping the spread of antibiotic resistance  
**

![image with words Up to 70% fewer patients will get CRE over 5 years if
facilities coordinate to protect patients](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/antibiotic-resistance.jpg)

CDC's August Vital Signs shows that with effective action now, including
nationwide antibiotic stewardship efforts and interventions to prevent spread
of antibiotic-resistant infections, an estimated 619,000 resistant and
_Clostridium difficile_ infections, and 37,000 deaths among infected patients
might be averted nationally over the next 5 years. Antibiotic-resistant
bacteria can spread inside of and between health care facilities when patients
transfer from 1 health care facility to another for care without appropriate
infection control actions in place. The report outlines the importance of
facilities and health departments working together in a coordinated approach
to stop the spread of infections and slow antibiotic resistance.

NARMS Now: Human Data  
**

![Image showing data and the words Antibiotic resistance trends for 4
Foodborne Bacteria](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/narms.jpg)

NCEZID's new interactive tool, NARMS Now: Human Data, allows users to view
trends in antibiotic resistance over the past 18 years for 4 bacteria
transmitted commonly through food: _Campylobacter_ , _E. coli_ O157,
_Salmonella_ , and _Shigella_. Antibiotic-resistant infections from bacteria
transmitted commonly through food cause an estimated 440,000 illnesses in the
United States each year.  The tool, which contains antibiotic resistance data
from bacteria isolated from humans as part of the National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), allows you to search data by bacterial
serotype, antibiotic, year (1996-2013), and geographic region. The data can be
viewed on interactive maps and graphics or in tables. Use the data to see
resistance trends, geographic variances in resistance, and more.

Increased plague activity  
**

![infographic plague ecology in the us](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/plague.jpg)

NCEZID staff have been actively responding to an uptick in plague activity
throughout the western United States. As of August 31, there have been 12
cases (4 fatal), with 2 cases linked to exposures in or near Yosemite National
Park. The most recent case was confirmed by health authorities in Utah on
August 28. From 2001 to 2012, the annual number of plague cases in humans
ranged 1 to 17 (median = 3 cases). It's not clear why we're seeing a higher-
than-usual number of cases in 2015. For more information see the recent MMWR
article (published before the report of the Utah case).

Increased plague activity

![A woman sits with her arms around her young child](/ncezid/images/recent-

The outlook for controlling the Ebola epidemic continues to improve. As of
August 31, no new cases have been reported in Liberia following the cluster of
6 cases that occurred in July. The last 2 patients in Liberia were discharged
on July 23, and all contacts in the country have now completed their 21-day
monitoring period. It's also good to report that there have been no infections
in healthcare workers for 3 consecutive weeks in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or
Guinea. Although the outbreak has slowed dramatically from where we were a
year ago, there is still much to do. There are now thousands of Ebola
survivors - more than we've ever seen before - who will need medical,
psychological, and community support long after the epidemic has ended.

Ebola Update  
**

![Thumbnail image of the Road to Zero pdf](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/whats-new.jpg)

July 9 marked 1 year since CDC's emergency activation for Ebola. This is the
largest outbreak response in CDC's history - larger in scale and scope than
any other before. More than 1,200 responders, many of them from NCEZID, have
deployed to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and surrounding countries in West
Africa. To commemorate the first year of the response, CDC released a
multimedia reportCdc-pdf documenting the efforts of the agency and its
partners in fighting the outbreak, told through the stories and photos of our
responders. The website, video, and photobook offer a poignant look at how CDC
staff have contributed to this response over the past year. It's a terrific
multimedia summation of the year-long response.

Despite the progress that's been made, there is still much to be done. On June
29, Liberia reported a new confirmed case, its first since March 20, and five
more cases had been reported as of July 25. This shows us how difficult it is
for a country to stay at zero cases and underscores the need for continued
vigilance, meticulous contact tracing and other support for the affected
countries. Certainly the progress made over the past year in Liberia, Guinea,
and Sierra Leone, including establishing emergency operations centers,
improved laboratory capacity, and strengthened surveillance, aids in the
ongoing effort.

_Salmonella_ outbreaks in frozen stuffed chicken entrees  
**

![Image shows a plate with a plate with a stuffed chicken breast, green peas
and mashed potatoes](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/frozen-chicken.jpg)

Our colleagues in DFWED are also working with several states and USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service to investigate 2 separate outbreaks of
_Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections linked to raw, frozen, stuffed chicken
entrees, such as chicken Kiev and chicken cordon bleu. The 2 outbreaks are
caused by different strains of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis. As of July 29, the
outbreak linked to consuming frozen chicken entrees produced by Barber Foods
has involved 9 ill people in 4 states. The other outbreak, involving 3 ill
people in Minnesota, is linked to consuming frozen chicken entrees produced by
Aspen Foods. As a result of the two investigations, Barber Foods and Aspen
Foods each issued separate recalls of raw frozen chicken products totaling
almost 4 million pounds.

It's quite unusual for companies to recall raw poultry products for
_Salmonella_ that is not multidrug-resistant and that has not caused a large
outbreak. Contributing factors include the fact that the product looks cooked
but is actually raw; that the package labeling is already very clear in
warning consumers that the product is not cooked; that there is a history of
many previous outbreaks due to similar products; and that whole genome
sequencing (WGS) very closely linked the isolates from this product and the
ill people who ate it. This may be a first according to our DFWED experts.

This also is a look into the future of how _Salmonella_ outbreaks will be
investigated. Right now, only Minnesota and New York use WGS plus detailed
interviews to investigate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections.
Over the next few years, as WGS-based surveillance for _Salmonella_ expands to
other states--many of which interview case patients in detail--we can expect
to find many more clusters and outbreaks for _Salmonella_ , similar to what is
now happening for _Listeria_.

Rare infection in immunocompromised patients in Colorado  
**

![Image of a patient lying in bed asleep with a monitor in the

Three Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers from CDC went to Denver,
Colorado, to assist the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
with an investigation of mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients.
Mucormycosis is a rare, often fatal fungal infection, caused by a group of
angioinvasive molds. This investigation stems from the health department's
reports earlier this year about a cluster of mucormycosis infections among
bone marrow transplant patients in a Colorado hospital. The EIS officers are
searching for possible common sources of infections by conducting hypothesis
generation interviews and analyzing abstracted clinical data. If they identify
a strong hypothesis, they will assist in an analytical epidemiological study
to test the hypothesis. In addition, they aim to identify any breeches in
infection prevention measures.

What does antibiotic resistance look like? A CDC microbiologist holds two
Petri dish culture plates growing bacteria. In this case, the bacteria on the
left are susceptible to the antibiotics, meaning they cannot grow. On the
right, however, the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotics, meaning they
are able to grow next to almost all of the antibiotics tested.

Leaders from private industry and human and animal health organizations across
the country joined CDC and other federal agencies at the to discuss the
growing problem of antibiotic resistance . Organizations made specific
commitmentsExternal to combat the emergence of resistant bacteria, protect
antibiotics, and prevent a future where simple infections might kill because
we have no way to treat them.

CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden opened the forum by leading a discussion with
five of the committing companies--representing hospitals, nursing homes,
animal pharmaceuticals, and food producers and retailers--about the business
case for improving how we use and prescribe antibiotics. Attendees were then
split into two breakout sessions (human and animal health) to discuss
opportunities and barriers to implementing antibiotic stewardship principles
across US industry. The event was featured in a _Wall Street Journal_ op-
edExternal and generated 9-times more views of the CDC's Antibiotic Resistance
Solutions Initiative webpage (versus a typical day). And the media attention
around antibiotic resistance continues to grow, as witnessed by _Consumer
Report 's_ recent online report, "The Rise of SuperbugsExternal," the first of
a 3-part examination titled "America's Antibiotic Crisis." By the end of the
day-long forum, many health and business leaders had pledged to take immediate
action to turn the tide on antibiotic resistance.

CDC responds to MERS  
**

![Image of Health Advisory notice about MERS for those traveling from Middle
East or South Korea](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/mers-health-advisory.jpg)

Centers across CDC are working together in response to the outbreak of Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea, which reported its
first laboratory-confirmed case on May 20. As of June 25, a total of 180 cases
(including 29 deaths) have been confirmed in the Republic of Korea by the
World Health Organization, all linked to healthcare facilities where patients
with MERS were treated. One of these cases is a contact associated with the
outbreak who traveled to China while symptomatic. It's the largest known
outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula, where a Level 2 Alert,
Practice Enhanced Precautions has been in place since May 14.

CDC also posted a Level 1 Watch, Practice Usual Precautions for the Republic
of Korea on June 11, which includes a new infographic in KoreanCdc-pdf and
EnglishCdc-pdf with guidance for travelers to the country. Other activities
include posting a Hajj/Umrah travel notice before the 2015 Ramadan travel
season begins, displaying MERS messages for inbound travelers on electronic
message boards in arrival areas in international airports, and updating US
Customs and Border Protection materials to add information about the outbreak
in the Republic of Korea.

CDC's infection control experts contributed to the recently updated interim
infection control recommendations for hospitalized patients with MERS and
disseminated them widely through the MERS website, social media, extensive
partner distribution lists, a Health Alert Network (HAN) Advisory, and a
Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call with healthcare
providers around the nation. In addition to continued emphasis on standard,
contact, and airborne precautions, the guidance underscores other elements of
infection control programs that should be in place to prevent the spread of
infectious agents. Preventing virus transmission in hospitals with MERS
patients is a vital piece of the MERS response strategy.

How to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever  
**

![Image of young boy grinning with bright white teeth ](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/dental-staining.jpg)

CDC has been involved in raising awareness about how to safely and effectively
treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). A new studyExternal , conducted by
CDC and Indian Health Service, found that short courses of the antibiotic
doxycycline (the most effective antibiotic for treating suspected RMSF
infections) can be used in children without causing tooth staining or
weakening of tooth enamel. Countering misperceptions about the use of
doxycycline for children helps kids get lifesaving treatment, which is
especially important because children are 5 times as likely to die of RMSF
than any age group.

An accompanying _Journal of Pediatrics_ commentaryExternal, a Medscape expert
commentaryExternal and a new web page have been created to reinforce this
important public health message. Another studyExternal published in June in
The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene focused on the cost
savings that could result from prevention and early treatment of RMSF in
Arizona. The authors estimated that $13.2 million in losses was linked to the
epidemic of RMSF on two Indian reservations during 2002-2011.

The rabid dog's reportedly falsified vaccination documents.

On June 10, CDC's Poxvirus and Rabies Branch confirmed the diagnosis of rabies
in a dog imported from Cairo, Egypt. In total, 18 US citizens (Virginia
residents) have been started on rabies post-exposure prophylaxis due to
contact with the rabid dog. Human and animal exposure investigations have been
completed at the state level. A review is underway to determine how this
infected dog was able to enter the United States.

## **Ebola Update**

victory with the words: You've survived Ebola! What's
next?](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/survived-ebola-flipbook.jpg)Cdc-pdf

On May 9, CDC and its international partners celebrated a major achievement in
the Ebola response as Liberia's outbreak was officially declared over by the
World Health Organization. This date marked 42 days (two incubation periods)
since the last known Ebola patient in the country was buried. Public health
authorities in Liberia continue to maintain active surveillance so that any
new cases of Ebola are rapidly identified. This milestone followed CDC's
downgrading of Liberia's Travel Health Notice  from a Warning - Level 3 to an
Alert - Level 2 on May 4. US residents are no longer advised to avoid
nonessential travel to Liberia, but CDC still recommends they practice
enhanced precautions while there. We remain committed to helping Liberia stay
at zero cases, but we still have much work to do to get Guinea and Sierra
Leone to the same point.

As of May 24, there have been 27,013 total suspected, probable, and confirmed
cases of Ebola reported worldwide. Of those, 14,969 cases are confirmed, and
deaths from the disease now stand at 11,134. In Guinea, considerable
challenges still remain. In Sierra Leone, there are fewer cases, and those
that occur are coming from recognized chains of transmission. Our team is
meticulously tracing and appropriately isolating and following contacts of
these cases.

The Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was
successfully launched in April to assess the safety of the candidate Ebola
vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. As of May 24, over 4,350 participants have enrolled and
over 2,100 have been vaccinated.

## **Staying healthy and safe in the water**

![image of three children laying in a shallow area of a body of water and

With swimming pools about to open for the summer, CDC's Waterborne Diseases
Prevention Branch is hard at work educating the public about how to enjoy
swimming while decreasing the risk of getting sick with waterborne diseases.
An MMWR reportCdc-pdf on May 18 reported on a lake-based norovirus disease
outbreak last year that sickened 70 people, more than half of them children.
The authors found that people who swam were more than twice as likely to
become ill than those who went to the lake but did not swim. The report
coincided with Healthy and Safe Swimming Week (May 18-24), the theme of which
was "Make a Healthy Splash: Share the Fun, not the Germs." The Waterborne
branch developed a healthy swimming brochure and is promoting their healthy
swimming website and health promotion toolkit for health department partners

## **Annual Food Safety Progress Report**

![thumbnail image of the 2014 food safety progress
report](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/food-safety-report.jpg)

This year's annual food safety progress reportCdc-pdf showed that rates of
infection from _E. coli_ 0157 and _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (one of the more
common serotypes) decreased compared with the baseline period of 2006-2008\.
Meanwhile, some other less common types of _Salmonella_ increased,
Campylobacter and Vibrio rose again in 2014, and 6 other infections showed
little or no recent improvements. The yearly report measures foodborne
illnesses from 9 key pathogens and is produced from 2014 data compiled by the
Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet).

## **New rabies strain identified in New Mexico**

The New Mexico Department of Health asked DHCPP's Rabies Lab to assist in the
identification of rabiesExternal after a woman was bitten by a rabid fox in
Lincoln County, NM. Genetic sequencing of the virus done by CDC's Rabies Lab
showed that this was a rabies virus strain never before identified. The new
strain is related to other rabies strains found in bats. The woman received a
series of rabies vaccinations that protected her from rabies.

With cases continuing to be reported in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and a total
case count now surpassing 26,000, CDC's work on the Ebola response is still
far from over. Liberia's last known patient with Ebola died on March 27, and
we are now counting down to the day Liberia will be declared free of Ebola. We
continue to focus on improving the situation in Guinea and Sierra Leone, where
more needs to be done to identify and break all chains of transmission.

**_Laboratory diagnostics_**  
Work continues on the evaluation and roll-out of a rapid diagnostic test for
Ebola for use in country and on the long-term planning for transitioning to a
sustainable public health laboratory system.  

**_Vaccine trial starts in Sierra Leone_**  
CDC and its partners in Sierra Leone are working together on a candidate Ebola
vaccine trial , which officially launched in April 2015. The study, called the
Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine Against Ebola (STRIVE), will assess
the safety and efficacy of a candidate Ebola vaccine in about 6,000 health and
other frontline workers in five districts in Sierra Leone.

Listeria contamination results in voluntary recall of all Blue Bell products  
**

![Image shows a gallon container of Blue Bell ice

CDC, state and local health departments, and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration are investigating a complex multistate outbreak of listeriosis
linked to Blue Bell brand products. As of April 21, Blue Bell ice cream has
been linked to _Listeria_ illnesses in 10 people, 3 of whom died. The illness
onset dates ranged from 2010 through 2015, and a review of the PulseNet
database and whole genome sequencing data helped investigators link the
illnesses to Blue Bell ice cream.

On April 20, Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily recalledExternal all of its
products currently on the market, including ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet,
and frozen snacks, because they may be contaminated with _Listeria
monocytogenes_.   CDC recommends consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand
products and that institutions and retailers do not serve or sell them.

Multidrug-resistant shigellosis spreading in the US  
**

![Image of 3D image rod-shaped, drug-resistant Shigella

International travelers are bringing a multidrug-resistant intestinal illness
to the United States and spreading it to others who have not traveled,
according to an MMWR reportCdc-pdf released this month that received a lot of
media attention. _Shigella sonnei_ bacteria resistant to the antibiotic
ciprofloxacin sickened 243 people in 32 states and Puerto Rico between May
2014 and February 2015. Research by NCEZID found that the drug-resistant
illness was being repeatedly introduced as ill travelers returned and was then
infecting other people in a series of outbreaks around the country.  "The
increase in drug-resistant _Shigella_ makes it even more critical to prevent
shigellosis from spreading," said Anna Bowen, medical officer and lead author
of the study. "Washing your hands with soap and water is important for
everyone. Also, international travelers can protect themselves by choosing hot
foods and drinking only from sealed containers."

Ebola Update  
**

![Image of a young girl holds a poster about Ebola
protection](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/girl-ebola-poster.jpg)

In Liberia, a new patient tested positive for Ebola not long after the country
had started its countdown to being free of transmission. Teams are actively
engaged in tracing and following contacts. New cases continue to be reported
in Guinea and Sierra Leone, but considerable progress is being made in both
countries.

As long as there are cases in West Africa, Ebola remains a global threat. We
recently saw one American health worker evacuated to the United States for
treatment after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone, bringing the total number
of patients treated here for Ebola to 11. Several other potentially exposed
American citizens were also transported from Sierra Leone and will remain near
Ebola treatment centers throughout the country during their 21-day monitoring
period. We will not stop until we cases.

CDC is working with the Sierra Leone College of Medicine and Allied Health
Sciences and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation to launch a
candidate Ebola vaccine trial in Sierra Leone that is anticipated to start in
early April. The study, called the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine
against Ebola ( STRIVE ), plans to assess the safety and efficacy of a
candidate Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) among health and other frontline workers
in Sierra Leone.

Updated TB screening guidelines identify more cases overseas  
**

![3-D rendering of tuberculosis as long, red rods on a black
background](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/tb-screening.jpg)

A new study by DGMQ authors just published in the _Annals of Internal
Medicine_ (abstract: Effect of a Culture-Based Screening Algorithm on
Tuberculosis Incidence in Immigrants and Refugees Bound for the United States:
A Population-Based Cross-sectional Study External ) shows that because of new
TB screening guidelines issued in 2007, physicians overseas identified 629
additional cases of tuberculosis (TB) in 2012 among immigrants and refugees
bound for the United States. With implementation in all countries having been
completed, physicians overseas should continue to identify more than 600
additional cases of tuberculosis each year as compared with yields prior to
2007. This makes this effort one of the largest and most successful
interventions for U.S. TB control in the past decade. The results of this
study showed that the updated overseas screening guidelines led to a roughly
one-third decrease in the number of TB cases among foreign-born persons within
their first year in the United States.

CRE infections related to duodenoscopes  
**

![Image of blue gloved hand disinfecting a duodenoscope with an alcohol prep

In response to recent outbreaks of CRE (carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae) related to a type of endoscope called a duodenoscope, CDC,
with input from healthcare facilities and others, has developed an interim
protocol for facilities that want to test their duodenoscopes for
contamination after the cleaning and disinfection process. The fact that
recent outbreaks have occurred without identified lapses of infection control
is a call for action. CDC is working with partners, including the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, medical specialty societies, subject matter experts,
and state and local health departments to further understand and address the
possibility of bacteria transmission related to duodenoscopes.

NCEZID staff have published a report of the discovery of a novel Orthopoxvirus
species in the country of Georgia. The paper, which appeared in the _New
England Journal of Medicine_ (abstract: Human infection with a zoonotic
orthopoxvirus in the country of Georgia.External )this month, outlines the
investigation between CDC and Georgian health officials into two men who had
skin lesions originally thought to be cowpox. Further testing, including whole
genome sequencing, led to the discovery that the virus is a novel species.
Retrospective review of archived human specimens led to the discovery of a
third case dating back to 2010. Available evidence suggests that the virus is
zoonotic - the men had had contact with sick cows prior to becoming ill. More
surveillance and study will be needed to learn more about this new virus and
what public health interventions may be needed in the future.

While recent declines in new Ebola cases in some areas of West Africa have
been encouraging, we're seeing such a different scenario in each of the
affected countries. In Liberia, there's been considerable progress and we're
tracking what appears to be the last remaining transmission cluster of Ebola
cases. In Sierra Leone, there are still many cases of disease but also
considerable progress in terms of rapid identification of cases and contact
tracing. In Guinea, the situation remains challenging, with additional
staffing and other capacity needs and communities continuing to resist
response measures.  
Here in the United States, CDC staff have helped in many ways to enhance
domestic preparedness for Ebola. Entry screening and active monitoring help
ensure prompt detection of anyone who may have Ebola symptoms, and CDC has
given out more than 7,200 CARE Kits to travelers entering the United States
from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to help them perform daily health
checks. Our healthcare system is more prepared than ever to identify, isolate,
and treat an Ebola patient. The Laboratory Response Network has more than
quadrupled its laboratories approved to test for Ebola from just 13 labs to 55
labs in 43 states.

Collaborative report describes new method for estimating the major foods
responsible for specific foodborne illnesses  
**

![fridge brimming with eggs, jellies, fruits, and
vegetables](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/fridge-foodborne.jpg)

This month, CDC, along with the FDA and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, released a reportCdc-pdf describing a new and improved method for
analyzing outbreak data to estimate which foods are responsible for illnesses
related to four major foodborne bacteria: _Salmonella_ , _E. coli_ O157,
_Listeria monocytogenes_ , and _Campylobacter_.  
Among the report's findings: _Salmonella_ illnesses were broadly attributed
across food categories, with 77% of illnesses related to seeded vegetables
(such as tomatoes), eggs, fruits, chicken, beef, sprouts and pork. More than
80% of _E. coli_ O157 illnesses were attributed to beef and vegetable row
crops, such as leafy vegetables. More than 80% of _Listeria_ illnesses were
attributed to fruit and dairy. And nearly 75% of _Campylobacter_ illnesses
were attributed to dairy and chicken.  
This is the first major report from the Interagency Food Safety Analytics
Collaboration (IFSAC), a partnership of the three agencies. In the coming
years, IFSAC plans to analyze more data and to continue to improve methods to
develop more refined estimates.

**

![ Illustration depicting the ultrastructural morphology exhibited by a single
Gram-positive Clostridium difficile bacillus. ](/ncezid/images/recent-
work/2015/clostridium-difficile.jpg)

_Clostridium difficile,_ also known as _C. diff_ , caused almost half a
million infections among patients in the United States in a single year,
according to a study released this month and published in the Burden of
_Clostridium difficile_ infection in the United StatesExternal . According to
the authors, around 29,000 patients died within 30 days after they were first
diagnosed with _C. diff_., and about 15,000 of those deaths were estimated to
be directly attributable to _C. diff_ infections. More than 80% of the deaths
associated with _C. diff_ were among Americans aged 65 years or older. _C.
difficile_ causes an inflammation of the colon and deadly diarrhea. This new
study found that 1 out of every 5 patients with a healthcare-associated _C.
diff_ infection had a recurrence of the infection.

Ebola Update  
**

![facebook photo advertising a facebook Q&A on Jan

NCEZID staff remain a large part of the 2014-2016 West Africa Outbreak
response both at home and abroad. As of January 26, there have been 13,702
laboratory-confirmed cases and 8,818 probable, suspected, and confirmed deaths
reported in the hardest hit countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
While the outbreak is still ongoing, recent case counts offer some hope that
there will be an end, with each country reporting a decline in the growth of
new cases.

No additional cases of Ebola have been reported in the United States, and
entry screening and post-arrival monitoring is no longer in place for
travelers coming from Mali, although it continues for Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone. CDC teams have been hard at work helping our country's
healthcare system prepare for any possible future cases, including completing
training for Ebola treatment centers and focusing on assessment hospitals that
can safely receive, isolate, test, and care for an Ebola patient for up to 5
days until a diagnosis can be confirmed or ruled out and until discharge or
transfer is completed.

In our continuing efforts to keep the public engaged and informed about the
Ebola response, CDC held a Facebook Q&A featuring four NCEZID staff involved
in various areas of the response. They responded to scores of questions and
reached 13,264,277 individuals.

A _Listeria_ outbreak affected at least 32 people in 11 states between October
and December 2014. Seven of those people died. Using whole genome sequencing,
CDC was able to identify the illnesses as a cluster 1 week faster than would
have occurred with the older methods. CDC worked with state and local health
departments, the US Food and Drug Administration, and industry to identify
prepackaged caramel apples as the source of the outbreak.  Investigation
partners were then able to take action to inform the public and get caramel
apples off the shelves to keep more people from becoming ill.

HAI Progress Report:First Snapshot of State Efforts to Prevent MRSA and Deadly
_C. diff_ Infections  
**

![National and State Healthcare-associated Infection Progress
Report](/ncezid/images/recent-work/2015/hai-report.jpg)

CDC's National and State Healthcare-associated Infection Progress ReportCdc-
pdf, just released this month, shows how each state and the country are doing
in eliminating six types of infections that hospitals are required to report
to CDC. More than 3000 hospitals reported on each of the measures. For the
first time, the report provides a snapshot of state efforts to prevent MRSA
and deadly _C. diff_ infections.

States have made progress in eliminating infections that commonly threaten
hospital patients, including a 46% decrease in central line-associated
bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) from 2008 to 2013. More work is needed,
however, to continue to improve patient safety.

The Office of Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) recently encouraged research
advances in culture-independent diagnostic testing through its "No-Petri-Dish"
Diagnostic Test Challenge, announced through Challenge.govExternal. The
competition challenged participants to describe a novel or innovative method
to straintype and characterize pathogenic organisms directly from a complex
clinical sample without the need for culture or culture-based amplification.
Reference Genomics, Inc. won the $200,000 Challenge prize for their One Codex
bioinformatics platform. The www.onecodex.comExternal analysis platform can
rapidly identify Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) from complex clinical
samples and provide meaningful information about its strain type and
characteristics, even when the pathogens are present at levels too low to
support assembly-based methods. The winners will use the Challenge prize to
continue developing the One Codex platform

Since early spring 2014, teams from NCEZID, along with staff across CDC, have
been working to stop the largest Ebola epidemic in history. Close to 300
NCEZID personnel have been deployed to West Africa to assist with response
efforts, including surveillance, contact tracing, data management, laboratory
testing, and health education. Hundreds of other NCEZID staff have been
working in the Emergency Operations Center in Atlanta to provide technical
expertise, logistics, staffing, communication, analytics, management, and
other support functions for the response. Others have been partnering with US
Customs and Border Protection to conduct enhanced entry screening at five US
airports, including developing routine processes to identify travelers who
show signs of infectious disease. Another important focus for many NCEZID
staff has been on preparing US healthcare facilities to safely manage a
patient with suspected Ebola virus disease.
