#  Wildfires

Also called: Forest Fire, Wildland Fire

## Summary

Wildfires are fires that burn out of control in a natural area, like a forest,
grassland, or prairie. They often begin unnoticed. They spread quickly, and
can damage natural resources, destroy homes, and threaten the safety of the
public and firefighters.

Humans cause most wildfires. It can be an accident, like when people don't
take care of their campfire properly, burn debris, or are careless when
getting rid of their cigarettes. It can also be on purpose, which is called
arson. Lightning and lava also can also causes wildfires. Wildfires are more
common when conditions are dry. High winds can make them spread more quickly.

Although there are no guarantees of safety if you live in an area threatened
by a wildfire, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a
disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If
you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help
in finding ways to cope.
