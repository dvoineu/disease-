## Summary

You see them all the time in the news - the number of people who were in the
hospital last year, the percentage of kids who are overweight, the rate at
which people are catching the flu, the average cost of a medical procedure.
These are all types of health statistics.

Health statistics are numbers about some aspect of health. Statistics about
births, deaths, marriages, and divorces are sometimes called "vital
statistics." Researchers use statistics to see patterns of diseases in groups
of people. This can help in figuring out who is at risk for certain diseases,
finding ways to control diseases and deciding which diseases should be
studied.
