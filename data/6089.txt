Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of feeding that bypasses the
gastrointestinal tract. Fluids are given into a vein to provide most of the
nutrients the body needs. The method is used when a person cannot or should
not receive feedings or fluids by mouth.

## Information

Sick or premature newborns may be given TPN before starting other feedings.
They may also have this type of feeding when they cannot absorb nutrients
through the gastrointestinal tract for a long time. TPN delivers a mixture of
fluid, electrolytes, sugars, amino acids (protein), vitamins, minerals, and
often lipids (fats) into an infant's vein. TPN can be lifesaving for very
small or very sick babies. It can provide a better level of nutrition than
regular intravenous (IV) feedings, which provide only sugars and salts.

Infants who get this type of feeding must be watched carefully to make sure
they are getting the proper nutrition. Blood and urine tests help the health
care team know what changes are needed.

HOW IS TPN GIVEN?

An IV line is often placed in a vein in the baby's hand, foot, or scalp. A
large vein in the belly button (umbilical vein) may be used. Sometimes a
longer IV, called a central line or peripherally-inserted central catheter
(PICC) line, is used for long-term IV feedings.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

TPN is a major benefit for babies who cannot get nutrition in other ways.
However, this type of feeding can result in abnormal levels of blood sugars,
fats, or electrolytes.

Problems can develop due to use of the TPN or IV lines. The line may move out
of place or clots may form. A serious infection called sepsis is a possible
complication of a central line IV. Infants who receive TPN will be closely
monitored by the health care team.

Long-term use of TPN may lead to liver problems.
