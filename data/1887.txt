## Summary

### What are triglycerides?

Triglycerides are a type of fat. They are the most common type of fat in your
body. They come from foods, especially butter, oils, and other fats you eat.
Triglycerides also come from extra calories. These are the calories that you
eat, but your body does not need right away. Your body changes these extra
calories into triglycerides, and stores them in fat cells. When your body
needs energy, it releases the triglycerides. Your VLDL cholesterol particles
carry the triglycerides to your tissues.

Having a high level of triglycerides can raise your risk of heart diseases,
such as coronary artery disease.

### What causes high triglycerides?

Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include

    * Regularly eating more calories that you burn off, especially if you eat a lot of sugar
    * Being overweight of having obesity
    * Cigarette smoking
    * Excessive alcohol use
    * Certain medicines
    * Some genetic disorders
    * Thyroid diseases
    * Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes
    * Liver or kidney diseases

### How are high triglycerides diagnosed?

There is a blood test that measures your triglycerides, along with your
cholesterol. Triglyceride levels are measured in milligrams per deciliter
(mg/dL). The guidelines for triglyceride levels are

Category | Triglcyeride Level  
---|---  
Normal | Less than 150mg/dL  
Borderline high | 150 to 199 mg/dL  
High | 200 to 499 mg/dL  
Very high | 500 mg/dL and above  
  

Levels above 150mg/dl may raise your risk for heart disease. A triglyceride
level of 150 mg/dL or higher is also a risk factor for metabolic syndrome.

### What are the treatments for high triglycerides?

You may be able to lower your triglyceride levels with lifestyle changes:

    * Controlling your weight
    * Regular physical activity
    * Not smoking
    * Limiting sugar and refined foods
    * Limiting alcohol
    * Switching from saturated fats to healthier fats

Some people will also need to take cholesterol medicines to lower their
triglycerides.
