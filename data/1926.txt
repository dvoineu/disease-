## Summary

Your ankle bone and the ends of your two lower leg bones make up the ankle
joint. Your ligaments, which connect bones to one another, stabilize and
support it. Your muscles and tendons move it.

The most common ankle problems are sprains and fractures (broken bones). A
sprain is an injury to the ligaments. It may take a few weeks to many months
to heal completely. A fracture is a break in a bone. You can also injure other
parts of the ankle such as tendons, which join muscles to bone, and cartilage,
which cushions your joints. Ankle sprains and fractures are common sports
injuries.
