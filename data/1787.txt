## Summary

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look
at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI
scans to diagnose a variety of conditions, from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs
are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord.

During the scan, you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped
machine. Doing the scan can take a long time, and you must stay still. The
scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may
offer you earplugs.

Before you get a scan, tell your doctor if you

    * Are pregnant 
    * Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.
    * Have metal or electronic devices in your body, such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint
