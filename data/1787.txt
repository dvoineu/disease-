# Marburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF)

Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967, when outbreaks of hemorrhagic
fever occurred simultaneously in laboratories in Marburg and Frankfurt,
Germany and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Thirty-one people became
ill, initially laboratory workers followed by several medical personnel and
family members who had cared for them. Seven deaths were reported. The first
people infected had been exposed to imported African green monkeys or their
tissues while conducting research. One additional case was diagnosed
retrospectively.

The reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit bat,  _Rousettus
aegyptiacus_. Fruit bats infected with Marburg virus do not to show obvious
signs of illness. Primates (including humans) can become infected with Marburg
virus, and may develop serious disease with high mortality. Further study is
needed to determine if other species may also host the virus.

Uganda: The Hunt for Marburg Virus

CDC scientists have spearheaded a small pilot project deep inside the forests
of Uganda to track the movement of bats that carry the deadly Marburg virus, a
close cousin to Ebola. Scientists collect bats in Python Cave and attach GPS
units on the backs of these bats to capture their movements to better
understand how the Marburg virus is spread to people.
