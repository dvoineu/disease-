## Summary

An ostomy is surgery to create an opening (stoma) from an area inside the body
to the outside. It treats certain diseases of the digestive or urinary
systems. It can be permanent, when an organ must be removed. It can be
temporary, when the organ needs time to heal. The organ could be the small
intestine, colon, rectum, or bladder. With an ostomy, there must be a new way
for wastes to leave the body.

There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples are

    * Ileostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon, rectum and anus.
    * Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus. 
    * Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.
