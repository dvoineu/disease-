An ear drainage culture is a lab test. This test checks for germs that can
cause infection. The sample taken for this test canÂ contain fluid, pus, wax,
or blood from the ear.

## How the Test is Performed

A sample of ear drainage is needed. Your health care provider will use a
cotton swab to collect the sample from inside the outer ear canal. In some
cases, a sample is collected from the middle ear during ear surgery.

The sample is sent to a lab and placed on a special dish (culture media).

The lab team checks the dish every day to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses
have grown. More tests may be done to look for specific germs and determine
the best treatment.

## How to Prepare for the Test

You do not need to prepare for this test.

## How the Test will Feel

Using a cotton swab to take a sample of drainage from the outer ear is not
painful. However, ear pain may be present if the ear is infected.

Ear surgery is done using general anesthesia. You will be asleep and feel no
pain.

## Why the Test is Performed

The test may be done if you or your child has:

    * An ear infection that is not getting better with treatment
    * An infection of the outer ear (otitis externa)
    * An ear infection with a ruptured eardrum and draining fluid 

It may also be done as a routine part of myringotomy.

Note: Ear infections are diagnosed based on symptoms rather than using a
culture.

## Normal Results

The test is normal if there is no growth on the culture.

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to
your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

## What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be a sign of an infection. The infection can be caused by
bacteria, virus, or fungus.

The test results may show which organism is causing the infection. It will
help your provider decide on the right treatment.

## Risks

No risks are involved with swabbing the ear canal. Ear surgery may involve
some risks.

## Alternative Names

Culture - ear drainage
