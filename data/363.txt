## Summary

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a type of amino acid metabolism disorder. It is
inherited. If you have it, your body can't process part of a protein called
phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is in almost all foods. If your Phe level gets too
high, it can damage your brain and cause severe intellectual disability. All
babies born in U.S. hospitals must now have a screening test for PKU. This
makes it easier to diagnose and treat the problem early.

The best treatment for PKU is a diet of low-protein foods. There are special
formulas for newborns. For older children and adults, the diet includes many
fruits and vegetables. It also includes some low-protein breads, pastas and
cereals. Nutritional formulas provide the vitamins and minerals you can't get
from their food.

Babies who get on this special diet soon after they are born develop normally.
Many have no symptoms of PKU. It is important to stay on the diet for the rest
of your life.
