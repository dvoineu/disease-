## Summary

Your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back.
It carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain. It is
protected by your vertebrae, which are the bone disks that make up your spine.
If you have an accident that damages the vertebrae or other parts of the
spine, this can also injure the spinal cord. Other spinal cord problems
include

    * Tumors
    * Infections such as meningitis and polio
    * Inflammatory diseases
    * Autoimmune diseases 
    * Degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy

Symptoms vary but might include pain, numbness, loss of sensation and muscle
weakness. These symptoms can occur around the spinal cord, and also in other
areas such as your arms and legs. Treatments often include medicines and
surgery.
