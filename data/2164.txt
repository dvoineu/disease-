#  Vitamin E

## Summary

Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally.
Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It plays a role in your immune system and
metabolic processes.

Good sources of vitamin E include

    * Vegetable oils
    * Margarine
    * Nuts and seeds
    * Leafy greens

Vitamin E is also added to foods like cereals. Most people get enough vitamin
E from the foods they eat. People with certain disorders, such as liver
diseases, cystic fibrosis, and Crohn's disease may need extra vitamin E.

Vitamin E supplements may be harmful for people who take blood thinners and
other medicines. Check with your health care provider before taking the
supplements.
