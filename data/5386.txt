This updated guidance is intended to assist air medical transport (AMT)
service providers in using specialized and/or specially equipped aircraft to
transport Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients while ensuring the
safety of patients and transport personnel. This guidance does not apply to
commercial passenger aircraft. The recommendations are based on standard
infection prevention and control practices, AMT standards, and epidemiologic
information from investigations of MERS, including experience from air
transport of patients during the 2003 SARS outbreak.

Currently recommended infection prevention and control measures for
hospitalized patients with MERS include Standard Precautions (with eye
protection to prevent droplet exposure) plus Contact and Airborne Isolation
Precautions. Respiratory protection using respirators providing at least 95%
filtering efficiency (e.g., NIOSH-certified N-95 or higher-level filtering
facepiece respirator) with appropriate fit-testingexternal icon is
recommended.



##  Air Transport of MERS Patients: General Considerations

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * MERS patients should be transported on a dedicated AMT mission with the minimum number of crew members. **Whenever possible, no passengers or patients who do not have MERS should be on board.** If a parent is accompanying a sick child, the parent should use personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport as described in "Infection Control," below.

The size and type of aircraft will influence the extent to which these
measures can be implemented. When available, use of a portable isolation unit
may be considered.

Removal of respiratory protection is unavoidable. An area at the front of the plane (or "upwind" from the patient, depending on cabin air flow), as far as possible from the patient, should be designated for this purpose.

Callers will be connected with the CDC Quarantine Station responsible for the airport of arrival. U.S. federal regulations require the commander of an aircraft destined for the United States to report any deaths and certain illnesses among travelers to CDC before arrival.

##  Airframe Selection and Cabin Airflow

Cabin airflow characteristics may reduce exposure of occupants to airborne
infectious particles. Whenever possible, aircraft used to medically evacuate
patients with MERS should have separate air-handling systems for the cockpit
and cabin, with cockpit air at positive pressure relative to the cabin.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * AMT service providers should consult the manufacturer(s) of their aircraft to identify cabin airflow characteristics, including: HEPA filtration and directional airflow capabilities, air outlet location, presence or absence of air mixing between cockpit and patient-care cabin during flight, and time and aircraft configuration required to perform a post-mission airing-out of the aircraft.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Aircraft with forward-to-aft cabin air flow and a separate cockpit cabin are strongly preferred for transport of MERS patients. Aft-to-forward cabin air flow may increase the risk of airborne exposure of cabin and flight deck personnel. Aircraft that re-circulate cabin and flight-deck air without HEPA filtration should not be selected for MERS patient transport.

### Rotor-wing and non-pressurized aircraft

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * In aircraft with uncontrolled interior air flow, such as rotor-wing and small, non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft, all personnel should wear disposable N-95 or higher-level respirators during transport of MERS patients. For cockpit crews, aircraft aviator tight-fitting face pieces capable of delivering oxygen that has not mixed with cabin air may be used in lieu of a disposable N-95 respirator.

##  Patient Placement

The airflow of each aircraft should form the basis for litter and seat
assignments. In general:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * MERS patients should be positioned as far downwind with regard to cabin air flow as possible.

The distance will depend on the area required for patient care support; a minimum distance of 6 feet from the patient is recommended. If a bathroom is being used for the patient it should be within the isolation area.

##  Ground/In-Flight Emergency Procedures

AMT service providers should have a written plan addressing patient handling
during in-flight and/or ground emergency situations. Activities such as
donning life vests and litter-patient emergency egress may create special
exposure risks. Use of respirators must be weighed against time constraints
and on-board emergency conditions (e.g., smoke in the cabin, sudden cabin
decompression). Gowns and latex gloves represent a fire/flash hazard and
should not be worn during ground or in-flight emergency situations.
