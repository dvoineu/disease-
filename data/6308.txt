The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria
(NARMS) was established in 1996. NARMS is a collaboration among state and
local public health departments, CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

This national public health surveillance system tracks changes in the
antimicrobial susceptibility of certain enteric (intestinal) bacteria found in
ill people (CDC), retail meats (FDA), and food animals (USDA) in the United
States. The NARMS program at CDC helps protect public health by providing
information about emerging bacterial resistance, the ways in which resistance
is spread, and how resistant infections differ from susceptible infections.
