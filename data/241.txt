#  Botox

Also called: Botulinum toxin type A

## Summary

Botox is a drug made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium
botulinum. It's the same toxin that causes a life-threatening type of food
poisoning called botulism. Doctors use it in small doses to treat health
problems, including

  * Temporary smoothing of facial wrinkles and improving your appearance
  * Severe underarm sweating 
  * Cervical dystonia - a neurological disorder that causes severe neck and shoulder muscle contractions 
  * Blepharospasm - uncontrollable blinking 
  * Strabismus - misaligned eyes 
  * Chronic migraine
  * Overactive bladder

Botox injections work by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by
blocking certain nerves. The effects last about three to twelve months,
depending on what you are treating. The most common side effects are pain,
swelling, or bruising at the injection site. You could also have flu-like
symptoms, headache, and upset stomach. Injections in the face may also cause
temporary drooping eyelids. You should not use Botox if you are pregnant or
breastfeeding.
