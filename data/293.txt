## Summary

Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. The two
most common types are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. They usually
form on the head, face, neck, hands, and arms. Another type of skin cancer,
melanoma, is more dangerous but less common.

Anyone can get skin cancer, but it is more common in people who

  * Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburned
  * Have light-colored skin, hair and eyes
  * Have a family member with skin cancer
  * Are over age 50

You should have your doctor check any suspicious skin markings and any changes
in the way your skin looks. Treatment is more likely to work well when cancer
is found early. If not treated, some types of skin cancer cells can spread to
other tissues and organs. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and biologic therapy. PDT uses a
drug and a type of laser light to kill cancer cells. Biologic therapy boosts
your body's own ability to fight cancer.
