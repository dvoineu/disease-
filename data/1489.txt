# XMRV (Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-related Virus)

Minus

Related Pages

XMRV is a newly identified human retrovirus that is similar to a group of
mouse retroviruses (called murine leukemia viruses, or MLVs) scientists have
known about for years. XMRV refers to xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related
virus. It was first identified in 2006 in tissue samples from men with
prostate cancer.

In a study published in the journal _Science_ in October 2009, scientists
reported a potential association of XMRV with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
In this study, XMRV was detected in approximately two-thirds of patients
diagnosed with CFS. They also identified DNA of XMRV in the blood cells of
some healthy persons and suggested a potential for XMRV transmission by
transfusion or transplantation.

However, other recent studies, including a July 2010 research report from CDC
scientists and colleagues at two other institutions, found no evidence of XMRV
in CFS patients and in controls (see Updates).

More recently, investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Harvard Medical School published a
report that presents evidence of MLVs in blood samples from CFS patients and
healthy blood donors.  The authors state that although they found a broader
group of MLVs, rather than XMRV, their results support the 2009 report in
_Science_. The FDA /NIH paper was published online August 23, 2010, in the
_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences._

The reporting of different findings from different studies is not uncommon.
Various factors may have contributed to the differences in these studies,
including selection criteria for inclusion of CFS patients, clinical
complexities of CFS, and possible variations in XMRV and MLV infection rates
among populations in different regions.  Moreover, XMRV is a recently
discovered virus and much remains to be learned about this and  MLV-like
viruses.  As additional studies are done, it is possible that new findings may
emerge that differ from what has been previously reported.

The potential role of XMRV and MLVs in causing diseases such as prostate
cancer and CFS remains unknown at this time. Additional research is needed to
further evaluate a possible link of XMRV and MLVs with negative health
outcomes, including prostate cancer and CFS. If it is determined that XMRV and
MLVs may have a role in causing disease and illness, prevention
recommendations can be made.

Although it is presumed that XMRV can be transmitted through blood
transfusion, no such transmission event has been identified, and there is no
known evidence of XMRV or MLV infection or related illness or disease in
transfusion recipients. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) are conducting studies to determine the prevalence of XMRV in
the blood donor population.

CDC, FDA, and NIH investigators have been  collaborating with scientists from
other agencies and groups with regard to XMRV and MLV research, and they will
continue to do so.  HHS agencies will keep the public updated and informed as
more information becomes available.
