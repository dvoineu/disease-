## Summary

Latex is a milky fluid that comes from the tropical rubber tree. Hundreds of
everyday products contain latex. Repeated exposure to a protein in natural
latex can make you more likely to develop a latex allergy. If your immune
system detects the protein, a reaction can start in minutes. You could get a
rash or asthma. In rare cases you could have a severe reaction called
anaphylaxis.

Your doctor may use a physical exam and skin and blood tests to diagnose it.
There are medicines to treat a reaction, but it is best to try to avoid latex.
Common latex products include

    * Gloves
    * Condoms
    * Balloons
    * Rubber bands
    * Shoe soles
    * Pacifiers

You can find latex-free versions of these products.
