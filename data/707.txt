# MedlinePlus Connect: Web Service

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

MedlinePlus Connect is available as a Web application or Web service. Below
are the technical details for implementing the Web service, which responds to
requests based on:

    * diagnosis (problem) codes 
    * medication codes, 
    * and lab test codes.

You are welcome to link to and display the data returned by MedlinePlus
Connect. You may not copy MedlinePlus pages onto your site. If you use data
from the MedlinePlus Connect Web Service, please indicate that the information
is from MedlinePlus.gov but do not use the MedlinePlus logo or otherwise imply
that MedlinePlus endorses your particular product. Please see NLM's API page
for further guidance. For more information on how to link to MedlinePlus
content outside of this service, please see our guidelines and instructions on
linking.

If you decide to use MedlinePlus Connect, sign up for the email list to keep
up with developments and exchange ideas with your colleagues. Please tell us
if you implement MedlinePlus Connect by contacting us.

## Web Service Overview

The parameters for the Web service requests conform to the HL7 Context-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval (Infobutton) Knowledge Request URL-Based Implementation
Guide. The REST-based response conforms to the HL7 Context-Aware Knowledge
Retrieval (Infobutton) Service-Oriented Architecture Implementation Guide. The
output of the request can be XML in the Atom feed format, JSON, or JSONP.

The structure of the request indicates what type of code you are sending. In
all cases, the base URL for the Web service is:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service

MedlinePlus Connect uses HTTPS connections. HTTP requests will not be accepted
and existing implementations using HTTP should update to HTTPS.

## Output Parameters

These parameters are optional. If you leave them out, the default response is
English information in XML format.

Language  
Identify if you would like the response to be in English or Spanish.
MedlinePlus Connect will assume English is the language if it is not
specified.

If you wish the response to the problem code lookup to be in Spanish, use :
informationRecipient.languageCode.c=es  
(=sp also accepted)

To specify English, use the following: informationRecipient.languageCode.c=en

Format  
Identify if you would like the response format to be XML, JSON, or JSONP. XML
is the default.

To request JSON, use:

    knowledgeResponseType=application/json

For JSONP, use:

    knowledgeResponseType=application/javascript&callback=CallbackFunction where CallbackFunction is a name you give the call back function. 

For a response in XML, use:

    knowledgeResponseType=text/xml or leave the knowledgeResponseType parameter out of the request. 

## Requests for Diagnosis (Problem) Codes

For a problem code, MedlinePlus Connect will return links and information for
up to three MedlinePlus health topic pages. The service can provide a response
to a diagnosis code request in English or Spanish.

MedlinePlus Connect will return the following:

    * MedlinePlus health topic page title (up to three matches). To see the range of possible matches, refer to the full list of MedlinePlus health topics. 
    * MedlinePlus health topic page URL 
    * Synonyms for that topic ("Also called") 
    * MedlinePlus health topic summary, including formatting and links to other appropriate MedlinePlus topics 
    * Summary attribution 
    * Selected links for patients, including formatting, the page name, URL, and associated organization (when applicable) 

For SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM codes, some requests may yield up to twenty
responses from Genetics Home Reference (GHR) in addition to or instead of
MedlinePlus responses. If there are GHR responses, they will follow any
MedlinePlus responses and can be distinguished by the URL. Currently GHR
responses are available only for English SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM requests.
MedlinePlus Connect will return the following for each response:

    * GHR page title 
    * GHR page URL 
    * GHR page summary 

There may not always be a match for each code. In those cases, MedlinePlus
Connect will return a null response.  
The base URL of the service is: https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service

There are two required parameters for any query to this service:

    1. Code System  
Identify the problem code system you will be using.

For ICD-10-CM use:

    mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.90

For ICD-9-CM use:

    mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.103

For SNOMED CT use:

    mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.96
    2. Code  
Identify the actual code that you are trying to look up:
mainSearchCriteria.v.c=250.33

### Optional Parameters

Code Title  
You may also identify the name/title of the problem code. However, this
information does not impact the response (unlike the MedlinePlus Connect Web
application where the name/title information may be used).
mainSearchCriteria.v.dn=Diabetes mellitus with other coma type 1 uncontrolled
See the above section on Output Parameters for details on language and output
formats.

### Description of Selected Atom Elements (or JSON objects) in Response to
Problem Code Requests

title |   | Title of matched MedlinePlus health topic page or GHR page  
link |   | URL for matched MedlinePlus health topic page or GHR page  
summary |   | The full summary for the health topic. This includes embedded
links to other relevant health topics, and all formatting, including bullets
and paragraph spacing. The summary is in HTML. For GHR pages, the first
section of the full page is provided.  
summary | class="NLMalsoCalled" | Synonyms for the topic. These are referred
to as "Also called" on a health topic page. Not all topics have "Also called"
terms.  
summary | class="NLMattribution" | Attribution acknowledgement for summary
text, if the majority of the summary was from another federal agency. Not all
summaries have an attribution. Unattributed text is original to MedlinePlus.  
summary | class="NLMrelatedLinks" | Selected links associated with the topic.
This includes the page name, URL, and associated organization (when
applicable). The links are formatted in a bulleted list. Not all topics have
these links. The number of links can range from zero to dozens.  
  
### Examples of Requests for Problem Codes

A complete request for Diabetes Mellitus with other coma type 1 uncontrolled,
ICD-9 code 250.33, for a Spanish speaking patient would have the following URL
address:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service?mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.103&mainSearchCriteria.v.c;=250.33&mainSearchCriteria.v.dn;=Diabetes%20mellitus%20with%20other%20coma%20type%201%20uncontrolled&informationRecipient.languageCode.c;=es

to problem codes, investigate the MedlinePlus Web service. Also, if you need
the full set of MedlinePlus health topics in XML format, see our XML files
page.

## Requests for Drug Information

MedlinePlus Connect provides the best drug information matches when receiving
an RXCUI. It also provides good results when receiving an NDC code.
MedlinePlus Connect can provide responses in English or Spanish.

For requests for English medication information, if you do not send an NDC or
RXCUI or if we find no match based on the code, the application will use the
text string that you send to display the best drug information match. For
requests for Spanish medication information, MedlinePlus Connect responds only
to NDCs or RXCUIs and does not use text strings. It is possible to have a
reponse in English but no response in Spanish.

The MedlinePlus Connect Web service will return the following:

    * MedlinePlus medication page title
    * MedlinePlus medication page URL
    * Source attribution for the content

There could be multiple responses to one medication request. There may not
always be a match for each request. In those cases, MedlinePlus Connect will
return a null response.

For requests for drug information, the base URL is:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service

To send a request, include these pieces of information:

    1. Code System  
Identify the type of medication code you are sending. (Required for English
and Spanish)  

For RXCUI use:

    mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.88

For NDC use:

    mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.69
MedlinePlus Connect can also accept a text string for requests for medication
information in English, but you must indicate you are looking for medication
information by including one of the two code systems listed above.

    2. Code  
Identify the actual code that you are trying to look up. (Preferred for
English, Required for Spanish) mainSearchCriteria.v.c=637188

    3. Drug Name  
Identify the name of the drug with a text string. (Optional for English, Not
used for Spanish) mainSearchCriteria.v.dn=Chantix 0.5 MG Oral Tablet

At a minimum you should identify the code system and the code, or the code
system and the name of the drug. Send all three for best results for English
requests. Send the code system and the code for Spanish requests.

### Optional Parameters

Code Title

When sending a request for English information, you may include the optional
parameter of the name of the medication. This is detailed in the above
section. mainSearchCriteria.v.dn=Chantix 0.5 MG Oral Tablet

See the above section on Output Parameters for details on language and output
formats.

### Description of Selected Atom Elements (or JSON objects) in Response to
Medication Requests

Element | Description  
---|---  
title | Title for matched MedlinePlus medication page  
link | URL for the matched MedlinePlus medication page  
author | Source attribution for medication information  
  
### Examples of Requests for Drug Codes

Your medication information request should look like one of the following.

To request information by an RXCUI, your request should look like this:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service?mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.88&mainSearchCriteria.v.c;=637188&mainSearchCriteria.v.dn;=Chantix%200.5%20MG%20Oral%20Tablet&informationRecipient.languageCode.c=en

To request information by an NDC for a Spanish speaker, your request should
look like this:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service?mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.69&mainSearchCriteria.v.c;=00310-0751-39&informationRecipient.languageCode.c;=es

To send a text string without a medication code, you must identify your query
as an NDC-type request so MedlinePlus Connect knows you are looking for
medication information. This will work for English requests only. Your request
could look like this:
https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service?mainSearchCriteria.v.cs=2.16.840.1.113883.6.69&mainSearchCriteria.v.dn;=Chantix%200.5%20MG%20Oral%20Tablet&informationRecipient.languageCode.c=en

## Acceptable Use Policy

In order to avoid overloading the MedlinePlus servers, NLM requires that users
of MedlinePlus Connect send no more than 100 requests per minute per IP
address. Requests that exceed this limit will not be serviced, and service
will not be restored for 300 seconds or until the request rate falls beneath
the limit, whichever comes later. To limit the number of requests that you
send to Connect, NLM recommends caching results for a 12-24 hour period.

This policy is in place to ensure that the service remains available and
accessible to all users. If you have a specific use case that requires you to
send a large number of requests to MedlinePlus Connect, and thus exceed the
request rate limit outlined in this policy, please contact us. NLM staff will
evaluate your request and determine if an exception may be granted. Please
also review the MedlinePlus XML files documentation. These XML files contain
complete health topic records and can serve as an alternate method of
accessing MedlinePlus data.
