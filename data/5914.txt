### Environmental Health

![map icon for Louisiana](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/LA.jpg)

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community around you, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
affected negatively.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting public
health workers, educating communities, and providing scientific knowledge. We
help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a healthy
environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness caused by
environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might be
exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing healthcare costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

Asthma is a common disease on the rise, with significant health disparities
and associated healthcare costs. Nearly 1 in 12 Americans (26 million) have
asthma. In the last decade, the proportion of people with asthma, grew by
nearly 15%.

CDC has been working with states for more than 10 years to implement
community-based interventions, build local coalitions, and track the impact of
the disease on the U.S. population.

The program focuses on what works to control asthma: assessing and measuring
changes in disease severity and control, using the right medications,
educating people to manage their conditions, and controlling environmental
irritants and allergens.

Even though the number of people with asthma has increased over the last 10
years, trends show that more are controlling their disease:

**Lead Poisoning Prevention Program**

(FY 2011 funding for Louisiana--$594,000; because of funding reductions, the
program was discontinued in 2012. Some funding was restored in FY 2014. States
will be recompeting for funding and more information will be available later
in the year.)

More than 12 million U.S. children are exposed to lead in their homes at
levels that can harm their intellectual development. No safe blood lead level
in children has been identified.

Reducing children's lead exposure is perhaps the greatest environmental health
accomplishment in the past 20 years.

For more than 20 years, CDC has funded state and local health agencies to

Children who are exposed to lead lose $3,000 to almost $8,000 in lifetime
productivity for each 1 microgram per deciliter (μg/dL) increase in blood lead
level. Blood lead levels over 1 μg/dL are associated with measurable
reductions in IQ.

Between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, interventions that control or eliminate lead
hazards before children are exposed (primary prevention) helped reduce the
number of children exposed to lead (blood lead levels ≥ 1μg/dL) by nearly 3
million, saving $26-57 billion in lifetime productivity earnings alone. These
estimates do not account for behavioral and other adverse effects on lifetime
productivity linked to lead.

**Environmental Public Health Tracking Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Louisiana--$441,000. A new funding announcement has been
released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the year.)

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 25% of all diseases
are caused by environmental exposures. Some of these diseases--such as cancer,
asthma, and cardiovascular disease--are the greatest killers today.

CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (a.k.a. Tracking Network)
is a dynamic web-based tool that tracks and reports environmental hazards and
the health problems that may be related to them.

The Tracking Network's integrated health, environmental exposure, and hazard
information is used to

**Safe Water Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Louisiana--$165,000. FY 2014 funding information will be
available later in the year.)

About 15% of households in the United States get their drinking water from
private wells and other unregulated sources where little is known about the
quality of water.

The Safe Water Program prevents human exposure to and disease from infectious
and non-infectious waterborne contaminants by

### Public Health in Action

**Asthma Control in Louisiana**

Louisianans with asthma face a higher risk of dying than people with asthma
who live in other parts of the United States. About 200,000 adults in the
state have asthma. In 2007, about 12 percent of households in the state
included a child with asthma. In the past year, more than 5 percent of
children absent from school were absent because of asthma. And children
younger than 5 years of age who have asthma visit the hospital more than any
other asthma-afflicted age group. However, for all groups, from 2002 to 2007
the number of asthma-related deaths declined.

Louisiana's Asthma Management and Prevention Program supported by CDC focuses
on populations with the greatest needs. These efforts are paying off:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Louisiana The state asthma control program is helping school districts earn the state's asthma-friendly designation. The program and its partners have trained more than 1,000 school personnel on asthma care and prevention and have helped identify hundreds of children living with asthma. For example, in three districts, an additional 260 action plans for students with asthma are now on file in their schools. Also, all three asthma-friendly school districts adopted indoor and outdoor air policies, such as requiring school buses to turn off their engines while idling. School-based activities are reaching more than 13,000 Louisiana schoolchildren.

Training focuses on reducing asthma symptoms and further encourages clinicians to equip patients with the tools to independently manage their asthma.

**Lead Poisoning Prevention in Louisiana ***

The following describes activities carried out in previous years with the
support of CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program when it was fully funded:

The Louisiana Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program allowed officials to
follow up on approximately 800 children and 135 adults in the state newly
diagnosed with lead poisoning each year. Louisiana law requires that every
child between the age of 72 months and 6 years receive a lead screening. Each
child identified with lead exposure requires a home investigation that can
cost anywhere from $550 to $770. Medicaid reimburses only $22; therefore, CDC
funds were essential to supporting home investigations. Officials inspected
homes and ordered repairs for units with lead hazards. Since 2002, the state
has maintained a data system to capture the results of blood tests for lead.
These data enabled the program to identify high-risk areas for lead poisoning
and to guide program activities. The program used surveillance data to find
that lead exposure disproportionately affects low-income and minority
populations in the state. Louisiana's program conducts community outreach and
provides educational resources to the public through the program's website,
news releases, and presentations at community events.

**Tracking Well Water Issues in Louisiana**

![Ferryboat on a river](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/LA4-small.jpg)

Louisiana has a large number of residential water wells located within a mile
of an operating or abandoned wood preservation or wood treatment facility. No
Louisiana law requires private well water testing. This lack of testing limits
the public health department's ability to assess potential exposures to
chemicals through well water.

In partnership with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the
state's Safe Drinking Water Program, staff from the Louisiana Public Health
Tracking program conducted a pilot project to link information about the
environmental, information about chemical exposures, and information about
health status around wood preservation and treatment sites. The pilot project
included

As a result of the pilot project, many Louisiana residents contacted the
health department to obtain information on how they could get their private
well water tested. Such an initiative should help reduce potential exposures
to contaminated well water because well owners will be more likely to
understand what possible chemical exposures exist in their well water.
