Background

 **Background:  **Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB
bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain.
TB disease is almost always curable if treated promptly with the correct
medications. If not treated properly, however, TB disease can be fatal. TB is
spread through the air from one person to another. Not everyone infected with
TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent
TB infection and TB disease. People with latent TB infection are not
infectious and cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if TB bacteria
become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent
TB infection to being sick with TB disease. The lifetime risk of progressing
from latent TB infection to TB disease is 5-10%.

Since 1953, in cooperation with state and local health departments, the United
States (U.S.) national tuberculosis program has collected information on each
newly reported case of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the United States. In the
early 20th century, TB was the leading cause of death in the United States.
From that point TB cases steadily declined until the 1980s and early 1990s
when a TB resurgence occurred with over 25,000 TB cases being reported per
year. The resurgence was associated with the emergence of the HIV epidemic,
increased immigration from countries with high TB rates, and a deterioration
of TB control programs in many jurisdictions. Following a major investment in
TB control activities at all levels of government, TB cases began to decline
again. In 2014, the reported number of U.S. TB cases was 9,421, with a case
rate of 3.0 cases per 100,000 population (30 per million population). Since
the 1992 TB resurgence peak in the United States, the number of TB cases
reported annually has decreased by 65%.

Vision, Mission, and DTBE Strategic Framework

 **Vision:** Elimination of tuberculosis in the United States (defined as < 1
case/million annually)

**Mission:** The mission of the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) is
to promote health and quality of life by preventing, controlling, and
eventually eliminating tuberculosis in the United States.

**DTBE Strategic Framework:  **DTBE's strategic plan is aligned with the
_National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention
(NCHHSTP) Strategic Plan Through 2020 Cdc-pdf_. The NCHHSTP goals are to
decrease incidence of infection, decrease morbidity and mortality, and
decrease health disparities. DTBE's goal is to reduce TB morbidity in the
United States with a particular focus on reducing disparities in TB morbidity
among disproportionately affected groups, including foreign-born persons and
racial and ethnic minorities. DTBE's strategies, while similar to those laid
out in the Center's plan, focus on efforts unique to TB control and are aimed
at eliminating TB. The six specific strategies that provide the framework for
DTBE's strategic plan are derived from the U.S. government's responseCdc-pdf
to the Institute of Medicine Report, Ending Neglect: _The Elimination of
Tuberculosis in the United States (2000),_ which were reaffirmed in _A Call
for Action on the Tuberculosis Elimination Plan Cdc-pdfExternal  _published by
STOP TB USA in 2010.

Core Values and Guiding Principles

DTBE embraces the core values enumerated in NCHHSTP's strategic plan. The core
values that guide how we think and work together, how we serve our
communities, how we make decisions, and how we determine our priorities
include the following.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Accountability:** Be a diligent steward of the use of funds to achieve NCHHSTP's public health mission

High impact prevention is an approach to planning and implementing activities
that promotes efficient and effective use of limited resources. Accordingly,
DTBE will implement programs, policies and research that:

Include populations that are disproportionately affected to reduce disparities by ensuring that those with the highest rates of morbidity or who are most vulnerable are effectively reached.

Challenges and Opportunities

 **Challenges:** As U.S. TB cases continue to decrease, the perception of TB
as a public health risk diminishes as well. As a result, TB can seem to be of
lower priority to the general public and many policymakers. Competition for
public funds puts resources for TB control and research at risk. The greatest
challenges include the following.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Fewer patients with TB limits routine training opportunities in TB clinical, laboratory, research, and program efforts leading to loss of expertise and experience in TB. This loss of TB expertise and experience has resulted in decreased capacity to appropriately diagnosis, treat, manage, and prevent TB.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * TB drugs and biologics face the same problems that threaten the supply of antibiotics in general. As demand decreases and drug patents expire, manufacturers may weigh the balance of refurbishing facilities and procuring active ingredients against the profitability of the product. Research and development of new antibiotics has not kept pace with those of other types of medicine. Therefore, periodic shortages and supply interruptions of critical TB medications have occurred in the United States over the past five years, resulting in interruptions in patient treatment, delays in treatment initiation, and potential increased community exposure to TB.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * While numbers of TB cases decline, outbreaks are increasingly concentrated in more difficult-to-reach populations, including persons born outside the United States, racial and ethnic minorities, and people experiencing homelessness, incarceration, and substance/alcohol use. Also, TB is associated with other acute and chronic health conditions, including diabetes and HIV infection. The complexities of these social determinants and co-morbidities affects the resources required for successful prevention and control efforts.

**Opportunities:  **The decline of TB incidence could be accelerated by
prioritizing TB control efforts to address disparities in TB morbidity among
people in the United States who are most vulnerable to TB. These vulnerable
populations include the following.

While the U.S. reports fewer than 10,000 TB cases annually, it is estimated that up to 13 million people in the U.S. have latent TB infection. Since the study to determine this estimate did not include certain high-risk populations, such as persons experiencing homelessness or incarceration, the true burden of latent TB infection is likely greater.

Goal and Strategies

 **Goal: Reduce TB morbidity in the United States with a particular focus on
reducing disparities in TB morbidity among disproportionately affected groups,
including foreign-born persons and racial and ethnic minorities.

This collaboration indirectly supports DTBE's mission because, with 65% of U.S. TB cases occurring in foreign-born persons, reductions in global TB are critical to the goal of U.S. TB elimination. Furthermore, advances made in domestic TB control may be valuable to the global effort if they can be disseminated and implemented in other settings. In this way, DTBE's research activities (through the TB Trials Consortium and TB Epidemiologic Studies Consortium) and programmatic improvements may indirectly reduce the global TB burden.
