## Summary

Statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol. Your body needs some cholesterol
to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the
walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them.

If diet and exercise don't reduce your cholesterol levels, you may need to
take cholesterol medicine. Often, this medicine is a statin. Statins interfere
with the production of cholesterol in your liver. They lower LDL (bad)
cholesterol levels and raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. This can slow the
formation of plaques in your arteries.

Statins are relatively safe for most people. But they are not recommended for
pregnant patients or those with active or chronic liver disease. They can also
cause serious muscle problems. Some statins also interact adversely with other
drugs. You may have fewer side effects with one statin drug than another.

Researchers are also studying the use of statins for other conditions.
