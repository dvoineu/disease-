## Summary

Rubella is an infection caused by a virus. It is usually mild with fever and a
rash. About half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms. If you do
get them, symptoms may include

    * A rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body
    * Mild fever
    * Aching joints, especially in young women
    * Swollen glands

Rubella is most dangerous for a pregnant woman's baby. It can cause
miscarriage or birth defects.

Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People without
symptoms can still spread it. There is no treatment, but the measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.
