## Summary

Problems with the penis can cause pain and affect a man's sexual function and
fertility. Penis disorders include

  * Erectile dysfunction \- inability to get or keep an erection 
  * Priapism - a painful erection that does not go away 
  * Peyronie's disease - bending of the penis during an erection due to a hard lump called a plaque 
  * Balanitis - inflammation of the skin covering the head of the penis, most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised 
  * Penile cancer - a rare form of cancer, highly curable when caught early
