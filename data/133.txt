## Summary

Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is
a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12
and 16 for boys. It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls
differently.

In girls:

  * The first sign of puberty is usually breast development.
  * Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.
  * Menstruation (or a period) usually happens last.

In boys:

  * Puberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger.
  * Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.
  * Muscles grow, the voice deepens, and facial hair develops as puberty continues.

Both boys and girls may get acne. They also usually have a growth spurt (a
rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years. This brings them
closer to their adult height, which they reach after puberty.
