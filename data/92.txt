## Summary

Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. It is a
leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the
fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often
there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will
slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through
a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision
remains.

A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should
get eye exams at least every two years. They include

  * African Americans over age 40
  * People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans
  * People with a family history of glaucoma

There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can
help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include
prescription eyedrops and/or surgery.
