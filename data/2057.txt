## Summary

A vegetarian diet focuses on plants for food. These include fruits,
vegetables, dried beans and peas, grains, seeds and nuts. There is no single
type of vegetarian diet. Instead, vegetarian eating patterns usually fall into
the following groups:

    * The vegan diet, which excludes all meat and animal products
    * The lacto vegetarian diet, which includes plant foods plus dairy products
    * The lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, which includes both dairy products and eggs

People who follow vegetarian diets can get all the nutrients they need.
However, they must be careful to eat a wide variety of foods to meet their
nutritional needs. Nutrients vegetarians may need to focus on include protein,
iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.
