## Summary

An aneurysm is a bulge or "ballooning" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are
blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of
the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous
bleeding or even death.

Most aneurysms are in the aorta, the main artery that runs from the heart
through the chest and abdomen.

There are two types of aortic aneurysm:

    * Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the chest
    * Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) - these occur in the part of the aorta running through the abdomen

Most aneurysms are found during tests done for other reasons. Some people are
at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening, because
aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening
is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family
history, or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find
aneurysms. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments.
