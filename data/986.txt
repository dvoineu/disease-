Scientists think people are initially infected with Ebola virus through
contact with an infected animal, such as a fruit bat or nonhuman primate. This
is called a spillover event. After that, the virus spreads from person to
person, potentially affecting a large number of people.

The virus spreads through direct contact (such as through broken skin or
mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with:

The virus can remain in certain body fluids (including semen) of a patient who has recovered from EVD, even if they no longer have symptoms of severe illness. There is no evidence that Ebola can be spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had Ebola.

When people become infected with Ebola, they do not start developing signs or
symptoms right away. This period between exposure to an illness and having
symptoms is known as the incubation period. **A person can only spread Ebola
to other people after they develop signs and symptoms of Ebola.**

Additionally, Ebola virus is not known to be transmitted through food.
However, in certain parts of the world, Ebola virus may spread through the
handling and consumption of wild animal meat or hunted wild animals infected
with Ebola. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can transmit
Ebola virus.

Ebola can spread when people come into contact with infected blood or body fluids.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Ebola poses little risk to travelers or the general public who have not cared for or been in close contact (within 3 feet or 1 meter) with someone sick with Ebola.

## Persistence of the virus

The virus can remain in areas of the body that are immunologically privileged
sites after acute infection. These are sites where viruses and pathogens, like
the Ebola virus, are shielded from the survivor's immune system, even after
being cleared elsewhere in the body. These areas include the testes, interior
of the eyes, placenta, and central nervous system, particularly the
cerebrospinal fluid. Whether the virus is present in these body parts and for
how long varies by survivor. Scientists are now studying how long the virus
stays in these body fluids among Ebola survivors.

During an Ebola outbreak, the virus can spread quickly within healthcare
settings (such as clinics or hospitals). Clinicians and other healthcare
personnel providing care should use dedicated, preferably disposable, medical
equipment. Proper cleaning and disposal of instruments such as needles and
syringes are important. If instruments are not disposable, they must be
sterilized before using again.

Ebola virus can survive on dry surfaces, like doorknobs and countertops for
several hours; in body fluids like blood, the virus can survive up to several
days at room temperature. Cleaning and disinfection should be performed using
a hospital-grade disinfectant.

In the United States, hospital-grade disinfectant refers to U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectant pdf icon[PDF -
