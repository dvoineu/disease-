**TB Notes 4, 2019**

### Notes from the Director

Dear Colleague:

![Philip LoBue](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/Phil_1.jpg)

The end of the year marks a time to reflect on achievements, and an
opportunity to look forward to future goals. In 2019, I saw many outstanding
efforts in the service of our collective mission to prevent, control, and
eventually eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States. Thank you for
your continued commitment and all that you did this past year.

The end of 2019 was marked by significant updates and activities. In December
2019, the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) convened
in Atlanta to provide advice and recommendations regarding the elimination of
TB in the United States. The meeting included presentations from DTBE, NCHHSTP
leadership, the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Project ECHO
partners, state and local health department partners, and ACET workgroup
members.

In November 2019, CDC, in partnership with the American Thoracic
Societyexternal icon (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal
icon (IDSA), and the European Respiratory Societyexternal icon, published new
practice guidelines for the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosisexternal
icon. The new guidelines, published in the American Journal of Respiratory and
Critical Care Medicineexternal icon, provide recommendations for treating
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant
tuberculosis (XDR TB), as well as isoniazid-resistant TB.

Additionally, CDC released a new, free Continuing Education Activity from MMWR
and Medscapeexternal icon related to the updated screening, testing, and
treatment recommendations for U.S. health care personnel. This activity adds
to the many resources and tools available, including FAQs, a Baseline
Individual TB Risk Assessment formpdf icon, an infographicpdf icon, a video
summarizing the new recommendations, and a Medscape Expert Commentary
videoexternal icon featuring CDC's Dr. Sapna Bamrah Morris.

I am proud to work alongside you as we apply innovation and scientific
excellence to fulfill our mission and implement strategies for TB elimination.
Best wishes for a happy and healthy new year!

**2019 Year in Review**

This year the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) would like to
reflect on the research, resources, and events that shaped a momentous year.
Here is a look back at some TB highlights for 2019.

On March 24, 2019, DTBE recognized World TB Day, an annual event to
commemorate the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , the bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB). The
2019 World TB Day theme was "It's Time!" Activities in 2019 included the CDC
U.S. TB Elimination Champions Project, a World TB Day Social Media Photo
Challenge, the release of six short World TB Day Personal Stories videos, a
World TB Day Twitter Storm, and a World TB Day event cohosted by DTBE and the
Division of Global HIV and TB.

![2019 survey](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/survey.png)

In April, public health laboratorians attended the APHL 11th National
Conference on Laboratory Aspects of TBexternal icon and the 2019 National TB
Controllers Association (NTCA) National TB Conference held in Atlanta,
Georgia. During the conference DTBE released an addition of a new educational
module, Mycobacteriology False-Positive Case Studiesexternal icon to the
Essentials for the Mycobacteriology Laboratory Promoting Quality
Practicesexternal icon training module series. In this module, laboratorians
can navigate through five real-world cases in which a false-positive MTBC
result may have been reported.

DTBE published the 2018 surveillance report, _Reported Tuberculosis in the
United States, 2018_. This was the first edition of the annual surveillance
report published exclusively online. During 2018, the United States again
reported the lowest number of TB cases (9,025) and lowest incidence rate (2.8
cases per 100,000 persons) on record. Although TB in the United States
continues to decrease each year, the rate of decrease remains low. This low
rate of decrease is most evident among the U.S.-born population, although most
of reported TB cases continue to occur among non-U.S.-born persons.

![PITCA](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/PITCA.jpg)

In September, DTBE released the national TB program objectives and performance
targets for 2025. The national objectives include decreasing TB incidence
rates for both US-born (0.4 cases per 100,000) and non-US--born populations
(8.8 cases per 100,000), as well as for US-born minorities (1.0 case per
100,000) and children less than five years of age (0.1 cases per 100,000). The
objectives incorporate key process indicators for patient management,
laboratory reporting, contact investigations of infectious TB patients, and
follow-up examination of immigrants and refugees who recently arrived in the
United States with Class B notifications.

Additionally, in September , the Republic of Palau and Global TB Institute co-
hosted the Pacific Islands TB Controllers Association (PITCA) Conference and
TB Surveillance Training. This event assembled TB experts from throughout the
Pacific Islands and U.S. to engage in learning and discussion on the
management and control of TB and provided training and networking
opportunities for TB professionals in the region. On September 16-18, 2019,
the Republic of Palau hosted a TB Surveillance Training following the 2019
PITCA Conference.  There were 27 participants at the training, which included
representatives from five of the USAPI jurisdictions.

![New Personal
Stories](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/PersonalStories.jpg)

In October, DTBE released the personal stories of four people diagnosed and
treated for tuberculosis (TB) disease or latent TB infection. These stories
are part of DTBE's ongoing TB Personal Stories series to help raise awareness
about TB in the United States. You can view the video, print, and social media
content for each story by visiting CDC's TB Personal Stories website. DTBE
would like to thank We Are TBexternal icon, The National TB Controllers
Associationexternal icon, and the Stop TB USAexternal icon for their
contributions to this project.

DTBE was feeling like funky town this holiday season! That's because the
Communications, Education, and Behavioral Studies Branch (CEBSB) proudly
unveiled the 2019 holiday theme - Arctic Disco!

Joan Mangan, Behavioral Scientist and disco inferno mastermind, led the 2019
holiday theme and wouldn't stop 'til she got enough.  The festive scene is not
only entertaining, but educational as well - with a holiday tree adorned with
bacteria, lungs, and pill bottles.

Visitors who boogied over to the 4th floor lobby saw Dr. LoBear, the Disco
Hulk, a field dressed deer, and more. Those who weren't feeling the disco
fever were about to catch up on TB history by reading the bedazzled TB icon
ornaments.

 **New Drug-Resistant TB Treatment Guidelines**

![MDR Guidelines](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/MDR-
Guidelines.jpg)

In November 2019, DTBE released new practice guidelines for the Treatment of
Drug-Resistant Tuberculosisexternal icon. The guidelines were published in the
American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicineexternal icon and
developed by CDC, the American Thoracic Societyexternal icon (ATS), the
Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal icon (IDSA), and the European
Respiratory Societyexternal icon.

The new guidelines provide recommendations for treating multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis (MDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), as
well as isoniazid-resistant TB. The recommendations prioritize orally-
administered medications to make treatment more tolerable and improve patient
outcomes, and provide guidance on the choice and number of drugs to use during
treatment. Importantly, the recommendations address treatment of contacts to
drug-resistant TB cases to prevent future drug-resistant TB disease.
Recommendations also cover treatment length, the role of surgery, practices
for treating special populations, and monitoring treatment.

CDC offers resources to help raise awareness of drug-resistant TB, including
personal stories of MDR TB survivors like Nauman and Tenzin, infographicspdf
icon, and the latest U.S. drug-resistant TB data.

Data Management, Statistics, and Evaluation Branch Updates

 **The National TB Program Objectives and Performance Targets for 2025**

In September 2019, the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination released the
national TB program objectives and performance targets for 2025. The national
objectives include decreasing TB incidence rates for both US-born (0.4 cases
per 100,000) and non-US--born populations (8.8 cases per 100,000), as well as
for US-born minorities (1.0 case per 100,000) and children less than five
years of age (0.1 cases per 100,000). The objectives incorporate key process
indicators for patient management, laboratory reporting, contact
investigations of infectious TB patients, and follow-up examination of
immigrants and refugees who recently arrived in the United States with Class B
notifications. The complete list of national objectives and targets can be
found via https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/evaluation/indicators/default.htm

Indicators for measuring progress toward reaching the national objectives were
established by the National TB Indicators Project (NTIP). Data reported to the
National TB Surveillance System on the Report of a Verified Case of
Tuberculosis (RVCT), the Aggregate Report for Program Evaluation (ARPE), and
the Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system are used in NTIP to calculate
the indicators.

The 2025 national performance targets describe the level of success achieved
by the top 10% of TB programs in the United State. To determine the targets,
we used statistical models to find trends in NTIP data from 2010 through 2018.
State and local TB programs with fewer than 150 TB cases from 2016-2018 were
excluded. For each indicator, we developed a regression model to estimate the
90th percentile for each year, then used the fitted model to estimate the 90th
percentile in the year 2025. The 90th-percentile values reflect the projected
performance of the top 10% of TB programs in the United States in 2025.

TB program officials are encouraged to work closely with CDC Project Officers
and Evaluation Consultants to conduct evaluation studies and to develop
strategies to optimize performance to meet the targets.

**Case and Cohort Reviews: What are TB programs doing and how are they doing
it?**

![DMSEB Caseand
Cohort](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/DMSEB-
CaseandCohort.jpg)

Systematic review of TB case management activities is a required component of
TB cooperative agreement funding. However, the type of review, timing of the
review and methods used can differ between TB programs. The developed a survey
to better understand how programs were meeting this requirement. The
objectives of the survey were to catalogue the different methods being used
and to gain information that would improve support for program evaluators and
others conducting the reviews.

The survey was developed and administered by the TB PEN Steering Committee. It
was distributed via SurveyMonkey to the TB PEN email listserv, which includes
over 100 recipients, in July 2019.

_Type and Frequency of Reviews_

There was a total of 29 responses from 25 different state and city TB
programs. All but one respondent reported using a systematic review process or
processes for TB case management: 24 (86%) respondents reported conducting
case reviews, 23 (82%) reported doing cohort reviews, and 5 (18%) reported
doing chart reviews. Of respondents conducting case reviews, 42% conduct them
monthly; whereas those who do cohort reviews conduct them quarterly (35%) or
twice per year (22%). Chart reviews are conducted monthly (40%) or as needed
(60%).

_Methods Used to Conduct Reviews_

Most respondents (71%) reported initiating reviews at the state level. One
respondent commented, "The cohort reviews are initiated by the state. Most of
the case reviews are initiated by the local health districts. There are
exceptions when the state identifies needs in a district and then initiates a
case review."  Most respondents who do case reviews (83%) and cohort reviews
(78%) work with the local health jurisdiction to complete the reviews; whereas
only 20% of those who do chart reviews reported including the local health
jurisdiction. For case reviews, most respondents review only current cases,
and 60% of those who do chart reviews use both current and completed cases.

_Criteria for Case Selection_

Most (79%) respondents for all review types report not using any comorbidities
or social/economic criteria for selecting patients to include in a review. Of
those who did use such criteria, respondents select patients based on HIV
status (14%), experiencing homelessness, drug use, or being a resident or
employee of a healthcare facility (11% each). Medical criteria for selecting
cases for review include genetic clustering (25%), drug resistant disease
(21%), history of prior treatment for TB or LTBI, history of treatment
noncompletion, or patient requiring therapeutic drug monitoring (18% each).

For case reviews, most respondents reported not using a defined time period to
identify cases for review. This was reversed in respondents who do cohort
reviews, with 35% using a defined time period and 4% not using a defined time
period. For chart review, 20% of respondents reported using a defined time
period compared to 40% not using a defined time period. There was no standard
definition of 'time period' for selecting cases to include in a review,
however, respondents included examples: "Cases counted within a 6-month time
frame", "Cases counted in the current calendar year", or "All cases and
suspects in their 4th month of treatment…".

_Use and Dissemination of Results from Reviews_

Most programs (64%) analyze data and information from TB reviews and share it
with local health jurisdictions. The same percentage include the information
in their annual progress reports to CDC. Only 11% reported disseminating the
information beyond the program.

_Where do We Go from Here?_

The results were presented to the TB PEN community via conference call in
October 2019. The TB PEN Steering Committee plans to reach out to programs who
expressed a need for support and guidance in conducting reviews. Additionally,
the TB PEN Steering Committee may create and lead a TB cohort review workgroup
in order to continue to elicit information from programs and create and update
review resources. TB cohort and case reviews will also be a topic during the
2020 TB ETN/PEN conference scheduled for September 20-22, 2020.

**  
Lessons Learned from TB Modeling through the NCHHSTP Epidemiologic and
Economic Modeling Agreement**

The first 5 years of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD,
and TB Prevention's epidemiologic and economic modeling cooperative agreement,
NEEMA, concluded at the end of September 2019. When asked what they learned
from their TB modeling experience, all three grantees determined based on
model results that TB elimination is a distant goal using current tools and
service provision levels; however, substantial progress can be achieved with
extensive scale-up of targeted testing and treatment (TTT) of latent TB
infection (LTBI) in non-US-born populations or with great improvements in
global TB control.

![neema logo](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/neema-
medium.jpg)

The University of California's Consortium for Applied Prevention Economics
(CAPE) highlighted model findings that California TB cases could be cut in
half by 2024 with a 4-fold increase in TTT of non-US-born residents and of
persons with medical risks for progression. In addition, they estimated that
full implementation of the US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations
or of the California TB Risk Assessment would also prevent half of projected
TB cases in California within the first 10 years (over 9,500 TB cases). Models
by each grantee showed that TTT of non-US-born persons would be most effective
in making progress towards TB elimination, but that TTT of persons with HIV
(e.g., those having the highest progression rates) would be most efficient.

Modelers from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH)
emphasized that risk populations and their demographics differ by state, as
does TB transmission and reactivation, and consequent cost effectiveness of
TTT. Harvard University's Prevention Policy Modeling Lab (PPML) remarked that
comparing TB transmission models produced by each grantee applied to
California data helped to enhance understanding of uncertainties around TB
trends and the impact of interventions. Close collaboration with DTBE and
state TB controllers was invaluable to modeling efforts, according to JHSPH.

NEEMA model results have corroborated CDC's decision to focus on TTT for TB
elimination, extended prior CDC modeling to 50 states and 20 counties, and
produced TB case and LTBI prevalence point estimates and prediction intervals
by population (including for some co-morbidities) that can assist TB programs

While models relied greatly on National TB Surveillance System (NTSS) data to
which they were calibrated, additional data to reduce uncertainties are needed
on population dynamics, LTBI prevalence and TB incidence progression rates by
population, and on costs. DTBE encourages TB programs to publish programmatic
experiences to document the impact and cost of activities. DTBE also
encourages sharing of model results, specifically those on cost-effectiveness.

A current challenge is how to implement the modeled scenarios. Other key
questions are:

Laboratory Branch Updates

 **CDC Laboratory Safety Star: Mindy Dunn, PhD, DTBE**

Mindy Dunn, PhD, DTBE safety officer, was recently recognized as the October
CDC Laboratory Safety Star for her work in developing best practices,
training, and tools for implementing and improving safety practices within
Laboratory Branch. The CDC Laboratory Safety Star is a monthly effort by the
Office of Laboratory Safety (OLSaf) within the Office of Laboratory Science
and Safety (OLSS) to recognize CDC scientists who promote laboratory safety
and best practices and whose work exemplifies the highest standards of
laboratory safety.

![Mindy Dunn](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/MindyDunn-
small.jpg)

Dunn began her position as a safety officer in DTBE in 2017. In this role,
Dunn has applied her knowledge and previous experience as a laboratorian and
leader to strengthen the safety program in DTBE. In addition to the daily
functions of a safety officer, she has developed and implemented laboratory
specific hands‐on trainings, begun and piloted a comprehensive biosafety plan
for the branch. Her nominator, Jennifer Whitmon, PhD, specifically highlighted
how Dunn "is interested in bringing creativity to safety training."

A prime example of her creativity was showcased during last year's National
Biosafety Month, when Dunn created a Mobile Safety Station to better involve
lab personnel in hands-on safety refreshers on hand washing, and proper glove
doffing. At first, she had safety games and prizes in her office and asked
people to drop by. "No one came," recalls Dunn. "So I made a cart, put all my
stuff on it…pushed it around the hall, and every time someone was in their
office, I said, 'Hey, do you want to play a safety game? I've got prizes.'"
Taking the safety refreshers directly to staff proved to be an effective way
to engage them. The mobile station was a success, and participation increased
from 10 percent to 56 percent.

She serves as the 2019 vice‐chair of the DDID Infectious Diseases Safety
Committee. Through this position, she hopes to encourage support among
officers and wants to address the topic of leadership development in safety as
well.

Her positive attitude and fun spin ideas do not make Dunn underestimate the
seriousness of safety. She recognizes its importance on both the large and
small scale. "We're working in an important field: people's health. And we
want to keep encouraging people to come into the field, but if it is unsafe,
if people end up with illness, that's going to be discouraging. So, it's
important that the field itself is seen as a safe one. Smaller picture, I care
about everyone in my laboratory. I want them to be safe, so I feel strongly
about making sure that the people that I know are safe in what they're doing."

Surveillance, Epidemiology, & Outbreak Investigations Branch Updates

 **Improving screening, testing, and treatment for Latent TB Infection (LTBI):
Closing the Gaps in the TB Prevention Cascade in Community Health Clinics
(CHCs)**

![TBESC Logo](/tb/publications/newsletters/notes/tbn_19/images/tbesc.png)

More than two-thirds of tuberculosis (TB) cases diagnosed in the United States
are among non-U.S.-born persons, and more than 90% of these TB cases are due
to reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) most likely acquired in their
countries of origin. Improved screening, testing, and curative treatment of
LTBI among high-risk populations is a critical component of the U.S. TB
elimination strategy.

The Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium (TBESC) is a partnership of
the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE), Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) with academic institutions and TB control programs in 11
states; its current focus is LTBI prevention, identification, and treatment.
To help meet CDC's TB elimination goals, TBESC initiated a study to identify
barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment at community health clinics (CHCs),
and to inform interventions to overcome them. CHCs are important partners for
TB prevention and control; they promote community engagement and reach high-
risk communities in medically underserved areas. The study, "Improving
screening, testing, and treatment for Latent TB Infection (LTBI): Closing the
Gaps in the TB Prevention Cascade in Community Health Clinics," began data
collection in November 2019.

The study will use a mixed methods approach to quantify current levels of LTBI
testing and treatment in CHCs and investigate barriers to scale-up of these
activities. Consortium members recruited 16 CHCs that serve non-U.S.--born
populations, primarily Asian and Hispanic communities. Most clinics serve as
safety net clinics for under- and uninsured individuals. Patient chart
abstractions will help identify gaps in the LTBI Care Cascade. Provider
surveys and in-depth interviews with clinic leadership, providers, and support
staff will identify barriers and facilitators for screening, testing, and
treatment. The results of this study will help guide the development and
implementation of future CHC-based interventions to address LTBI in at-risk
communities.

Clinical Research Branch Updates

 **Research Initiatives to Improve TB Prevention and Control Efforts**

The Clinical Research Branch (CRB) continues to work on several research
initiatives to improve TB prevention and control efforts. Study descriptions
and updates include the following:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Study 31:_ This is the flagship project of DTBE, and the largest active TB treatment trial conducted by CDC to date. Over 2500 participants are enrolled at 34 clinical sites in 13 countries. The study aims to evaluate if high dose (1200 mg) daily rifapentine can shorten the necessary duration of treatment to 4 months, with or without moxifloxacin (rather than ethambutol). Study 31 has been conducted in partnership with NIH's ACTG trials network, and expects to report results in late 2020. Current activities include completion of follow-up, database cleaning, collating data, preparing for primary data analysis, and designing a dissemination plan.

Currently, minimal inhibitory concentrations for all study isolates are being determined at CDC.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * _Study 35:_ This is a pediatric study, for children ages 0-12. Recently there has been a global effort to scale-up use of pediatric preventive therapy, with a special emphasis on 3HP and related short-course rifapentine-based regimens. Study 35 is CDC's first collaboration in the development of a novel TB drug formulation for young children and aims to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of new water-dispersible formulations of isoniazid and rifapentine, allowing development of dosing guidelines for children of all ages. The study is being conducted entirely in South Africa. One site has begun enrolling, and two other sites will begin in early 2020.
