## Summary

Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the
body. Most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. If the vein
swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can
break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung, called a pulmonary
embolism.

Sitting still for a long time can make you more likely to get a DVT. Some
medicines and disorders that increase your risk for blood clots can also lead
to DVTs. Common symptoms are

    * Warmth and tenderness over the vein 
    * Pain or swelling in the part of the body affected 
    * Skin redness 

Treatment includes medicines to ease pain and inflammation, break up clots and
keep new clots from forming. Keeping the affected area raised and applying
moist heat can also help. If you are taking a long car or plane trip, take a
break, walk or stretch your legs and drink plenty of liquids.
