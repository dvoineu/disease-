About 1 out of every 3 people in the United States will develop shingles, also
known as herpes zoster, in their lifetime. An estimated 1 million people get
shingles each year in this country. If you've ever had chickenpox, you can get
shingles. Even children can get shingles. Your risk of shingles increases as
you get older.

What causes shingles?

Shingles is caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes
chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus stays dormant
(inactive) in the body. This virus can reactivate years later, causing
shingles.

Shingles Vaccines

![Vaccination.](/shingles/images/vaccination.jpg)

Two shingles vaccines are licensed in the United States, and recommended to
prevent shingles.  Zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax) has been in use since
2006. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix), has been in use since 2017,
and is recommended as the preferred shingles vaccine.
