#  Tornadoes

## Summary

Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms. They are rotating, funnel-shaped
clouds that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground. Their whirling winds can
reach 300 miles per hour. They can strike quickly with little or no warning,
devastate a neighborhood in seconds, and leave a path of damage over a mile
wide and 50 miles long. Tornadoes can also accompany tropical storms and
hurricanes as they move onto land.

Although there are no guarantees of safety during a tornado, you can take
actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared
can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it
is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.
