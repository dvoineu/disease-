# CDC _Science Clips: Volume 12, Issue 10_ , March 24, 2020

Science Clips is produced weekly to enhance awareness of emerging scientific
knowledge for the public health community. Each article features an Altmetric
Attention scoreexternal icon to track social and mainstream media mentions!

This week Science Clips is pleased to feature articles on the topic of
p-Values.

The American Statistical Association released a statement on p-Values and
statistical inference in 2016, catalyzing conversations about statistical
applications and literacy throughout the scientific community. In March 2019,
_The American Statistician_  released a special issue containing an
introductory editorial that expanded from the 2016 statement and provided more
specific guidance for using p-Values and "statistical significance" in
analyses and reports. Following the introduction were 43 articles to offer
p-Value complements, supplements, and replacements, as well as guidance for
presenting statistical results in scientific reports.

There is no consensus in the statistical community about the best methods to
move forward, although there is consensus that it is time to reconsider
current usage of  _p_ -values in the scientific literature. This Science Clips
compilation comprises the American Statistical Association statements, select
articles from the special issue of  _The American Statistician_ , and public
health research articles that applied supplemental measures to p-Values. This
compilation does not endorse these particular methods, but rather highlights
the variety of methods for researchers to consider in order to adopt the
American Statistical Association's latest recommendations.

### The report consists of these components:

PURPOSE: Phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and especially high among users of
drug products formulated with phthalates. Some phthalates mimic estradiol and
may promote breast cancer. Existing epidemiologic studies on this topic are
small, mostly not prospective, and have given inconsistent results. We
estimated associations between longitudinal phthalate exposures and breast
cancer risk in a Danish nationwide cohort, using redeemed prescriptions for
phthalate-containing drug products to measure exposure. METHODS: We
ascertained the phthalate content of drugs marketed in Denmark using an
internal Danish Medicines Agency ingredient database. We enrolled a Danish
nationwide cohort of 1.12 million women at risk for a first cancer diagnosis
on January 1, 2005. By combining drug ingredient data with the Danish National
Prescription registry, we characterized annual, cumulative phthalate exposure
through redeemed prescriptions. We then fit multivariable Cox regression
models to estimate associations between phthalate exposures and incident
invasive breast carcinoma according to tumor estrogen receptor status.
RESULTS: Over 9.99 million woman-years of follow-up, most phthalate exposures
were not associated with breast cancer incidence. High-level dibutyl phthalate
exposure (>/= 10,000 cumulative mg) was associated with an approximately two-
fold increase in the rate of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (hazard
ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5), consistent with in vitro evidence for an
estrogenic effect of this compound. Lower levels of dibutyl phthalate exposure
were not associated with breast cancer incidence. CONCLUSION: Our results
suggest that women should avoid high-level exposure to dibutyl phthalate, such
as through long-term treatment with pharmaceuticals formulated with dibutyl
phthalate.

Researchers commonly use p-values to answer the question: How strongly does
the evidence favor the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis?
p-Values themselves do not directly answer this question and are often
misinterpreted in ways that lead to overstating the evidence against the null
hypothesis. Even in the post p<0.05 era, however, it is quite possible that
p-values will continue to be widely reported and used to assess the strength
of evidence (if for no other reason than the widespread availability and use
of statistical software that routinely produces p-values and thereby
implicitly advocates for their use). If so, the potential for
misinterpretation will persist. In this article, we recommend three practices
that would help researchers more accurately interpret p-values. Each of the
three recommended practices involves interpreting p-values in light of their
corresponding Bayes factor bound, which is the largest odds in favor of the
alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis that is consistent with
the observed data. The Bayes factor bound generally indicates that a given
p-value provides weaker evidence against the null hypothesis than typically
assumed. We therefore believe that our recommendations can guard against some
of the most harmful p-value misinterpretations. In research communities that
are deeply attached to reliance on p<0.05, our recommendations will serve as
initial steps away from this attachment. We emphasize that our recommendations
are intended merely as initial, temporary steps and that many further steps
will need to be taken to reach the ultimate destination: a holistic
interpretation of statistical evidence that fully conforms to the principles
laid out in the ASA statement on statistical significance and p-values.

Second generation p-values preserve the simplicity that has made p-values
popular while resolving critical flaws that promote misinterpretation of data,
distraction by trivial effects, and unreproducible assessments of data. The
second-generation p-value (SGPV) is an extension that formally accounts for
scientific relevance by using a composite null hypothesis that captures null
and scientifically trivial effects. Because the majority of spurious findings
are small effects that are technically nonnull but practically
indistinguishable from the null, the second-generation approach greatly
reduces the likelihood of a false discovery. SGPVs promote transparency, rigor
and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori identifying which
candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more
reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with the
candidate hypotheses or null hypotheses, or when the data are inconclusive. We
illustrate the importance of these advances using a dataset of 247,000 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e., genetic markers that are potentially
associated with prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea
(MSD) in young children in Africa. We examined factors associated with
Cryptosporidium infection in MSD cases enrolled at the rural western Kenya
Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) site from 2008-2012.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At health facility enrollment, stool samples
were tested for enteric pathogens and data on clinical, environmental, and
behavioral characteristics collected. Each child's health status was recorded
at 60-day follow-up. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Of the
1,778 children with MSD enrolled as cases in the GEMS-Kenya case-control
study, 11% had Cryptosporidium detected in stool by enzyme immunoassay; in a
genotyped subset, 81% were C. hominis. Among MSD cases, being an infant,
having mucus in stool, and having prolonged/persistent duration diarrhea were
associated with being Cryptosporidium-positive. Both boiling drinking water
and using rainwater as the main drinking water source were protective factors
for being Cryptosporidium-positive. At follow-up, Cryptosporidium-positive
cases had increased odds of being stunted (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.65,
95% CI: 1.06-2.57), underweight (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.34-3.22), or wasted
(aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.21-3.43), and had significantly larger negative changes
in height- and weight-for-age z-scores from enrollment.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Cryptosporidium contributes significantly to
diarrheal illness in young children in western Kenya. Advances in point of
care detection, prevention/control approaches, effective water treatment
technologies, and clinical management options for children with
cryptosporidiosis are needed.

When the editors of Basic and Applied Social Psychology effectively banned the
use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) from articles published in
their journal, it set off a fire-storm of discussions both supporting the
decision and defending the utility of NHST in scientific research. At the
heart of NHST is the p-value which is the probability of obtaining an effect
equal to or more extreme than the one observed in the sample data, given the
null hypothesis and other model assumptions. Although this is conceptually
different from the probability of the null hypothesis being true, given the
sample, p-values nonetheless can provide evidential information, toward making
an inference about a parameter. Applying a 10,000-case simulation described in
this article, the authors found that p-values' inferential signals to either
reject or not reject a null hypothesis about the mean (α=0.05) were consistent
for almost 70% of the cases with the parameter's true location for the
sampled-from population. Success increases if a hybrid decision criterion,
minimum effect size plus p-value (MESP), is used. Here, rejecting the null
also requires the difference of the observed statistic from the exact null to
be meaningfully large or practically significant, in the researcher's judgment
and experience. The simulation compares performances of several methods: from
p-value and/or effect size-based, to confidence-interval based, under various
conditions of true location of the mean, test power, and comparative sizes of
the meaningful distance and population variability. For any inference
procedure that outputs a binary indicator, like flagging whether a p-value is
significant, the output of one single experiment is not sufficient evidence
for a definitive conclusion. Yet, if a tool like MESP generates a relatively
reliable signal and is used knowledgeably as part of a research process, it
can provide useful information.

The present note explores sources of misplaced criticisms of P-values, such as
conflicting definitions of significance levels and P-values in authoritative
sources, and the consequent misinterpretation of P-values as error
probabilities. It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been
presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across
samples (and thus are unreliable), confound effect size with sample size, are
sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions.
These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework,
yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are
constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework.
Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant
hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are
not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on
null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p=0.05
represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily
seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p
into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) log2(p).

There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are
false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power
and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly,
the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each
scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be
true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are
smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested
relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions,
outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other
interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field
in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study
designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than
true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings
may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I
discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation
of research.

Sensitivity analysis in observational research: Introducing the e-valueexternal icon

[-]Hide Abstract

Sensitivity analysis is useful in assessing how robust an association is to
potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. This article introduces a
new measure called the "E-value," which is related to the evidence for
causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to
confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on
the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with
both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-
outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large E-value
implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain
away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured confounding
would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that
in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the
E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest
calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after
adjustments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confidence interval
closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of
the scientific community to assess evidence from observational studies would
improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.

A crisis of validity has emerged from three related crises of science, that
is, the crises of statistical significance and complete randomization, of
replication, and of reproducibility. Guinnessometrics takes commonplace
assumptions and methods of statistical science and stands them on their head,
from little p-values to unstructured Big Data. Guinnessometrics focuses
instead on the substantive significance which emerges from a small series of
independent and economical yet balanced and repeated experiments. Originally
developed and market-tested by William S. Gosset aka Student in his job as
Head Experimental Brewer at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Gosset's economic
and common sense approach to statistical inference and scientific method has
been unwisely neglected. In many areas of science and life, the 10 principles
of Guinnessometrics or G-values outlined here can help. Other things equal,
the larger the G-values, the better the science and judgment. By now a
colleague, neighbor, or YouTube junkie has probably shown you one of those
wacky psychology experiments in a video involving a gorilla, and testing the
limits of human cognition. In one video, a person wearing a gorilla suit
suddenly appears on the scene among humans, who are themselves engaged in some
ordinary, mundane activity such as passing a basketball. The funny thing is,
prankster researchers have discovered, when observers are asked to think about
the mundane activity (such as by counting the number of observed passes of a
basketball), the unexpected gorilla is frequently unseen (for discussion see
Kahneman 2011). The gorilla is invisible. People don't see it.

OBJECTIVE: To report U.S. national population-based rates and trends in
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) among
adults, in both the emergency department (ED) and inpatient setting. RESEARCH
DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 1 January 2006 through 30 September
2015 from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample and National Inpatient
Sample to characterize ED visits and inpatient admissions with DKA and HHS. We
used corresponding year cross-sectional survey data from the National Health
Interview Survey to estimate the number of adults >/=18 years with diagnosed
diabetes to calculate population-based rates for DKA and HHS in both ED and
inpatient settings. Linear trends from 2009 to 2015 were assessed using
Joinpoint software. RESULTS: In 2014, there were a total of 184,255 and 27,532
events for DKA and HHS, respectively. The majority of DKA events occurred in
young adults aged 18-44 years (61.7%) and in adults with type 1 diabetes
(70.6%), while HHS events were more prominent in middle-aged adults 45-64
years (47.5%) and in adults with type 2 diabetes (88.1%). Approximately 40% of
the hyperglycemic events were in lower-income populations. Overall, event
rates for DKA significantly increased from 2009 to 2015 in both ED (annual
percentage change [APC] 13.5%) and inpatient settings (APC 8.3%). A similar
trend was seen for HHS (APC 16.5% in ED and 6.3% in inpatient). The increase
was in all age groups and in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Causes of
increased rates of hyperglycemic events are unknown. More detailed data are
needed to investigate the etiology and determine prevention strategies.

PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease affects 25-50% of patients with spina bifida.
Guidelines recommend kidney function surveillance in these patients, but
practice patterns are unknown. Variations in kidney function surveillance were
assessed across patients with spina bifida, with the hypothesis that the
treating clinic and spina bifida type would be associated with kidney function
surveillance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was
conducted from 2013-2018 within the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry in
the United States. Follow-up was anchored at the 2013 visit. Participants with
either an outcome event within 2 years of follow-up or >2 years of follow-up
without an outcome event were included. Primary outcome was kidney function
surveillance, defined as at least one renal ultrasound and serum creatinine
within 2 years of follow-up. Primary exposures were clinic and spina bifida
type, which were analyzed with covariates including sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics in logistic regression models for their association
with the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different kidney
function surveillance definitions. RESULTS: Of 8351 total patients, 5445 were
included, with median 3.0 years' follow-up. Across 23 treating clinics, kidney
function surveillance rates averaged 62% (range 6-100%). In multivariable
models, kidney function surveillance was associated with clinic, younger age,
functional lesion level, non-ambulatory status, and prior bladder
augmentation. Treating clinic remained a significant predictor of kidney
function surveillance in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
National Spina Bifida Patient Registry, wide variation exists in practice of
kidney function surveillance across treating clinics, despite adjustment for
key patient characteristics.

The beach environment creates many barriers to effective sun protection,
putting beachgoers at risk for sunburn, a well-established risk factor for
skin cancer. Our objective was to estimate incidence of sunburn among
beachgoers and evaluate the relationship between sunburn incidence and sun-
protective behaviors. A secondary analysis, of prospective cohorts at 12
locations within the U.S. from 2003 to 2009 (n=75,614), were pooled to
evaluate sunburn incidence 10-12days after the beach visit. Behavioral and
environmental conditions were cross-tabulated with sunburn incidence.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between
new sunburn and sun-protective behaviors. Overall, 13.1% of beachgoers
reported sunburn. Those aged 13-18years (16.5%), whites (16.0%), and those at
beach locations along the Eastern Seaboard (16.1%), had the highest incidence
of sunburn. For those spending >/=5h in the sun, the use of multiple types of
sun protection reduced odds of sunburn by 55% relative to those who used no
sun protection (Odds Ratio=0.45 (95% Confidence Interval:0.27-0.77)) after
adjusting for skin type, age, and race. Acute health effects of sunburn tend
to be mild and self-limiting, but potential long-term health consequences are
more serious and costly. Efforts to encourage and support proper sun-
protective behaviors, and increase access to shade, protective clothing, and
sunscreen, can help prevent sunburn and reduce skin cancer risk among
beachgoers.

BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American
Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American
Association of Central Cancer Registries collaborate to provide annual updates
on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States and to address a special
topic of interest. Part I of this report focuses on national cancer
statistics, and part 2 characterizes progress in achieving select Healthy
People 2020 cancer objectives. METHODS: For this report, the authors selected
objectives-including death rates, cancer screening, and major risk factors-
related to 4 common cancers (lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate).
Baseline values, recent values, and the percentage change from baseline to
recent values were examined overall and by select sociodemographic
characteristics. Data from national surveillance systems were obtained from
the Healthy People 2020 website. RESULTS: Targets for death rates were met
overall and in most sociodemographic groups, but not among males, blacks, or
individuals in rural areas, although these groups did experience larger
decreases in rates compared with other groups. During 2007 through 2017,
cancer death rates decreased 15% overall, ranging from -4% (rural) to -22%
(metropolitan). Targets for breast and colorectal cancer screening were not
yet met overall or in any sociodemographic groups except those with the
highest educational attainment, whereas lung cancer screening was generally
low (<10%). Targets were not yet met overall for cigarette smoking, recent
smoking cessation, excessive alcohol use, or obesity but were met for
secondhand smoke exposure and physical activity. Some sociodemographic groups
did not meet targets or had less improvement than others toward reaching
objectives. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring trends in cancer risk factors, screening
test use, and mortality can help assess the progress made toward decreasing
the cancer burden in the United States. Although many interventions to reduce
cancer risk factors and promote healthy behaviors are proven to work, they may
not be equitably applied or work well in every community. Implementing cancer
prevention and control interventions that are sustainable, focused, and
culturally appropriate may boost success in communities with the greatest
need, ensuring that all Americans can access a path to long, healthy, cancer-
free lives.

[-]Hide Abstract

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States of cancers that affect both men and women. Despite
strong evidence that screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality, CRC
screening prevalence is below the national target. This report describes
current CRC screening prevalence by age, various demographic factors, and
state. METHODS: Data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
survey were analyzed to estimate the percentages of adults aged 50-75 years
who reported CRC screening consistent with the United States Preventive
Services Task Force recommendation. RESULTS: In 2018, 68.8% of adults were up
to date with CRC screening. The percentage up to date was 79.2% among
respondents aged 65-75 years and 63.3% among those aged 50-64 years. CRC
screening prevalence was lowest among persons aged 50-54 years (50.0%) and
increased with age. Among respondents aged 50-64 years, CRC screening
prevalence was lowest among persons without health insurance (32.6%) and
highest among those with reported annual household income of >/=$75,000
(70.8%). Among respondents aged 65-75 years, CRC screening prevalence was
lowest among those without a regular health care provider (45.6%), and highest
among those with reported annual household income >/=$75,000 (87.1%). Among
states, CRC screening prevalence was highest in Massachusetts (76.5%) and
lowest in Wyoming (57.8%). DISCUSSION: CRC screening prevalence is lower among
adults aged 50-64 years, although most reported having a health care provider
and health insurance. Concerted efforts are needed to inform persons aged <50

Background: The first HPV vaccines licensed targeted two HPV types responsible
for most cervical cancers. A 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV), targeting 5 additional
types, was introduced in 2016 and is currently the only HPV vaccine available
in the United States. Previous studies demonstrated high rates of HPV
infection in Alaska Native (AN) women. We sought to measure prevalence of high
risk HPV types in AN women undergoing colposcopy and to determine those
preventable by vaccination. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, we
recruited women who were undergoing colposcopy for clinical indications at
Alaska Native Medical Center to obtain cervical brush biopsy samples.
Specimens were shipped to Atlanta, Georgia for DNA extraction, HPV detection,
and typing using L1 PCR with type-specific hybridization to detect 37 HPV
types. Results: Four hundred eighty eight specimens from 489 women were
tested. At least one HPV type was found in 458 (94%) specimens. Of 458
participants who were HPV positive, 332 (72%) had two or more types. At least
one type targeted by 9vHPV was detected in 95% of participants with CIN 3
(21/22), 82% with CIN 2 (37/45), and 65% with CIN 1 (119/184). (p < 0.001) HPV
16 or 18 were detected in 77% (17/22) with CIN 3, 53% (24/45) with CIN 2, and
36% (67/184) with CIN 1. (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of
AN women attending colposcopy clinic had evidence of HPV 16/18 infection, as
well as other high risk types targeted by 9vHPV. At least one 9vHPV type was
detected in 62% of the participants overall, and 95% of participants with
CIN3. AN women are expected to benefit from vaccination against HPV 16/18, and
will have greater benefit from 9vHPV. Information from this study could be
used to develop public health strategies to increase vaccine uptake, or to
track HPV genotype prevalence over time.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine frequent mental distress
(FMD) by demographics, chronic conditions, and health risk factors among
Illinois adults. DESIGN: Descriptive analyses included chi(2) and pairwise t
tests to examine how FMD status differed by selected characteristics and Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis to examine the association between
FMD and chronic conditions and risk factors. SETTING: Illinois Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System, 2011 to 2017 (n = 37 312). PARTICIPANTS: Adults
who self-report FMD (n = 3455) were included. MEASURES: Prevalence of high
blood pressure, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
arthritis, asthma, high blood cholesterol, cancer, kidney disease, stroke,
diabetes, weight status, physical activity status, smoking status, and
drinking status. RESULTS: A significantly higher FMD prevalence was found
among females (11.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.1-12.4), non-Hispanic
blacks (13.4, 95% CI: 11.9-15.0), adults with less than a high school degree
(14.4%; 95% CI: 12.6-16.3), adults with an annual income of less than $15 000
(21.4%; 95% CI: 19.4-23.5), and adults with a disability (23.3%, 95% CI:
21.9-24.7). Adjusted prevalence of FMD was significantly higher among adults
for 8 of 10 chronic conditions and 4 of 5 health risk factors studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Social stigmas related to depression and anxiety may lead to the
underreporting of FMD. Chronic disease management programs in Illinois should
consider integrating mental health services.

Importance: Timely eye care can prevent unnecessary vision loss. Objectives:
To estimate the number of US adults 18 years or older at high risk for vision
loss in 2017 and to evaluate use of eye care services in 2017 compared with
2002. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the
2002 (n = 30920) and 2017 (n = 32886) National Health Interview Survey, an
annual, cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of US
noninstitutionalized civilians. Analysis excluded respondents younger than 18
years and those who were blind or unable to see. Covariates included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, marital status, educational level, income-to-poverty ratio,
health insurance status, diabetes diagnosis, vision or eye problems, and US
region of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three self-reported measures
were visiting an eye care professional in the past 12 months, receiving a
dilated eye examination in the past 12 months, and needing but being unable to
afford eyeglasses in the past 12 months. Adults at high risk for vision loss
included those who were 65 years or older, self-reported a diabetes diagnosis,
or had vision or eye problems. Multivariable logistic regression models
incorporating sampling weights were used to investigate associations between
measures and covariates. Temporal comparisons between 2002 and 2017 were
derived from estimates standardized to the US 2010 census population. Results:
Among 30 920 individuals in 2002, 16.0% were 65 years or older, and 52.0% were
female; among 32 886 individuals in 2017, 20.0% were 65 years or older, and
51.8% were female. In 2017, more than 93 million US adults (37.9%; 95% CI,
37.0%-38.7%) were at high risk for vision loss compared with almost 65 million
(31.5%; 95% CI, 30.7%-32.3%) in 2002, a difference of 6.4 (95% CI, 5.2-7.6)
percentage points. Use of eye care services improved (56.9% [95% CI,
55.7%-58.7%] reported visiting an eye care professional annually, and 59.8%
[95% CI, 58.6%-61.0%] reported receiving a dilated eye examination), but 8.7%
(95% CI, 8.0%-9.5%) said they could not afford eyeglasses (compared with 51.1%
[95% CI, 49.9%-52.3%], 52.4% [95% CI, 51.2%-53.6%], and 8.3% [95% CI,
7.7%-8.9%], respectively, in 2002). In 2017, individuals with lower income
compared with high income were more likely to report eyeglasses as
unaffordable (13.6% [95% CI, 11.6%-15.9%] compared with 5.7% [95% CI,
4.9%-6.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with data from 2002, more US
adults were at high risk for vision loss in 2017. Although more adults used
eye care, a larger proportion reported eyeglasses as unaffordable. Focusing
resources on populations at high risk for vision loss, increasing awareness of
the importance of eye care, and making eyeglasses more affordable could
promote eye health, preserve vision, and reduce disparities.

BACKGROUND: Understanding hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission among people
who inject drugs (PWID) is essential for HCV elimination. We aimed to
differentiate reinfections from treatment failures and to identify
transmission linkages and associated factors in a cohort of PWID receiving
opioid agonist therapy (OAT). METHODS: We analyzed baseline and follow-up
specimens from 150 PWID from three OAT clinics in the Bronx, NY. NGS data from
the hypervariable region 1 of HCV were analyzed using Global Hepatitis
Outbreak and Surveillance Technology. RESULTS: There were three transmission
linkages between study participants. Nine participants did not achieve
sustained virologic response (SVR): seven had follow-up specimens with similar
sequences to baseline and two passed away. Four additional participants
achieved SVR but became viremic at later follow-up: two were reinfected with
different strains, one had a late treatment failure, and one was transiently
viremic 17 months post-treatment. All transmission linkages were from the same
OAT clinic and involved spousal or common-law partnerships. CONCLUSION: This
study highlights the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) as an important
tool for identifying viral transmission and to help distinguish relapse and
reinfection among PWID. Results reinforce the need for harm reduction
interventions among couples and those who report ongoing risk factors
following SVR.

Health navigation is increasingly being used to support people living with
HIV, but timely monitoring of navigation is challenging due to the burden of
reporting a high volume of diverse activities. We designed a mobile
application (app) for navigators to report their interactions with men who
have sex with men living with HIV (n = 374), including: (1) mode of support;
(2) content; and (3) duration. We assessed sociodemographic and behavioral
characteristics of the study sample and calculated monitoring system
indicators. We also conducted qualitative interviews with navigators (n = 7)
and used thematic analysis to assess app acceptability and usability. From
January 2017 to June 2018, 95.3% of participants interacted with their
navigator at least one time and 4281 reports were recorded by nine navigators.
The median number of interactions per participant was 10 (range: 1-46). The
majority of interactions (71.6%) occurred remotely. Most frequently covered
topics included: appointment reminders (36.9%), employment (19.9%), and family
(15.5%). Navigators indicated that the system was easy to use, but some did
not use it in real time as intended. Timely access to navigator data enabled
feedback and continuous training. These data can also facilitate analysis of
intensity and content of interactions to improve tailoring and sustainability.

HIV clinical outcomes have not been fully assessed by place of birth at the
national level. We analyzed the Medical Monitoring Project data, an annual
cross-sectional survey designed to produce nationally representative estimates
on adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States, collected during 2015-2017
(n = 7617). We compared sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical outcomes by
place of birth using Rao-Scott chi-square tests (P < .05). Overall, 13.6% of
adults with diagnosed HIV were non-US-born. During the past 12 months, a
higher percentage of non-US-born than US-born adults, respectively, were
prescribed ART (89.4% vs. 84.1%), retained in care (87.1% vs. 80.0%), virally
suppressed at the last test (77.2% vs. 70.9%), and had sustained viral
suppression (70.9% vs. 63.3%). A lower percentage of non-US-born adults
reported binge drinking (13.0% vs. 16.1%), using non-injection drugs (15.3%
vs. 31.7%), and suffering from depression (15.9% vs. 23.3%) or anxiety (10.0%
vs. 20.2%). A significantly higher percentage of non-US-born adults had Ryan
White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) coverage (54.4% vs. 43.1%) and attended a
RWHAP-funded health care facility (73.9% vs. 66.6%). Factors contributing to
better HIV clinical outcomes among non-US-born persons may include access to
RWHAP coverage, lower levels of substance use, and better mental health.

BACKGROUND: National chlamydia case rate trends are difficult to interpret due
to biases from partial screening coverage, imperfect diagnostic tests, and
under-reporting. We examined the extent to which these time-varying biases
could influence reported annual chlamydia case rates. METHODS: Annual reported
case rates among women aged 15 through 24 years from 2000 through 2017 were
obtained from the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD,
and TB Prevention AtlasPlus tool. Estimates of reporting completeness,
diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity, and screening coverage were
derived from literature review and expert opinion. We adjusted annual reported
case rates for incomplete reporting, imperfect diagnostic tests, and partial
screening coverage through a series of corrections, and calculated annual
adjusted case rates of correctly diagnosed chlamydia. RESULTS: Adjusted
chlamydia case rates among young women were higher than reported case rates
throughout the study period. Reported case rates increased over the study
period, but adjusted rates declined from 12,900 to 7,900 cases per 100,000
person-years between 2000 and 2007. After 2007, adjusted case rates declined
to 7,500 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2017. Bias from partial screening
coverage had a larger impact on case rate magnitude and trend shape than bias
from imperfect diagnostic tests or under-reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Reported
chlamydia case rates may be substantially lower than true chlamydia case rates
due to incomplete reporting, imperfect diagnostic tests, and partial screening
coverage. Because the magnitude of these biases has declined over time, the
differences between reported and adjusted case rates has narrowed, revealing a
sharp decline in adjusted case rates even as reported case rates have risen.
The decline in adjusted case rates suggests that the rise in reported case
rates should not be interpreted strictly as increasing chlamydia incidence, as
the observed rise can be explained by improvements in screening coverage,
diagnostic tests, and reporting.

BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to determine the frequency
and patterns of HIV drug resistance-associated mutations among children under
18 months of age born to HIV-1-positive mothers enrolled in the prevention of
mother-to-child transmission services in Haiti. METHODS: Between January 1,
2013 and December 31, 2014, HIV-positive remnant dried blood spots collected
from children under 18 months of age for Early Infant Diagnosis at the
National Public Health Laboratory were used for HIV-1 genotyping. HIV drug
resistance mutations were analyzed using the Stanford Drug Resistance HIVdb
program. RESULTS: Of the 3555 dried blood spots collected for Early Infant
Diagnosis, 360 (10.1%) were HIV-positive and 355 were available for
genotyping. Of these, 304 (85.6%) were successfully genotyped and 217 (71.4%)
had >/=1 drug resistance mutation. Mutations conferring resistance to
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs were present
in 40.5% (123) and 69.1% (210), respectively. The most frequent mutations were
K103N/S (48.0%), M184V (37.5%), G190A/S (15.1%), and Y181C/G/V (14.1%).
Predicted drug resistance analysis revealed that 68.8% of the children had
high-level resistance to non-NRTIs and 11.5% had intermediate to high-level
resistance to abacavir. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed high rates of
resistance to NRTIs and non-NRTIs among newly HIV-diagnosed children in Haiti,
suggesting that in the era of "Option B+" (initiation of lifelong combination
antiretroviral therapy to pregnant women with HIV), the majority of children
who acquire HIV infection through mother-to-child transmission of HIV have
resistant HIV. These results have led the National HIV Program to revise the
pediatric guidelines to include protease inhibitors in first-line regimens for
all HIV-positive newborns.

INTRODUCTION: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States (US) are
disproportionately affected by HIV. We estimated the impact of past
interventions and contribution of different population groups to incident MSM
HIV infections. SETTING: Baltimore, US METHODS:: We used a deterministic
model, parameterised and calibrated to demographic and epidemic Baltimore MSM
data, to estimate the fraction of HIV infections among MSM averted by condoms
and antiretroviral therapy (ART) over 1984-2017 and the fraction of infections
acquired and transmission contributed by MSM from different demographic groups
and disease and care continuum stages over 10-year periods from 1988 to 2017,
using population attributable fractions (PAFs). RESULTS: Condom use and ART
averted 19% (95% uncertainty interval: 14-25%) and 23% (15-31%) of HIV
infections that would have occurred since 1984 and 1996, respectively. Over
2008-2017, 46% (41-52%) of incident infections were acquired by, and 35%
(27-49%) of transmissions contributed by MSM aged 18-24 years old (who
constitute 27% of all MSM, 19% of HIV+ MSM). MSM with undiagnosed HIV
infection, those with diagnosed infection but not in care, and those on ART
contributed to 41% (31-54%), 46% (25-56%), and 14% (7-28%) of transmissions,
respectively. CONCLUSION: Condoms and ART have modestly impacted the HIV
epidemic among Baltimore MSM to date. Interventions reaching MSM with
diagnosed infection who are not in care should be implemented since the
largest percentage of HIV transmissions among Baltimore MSM are attributed to
this group.

BACKGROUND: Expedited partner therapy (EPT) is commonly provided by
prescription, however, the efficacy of this modality is unknown. We examined
whether EPT prescriptions are filled when the cost barrier is removed.
METHODS: To track EPT prescription fill rates, we used single-use pharmacy
vouchers that covered the cost of azithromycin, 1-gram (chlamydia treatment).
We recruited clinical sites to distribute vouchers to patients with chlamydia
who would receive an EPT prescription under clinic policies. When distributing
vouchers, sites recorded and retained: voucher unique identifier, sex and age
of index patient, distribution date, and whether partner name was written on
the EPT prescription. Pharmacists receiving vouchers entered the identifier,
sex and age of presenting person, and redemption date into a standard pharmacy
claim transmission system. Data for redeemed vouchers were retrieved from an
industry portal and linked with data retained at clinical sites. RESULTS:
Thirty-two clinical sites distributed 931 vouchers during 9/2017-01/2019; 382
(41%) were redeemed. Vouchers distributed to patients </=18 years (49/163;
30%) were less likely to be redeemed compared to those distributed to patients
>18 years (322/736; 44%; p=0.001). Just over half of vouchers were redeemed
the same day (195/351; 56%) and </=1 mile from the clinical site (188/349;
54%). After excluding an outlier site, vouchers accompanied by EPT
prescriptions including a partner name (15/27; 56%) were more likely to be
redeemed than those lacking a name (83/244; 34%; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Less
than half of EPT prescriptions were filled, even when medication was free.
Whenever possible, EPT should be provided as drug-in-hand.

BACKGROUND: With increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in
the United States, there is a critical need to educate health professionals on
the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of STIs. The National STD Curriculum
(NSTDC, https://www.std.uw.edu) is a free, online curriculum, funded by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The purpose of this paper is
to evaluate the reach, utilization, and engagement of users with the
curriculum. METHODS: Data on NSTDC utilization was collected for 24 months
after the February 1, 2017 launch. For all users, Google Analytics was used to
determine total number of users, geographic location, age and sex, and average
session duration. For registered users, additional data analysis included
work-role, demographics, and completion of self-study modules, check-on-
learning questions, and question banks. User satisfaction was measured on a
5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: During the evaluation period, 136,270
individual users accessed the NSTDC, including 24,652 registered users. Among
all registered users, 10,660 (43.2%) were registered nurses, 2,810 (11.4%)
physicians, 4,942 (20.1%) Advanced Practice Nurses and Physician Assistants,
and 6,213 (25.2%) non-clinicians. Among registered users, 18,533 (75.2%)
completed at least 1 module, 7,898 (32.0%) completed all 7 modules, and 19,804
(80.4%) answered optional check-on-learning questions. Median satisfaction
with the content was (5) Very Satisfied (IQR 4-5). CONCLUSIONS: The NSTDC is a
free, guideline-based, online curriculum with novel dual-functionality that
has achieved extensive reach with a broad array of health professionals who
engage deeply with the material. The wide usage of NSTDC demonstrates the need
for high-quality, unbiased, free content in user-focused formats.

[-]Hide Abstract

Background and Objectives: Vector-borne bacterial diseases represent a
substantial public health burden and rodents have been recognized as important
reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens. This study investigates bacterial
pathogens in a small mammal community of the southwestern United States of
America. Methods: A total of 473 samples from 13 wild rodent and 1 lagomorph
species were tested for pathogens of public health significance: Bartonella,
Brucella, Yersinia, Borrelia, Rickettsia spp., and Anaplasma phagocytophilum.
Results: Three animals were positive for Yersinia pestis, and one Sylvilagus
audubonii had a novel Borrelia sp. of the relapsing fever group. No Brucella,
Rickettsia, or A. phagocytophilum infections were detected. Bartonella
prevalence ranged between 0% and 87.5% by animal species, with 74.3% in the
predominant Neotoma micropus and 78% in the second most abundant N. albigula.
The mean duration of Bartonella bacteremia in mark-recaptured N. micropus and
N. albigula was 4.4 months, ranging from <1 to 18 months, and differed among
Bartonella genogroups. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bartonella citrate
synthase gene (gltA) revealed 9 genogroups and 13 subgroups. Seven genogroups
clustered with known or previously reported Bartonella species and strains
while two were distant enough to represent new Bartonella species. We report,
for the first time, the detection of Bartonella alsatica in North America in
Sylvilagus audubonii and expand the known host range of Bartonella washoensis
to include Otospermophilus variegatus. Interpretation and Conclusion: This
work broadens our knowledge of the hosts and geographic range of bacterial
pathogens that could guide future surveillance efforts and improves our
understanding of the dynamics of Bartonella infection in wild small mammals.

[-]Hide Abstract

BACKGROUND: Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent bacterium
closely related to Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax. The
latter has a worldwide distribution and usually causes infectious disease in
mammals associated with savanna ecosystems. Bcbva was identified in humid
tropical forests of Cote d'Ivoire in 2001. Here, we characterize the potential
geographic distributions of Bcbva in West Africa and B. anthracis in sub-
Saharan Africa using an ecological niche modeling approach.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Georeferenced occurrence data for B. anthracis
and Bcbva were obtained from public data repositories and the scientific
literature. Combinations of temperature, humidity, vegetation greenness, and
soils values served as environmental variables in model calibrations. To
predict the potential distribution of suitable environments for each pathogen
across the study region, parameter values derived from the median of 10
replicates of the best-performing model for each pathogen were used. We found
suitable environments predicted for B. anthracis across areas of confirmed and
suspected anthrax activity in sub-Saharan Africa, including an east-west
corridor from Ethiopia to Sierra Leone in the Sahel region and multiple areas
in eastern, central, and southern Africa. The study area for Bcbva was
restricted to West and Central Africa to reflect areas that have likely been
accessible to Bcbva by dispersal. Model predicted values indicated potential
suitable environments within humid forested environments. Background
similarity tests in geographic space indicated statistical support to reject
the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with
B. anthracis to those of Bcbva and when comparing humidity values and soils
values individually. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of similarity
when comparing environments associated with Bcbva to those of B. anthracis,
suggesting that additional investigation is needed to provide a more robust
characterization of the Bcbva niche. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study
represents the first time that the environmental and geographic distribution
of Bcbva has been mapped. We document likely differences in ecological niche-
and consequently in geographic distribution-between Bcbva and typical B.
anthracis, and areas of possible co-occurrence between the two. We provide
information crucial to guiding and improving monitoring efforts focused on
these pathogens.

Three siblings with inhalational elemental mercury toxicity presented with
fever, rash, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. The patients were heavily
exposed to elemental mercury that was spilled in their home and then vacuumed.
Initial whole blood mercury levels were elevated at >200 microg/L, 153
microg/L and 130 microg/L (Mayo Clinic Laboratories lab reference range <9
microg/L) for Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All three required chelation
with succimer. Clinically significant elemental mercury toxicity can resemble
an infectious illness. Severe morbidity and mortality can be prevented if
heavy metal poisoning is considered early, through a detailed history
including an environmental exposure history. For elemental mercury spills in
the home, safe and effective clean-up steps are needed. Improved public health

Isoprene is the 2-methyl analog of 1,3-butadiene and is a possible human
carcinogen (IARC Group 2B). We assessed isoprene exposure in the general US
population by measuring its urinary metabolite,
N-acetyl-S-(4-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-buten-1-yl)-l-cysteine (IPM3) in participants
(>/=3 year old) from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. Spot urine samples were analyzed for IPM3 using ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry. Exclusive tobacco smokers were distinguished from non-users
using a combination of self-reporting and serum cotinine data. IPM3 was
detected in 80.2% of samples. The median IPM3 level was higher for exclusive
cigarette smokers (39.8 mug/g creatinine) than for non-users (3.05 mug/g
creatinine). Sample weighted regression analysis, controlling for creatinine,
sex, age, race, body mass index, and diet, showed that IPM3 was positively and
significantly associated with serum cotinine. Smoking 1-10 cigarettes per day
(CPD, 0.5 pack) was significantly associated with an IPM3 increase of 596% (p
< .0001), and smoking >20 CPD (>1 pack) was significantly associated with an
IPM3 increase of 1640% (p < .0001), controlling for confounding variables.
Drinking beer/ale at median and 90th percentile levels (compared to zero
consumption) was associated (p < 0.05) with 0 and 2.9% increase in IPM3 in
non-users, respectively. We conclude that tobacco smoke is a major source of
isoprene exposure in the US population. This study provides important public
health biomonitoring data on isoprene exposure in the general US population.

[-]Hide Abstract

Steep delay discounting is characterized by a preference for small immediate
outcomes relative to larger delayed outcomes and is predictive of drug abuse,
risky sexual behaviors, and other maladaptive behaviors. Nancy M. Petry was a
pioneer in delay discounting research who demonstrated that people discount
delayed monetary gains less steeply than they discount substances with abuse
liability. Subsequent research found steep discounting for not only drugs, but
other nonmonetary outcomes such as food, sex, and health. In this systematic
review, we evaluate the hypotheses proposed to explain differences in
discounting as a function of the type of outcome and explore the trait- and
state-like nature of delay discounting. We found overwhelming evidence for the
state-like quality of delay discounting: Consistent with Petry and others'
work, nonmonetary outcomes are discounted more steeply than monetary outcomes.
We propose two hypotheses that together may account for this effect:
Decreasing Future Preference and Decreasing Future Worth. We also found clear
evidence that delay discounting has trait-like qualities: People who steeply
discount monetary outcomes steeply discount nonmonetary outcomes as well. The
implication is that changing delay discounting for one outcome could change
discounting for other outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The economic cost of breast cancer is a major personal and public
health problem in the United States. This study aims to evaluate the
insurance, employment, and financial experiences of young female breast cancer
survivors and to assess factors associated with financial decline. METHODS: We
recruited 830 women under 40 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer between
January 2013 and December 2014. The study population was identified through
California, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina population-based cancer
registries. The cross-sectional survey was fielded in 2017 and included
questions on demographics, insurance, employment, out-of-pocket costs, and
financial well-being. We present descriptive statistics and multivariate
analysis to assess factors associated with financial decline. RESULTS:
Although 92.5% of the respondents were continuously insured over the past 12
months, 9.5% paid a "higher price than expected" for coverage. Common concerns
among the 73.4% of respondents who were employed at diagnosis included
increased paid (55.1%) or unpaid (47.3%) time off, suffering job performance
(23.2%), and staying at (30.2%) or avoiding changing (23.5%) jobs for health
insurance purposes. Overall, 47.0% experienced financial decline due to
treatment-related costs. Patients with some college education, multiple
comorbidities, late stage diagnoses, and self-funded insurance were most
vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: The breast cancer diagnosis created financial
hardship for half the respondents and led to myriad challenges in maintaining
employment. Employment decisions were heavily influenced by the need to
maintain health insurance coverage. IMPACT: This study finds that a breast
cancer diagnosis in young women can result in employment disruption and
financial decline.

[-]Hide Abstract

Since implementation of Standard Precautions* for the prevention of bloodborne
pathogen transmission in 1985, health care-associated transmission of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States has been rare (1). In
October 2017, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(NYCDOHMH) and the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) were notified
by a clinician of a diagnosis of acute HIV infection in a young adult male
(patient A) without recognized risk factors (i.e., he was monogamous, had an
HIV-negative partner, and had no injection drug use) who had recently been
hospitalized for a chronic medical condition. The low risk coupled with the
recent hospitalization and medical procedures prompted NYSDOH, NYCDOHMH, and
CDC to investigate this case as possible health care-associated transmission
of HIV. Among persons with known HIV infection who had hospitalization dates
overlapping those of patient A, one person (patient B) had an HIV strain
highly similar to patient A's strain by nucleotide sequence analysis. The
sequence relatedness, combined with other investigation findings, indicated a
likely health care-associated transmission. Nucleotide sequence analysis,
which is increasingly used for detecting HIV clusters (i.e., persons with
closely related HIV strains) and to inform public health response (2,3), might
also be used to identify possible health care-associated transmission of HIV
to someone with health care exposure and no known HIV risk factors (4).

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Compared with conventional (rope-ladder cannulation
[RLC]) methods, use of buttonhole cannulation (BHC) to access arteriovenous
fistulas (AVFs) may be associated with increased risk for bloodstream
infection and other vascular access-related infection. We used national
surveillance data to evaluate the infection burden and risk among in-center
hemodialysis patients with AVFs using BHC. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive analysis
of infections and related events and retrospective observational cohort study
using National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance data. SETTING &
PARTICIPANTS: US patients receiving hemodialysis treated in outpatient
dialysis centers. PREDICTORS: AVF cannulation methods, dialysis facility
characteristics, and infection control practices. OUTCOMES: Access-related
bloodstream infection; local access-site infection; intravenous (IV)
antimicrobial start. ANALYTIC APPROACH: Description of frequency and rate of
infections; adjusted relative risk (aRR) for infection with BHC versus RLC
estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: During 2013 to 2014, there were
2,466 access-related bloodstream infections, 3,169 local access-site
infections, and 13,726 IV antimicrobial starts among patients accessed using
BHC. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen, present in half (52%)
of the BHC access-related bloodstream infections. Hospitalization was frequent
among BHC access-related bloodstream infections (37%). In 2014, 9% (n=271,980)
of all AVF patient-months reported to NHSN were associated with BHC. After
adjusting for facility characteristics and practices, BHC was associated with
significantly higher risk for access-related bloodstream infection (aRR, 2.6;
95% CI, 2.4-2.8) and local access-site infection (aRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.6)
than RLC, but was not associated with increased risk for IV antimicrobial
start. LIMITATIONS: Data for facility practices were self-reported and not
patient specific. CONCLUSIONS: BHC was associated with higher risk for
vascular access-related infection than RLC among in-center hemodialysis
patients. Decisions regarding the use of BHC in dialysis centers should take
into account the higher risk for infection. Studies are needed to evaluate
infection control measures that may reduce infections related to BHC.

BACKGROUND: Serious transfusion-associated adverse events are rare in the
United States. To enhance blood safety, various measures have been developed.
With use of data from the 2017 National Blood Collection and Utilization
Survey (NBCUS), we describe the rate of transfusion-associated adverse events
and the implementation of specific blood safety measures. STUDY DESIGN AND
METHODS: Data from the 2017 NBCUS were used with comparison to already
published estimates from 2015. Survey weighting and imputation were used to
obtain national estimates of transfusion-associated adverse events, and the
number of units treated with pathogen reduction technology (PRT), screened for
Babesia, and leukoreduced. RESULTS: The rate of transfusion-associated adverse
events requiring any diagnostic or therapeutic interventions was stable (275
reactions per 100,000 transfusions in 2015 and 282 reactions per 100,000
transfusions in 2017). In 2017 among US blood collection centers, 16 of 141
(11.3%) reported screening units for Babesia and 28 of 144 (19.4%) reported
PRT implementation; 138 of 2279 (6.1%) hospitals reported transfusing PRT-
treated platelets. In 2017, 134 of 2336 (5.7%) hospitals reported performing
secondary bacterial testing of platelets (50,922 culture-based and 63,220
rapid immunoassay tests); in 2015, 71 of 1877 (3.8%) hospitals performed
secondary testing (87,155 culture-based and 21,779 rapid immunoassay tests).
Nearly all whole blood/red blood cell units and platelet units were
leukoreduced. CONCLUSIONS: Besides leukoreduction, implementation of most
blood safety measures reported in this study remains low. Nationally,
hospitals might be shifting from culture-based secondary bacterial testing to
rapid immunoassays.

Mathematical modeling of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and multidrug
resistant organisms (MDROs) improves our understanding of pathogens
transmission dynamics and provides a framework for evaluating prevention
strategies. One way of improving the communication among modelers is by
providing a standardized way of describing and reporting models thereby
instilling confidence in the reproducibility and generalizability of such
models. We updated the Overview, Design concepts, and Details protocol
developed by Grimm et al. for describing agent-based models (ABMs) to better
align with elements commonly included in healthcare-related ABMs. The MInD-
Healthcare framework includes the following nine key elements: 1. Purpose and
scope; 2. Entities, state variables, and scales; 3. Initialization; 4. Process
overview and scheduling; 5. Input data; 6. Agent interactions and organism
transmission; 7. Stochasticity; 8. Submodels; 9. Model verification,
calibration, and validation. Our objective is that this framework will improve
the quality of evidence generated utilizing these models.

BACKGROUND: Licensed inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) are recommended for
persons aged >/=65 years, including trivalent high-dose IIV (HD-IIV3) and
adjuvanted IIV (aIIV3); both are manufactured in eggs. Quadrivalent
recombinant vaccine (RIV4) is produced without eggs. We conducted an
exploratory study to compare immunogenicity of HD-IIV3, aIIV3 and RIV4 against
cell-grown vaccine and circulating A(H3N2) viruses in 2017-18. METHODS:
Eighty-nine adults aged 65-74 years participating in a 2-year, open-label
immunogenicity trial (ClinicalTrails.gov: NCT02872311) were randomized 1:1:1
to receive HD-IIV3, aIIV3, or RIV4 after receipt of standard dose IIV3 in
2016-17. Serum was obtained at baseline and day 28 post vaccination.
Microneutralization titers were determined using four cell-propagated A(H3N2)
viruses: 2017-18 vaccine strain (clade 3C.2a), circulating viruses from clades
3C.2a1 and 3C.2a2, and 'antigenically advanced' clade 3C.3a (2019-20 vaccine
strain). Active surveillance was conducted to identify influenza illnesses.
RESULTS: Post vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) against the vaccine
strain was <1:60 in each group and <15% seroconverted. RIV4 generated a
greater fold-rise (2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.5) compared to HD-IIV3 (1.6, 95% CI
1.3-1.8). RIV4 generated higher post vaccination titers against 3C.2a1 and
3C.2a2 viruses, and the mean fold-rise after RIV4 was twice as high (3.3 and
3.5, respectively) relative to HD-IIV3 (1.4 and 1.6) and aIIV3 (1.7 and 1.6).
Against the antigenically advanced 3C.3a virus, RIV4 generated a greater mean
fold-rise (2.9, 95% CI 2.0-4.3) vs HD-IIV3 (1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) and aIIV3
(1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.1). Postvaccination titers against 3C.2a2 were >/=1:40 in 5
of 7 participants with PCR-confirmed A(H3N2) infection during the ensuing
influenza season. CONCLUSION: High-dose, adjuvanted, and recombinant vaccines
generated suboptimal neutralizing antibody responses to the cell-grown vaccine
strain, but RIV4 generated a greater cross-protective response against
circulating and antigenically advanced viruses. Recombinant technology may
contribute to more broadly protective influenza vaccines, and comparative
effectiveness studies are needed.

Introduction: When Viet Nam launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization in
1981, it covered six vaccines, including measles. Subsequently, Viet Nam
experienced a marked reduction in measles infections. A nationwide measles
epidemic occurred in April 2014 and an investigation found that 86% of
affected children aged 9 months to 10 years were not fully vaccinated;
therefore, understanding the reasons for not vaccinating could improve
vaccination coverage. Method: We performed a cross-sectional study to
determine vaccination coverage and reasons for non-vaccination among children
aged 9 months to 10 years in six districts in Ho Chi Minh City with the
highest number of measles cases in 2014. Measles vaccination status of the
youngest child in each household was determined and reasons for non-
vaccination were investigated. A chi(2) test and multiple logistic regression
were used to identify independent predictors of full vaccination. Results: In
total, 207 children were enrolled during the study period in 2014. Full
measles vaccination coverage was 55% in these households, and 73% of parents
were aware of the importance of measles vaccination to protect their children.
We found that the father's education level (under high school versus high
school and above) and the site where the survey was conducted were
significantly associated with vaccination status. Conclusion: The vaccination
coverage was lower than the coverage reported by district preventive medicine
centres of the seven study wards. Lack of the second vaccination was a key
obstacle to eliminating the vaccination gap. A catch-up mass vaccination
campaign or health promotion of measles vaccination directed towards parents
should be considered to improve vaccination coverage.

Importance: Because rotavirus infection is a hypothesized risk factor for type
1 diabetes, live attenuated rotavirus vaccination could increase or decrease
the risk of type 1 diabetes in children. Objective: To examine whether there
is an association between rotavirus vaccination and incidence of type 1
diabetes in children aged 8 months to 11 years. Design, Setting, and
Participants: A retrospective cohort study of 386937 children born between
January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014, was conducted in 7 US health care
organizations of the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Eligible children were followed
up until a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, disenrollment, or December 31, 2017.
Exposures: Rotavirus vaccination for children aged 2 to 8 months. Three
exposure groups were created. The first group included children who received
all recommended doses of rotavirus vaccine by 8 months of age (fully exposed
to rotavirus vaccination). The second group had received some, but not all,
recommended rotavirus vaccines (partially exposed to rotavirus vaccination).
The third group did not receive any doses of rotavirus vaccines (unexposed to
rotavirus vaccination). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of type 1
diabetes among children aged 8 months to 11 years. Type 1 diabetes was
identified by International Classification of Diseases codes: 250.x1, 250.x3,
or E10.xx in the outpatient setting. Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to analyze time to type 1 diabetes incidence from 8 months to
11 years. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were calculated. Models were adjusted for
sex, race/ethnicity, birth year, mother's age, birth weight, gestational age,
number of well-child visits, and Vaccine Safety Datalink site. Results: In a
cohort of 386937 children (51.1% boys and 41.9% non-Hispanic white), 360169
(93.1%) were fully exposed to rotavirus vaccination, 15 765 (4.1%) were
partially exposed to rotavirus vaccination, and 11 003 (2.8%) were unexposed
to rotavirus vaccination. Children were followed up a median of 5.4 years
(interquartile range, 3.8-7.8 years). The total person-time follow-up in the
cohort was 2253879 years. There were 464 cases of type 1 diabetes in the
cohort, with an incidence rate of 20.6 cases per 100000 person-years. Compared
with children unexposed to rotavirus vaccination, the adjusted hazard ratio
was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.62-1.72) for children fully exposed to rotavirus
vaccination and 1.50 (95% CI, 0.81-2.77) for children partially exposed to
rotavirus vaccination. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study
suggest that rotavirus vaccination does not appear to be associated with type
1 diabetes in children.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus of clinical
significance in both livestock and humans. A formalin-inactivated virus
preparation was initially developed for human use and tested in laboratory
workers in the 1960s. Vaccination resulted in generation of neutralizing
antibody titers in most recipients, but neutralization titers waned over time,
necessitating frequent booster doses. In this study, T cell-based immune
responses to the formalin-inactivated vaccine were examined in a cohort of
seven individuals who received between 1 and 6 doses of the vaccine. RVFV-
specific T cell responses were detectable up to 24 years post vaccination.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from this cohort of individuals were used
to map out the viral epitopes targeted by T cells in humans. These data
provide tools for assessing human RVFV-specific T cell responses and are thus
a valuable resource for future human RVFV vaccine efforts.

Historic observations suggest that survivors of smallpox maintained lifelong
immunity and protection to subsequent infection compared to vaccinated
individuals. Although protective immunity by vaccination using a related virus
(vaccinia virus (VACV) strains) was the key for smallpox eradication, it does
not uniformly provide long term, or lifelong protective immunity (Heiner et
al., 1971). To determine differences in humoral immune responses, mice were
inoculated with VACV either systemically, using intranasal inoculation (IN),
or locally by an intradermal (ID) route. We hypothesized that sub-lethal IN
infections may mimic systemic or naturally occurring infection and lead to an
immunodominance reaction, in contrast to localized ID immunization. The
results demonstrated systemic immunization through an IN route led to enhanced
adaptive immunity to VACV-expressed protein targets both in magnitude and in
diversity when compared to an ID route using a VACV protein microarray. In
addition, cytokine responses, assessed using a Luminex(R) mouse cytokine
multiplex kit, following IN infection was greater than that stemming from ID
infection. Overall, the results suggest that the route of immunization (or
infection) influences antibody responses. The greater magnitude and diversity
of response in systemic infection provides indirect evidence for anecdotal
observations made during the smallpox era that survivors maintain lifelong
protection. These findings also suggest that systemic or disseminated host
immune induction may result in a superior response, that may influence the
magnitude of, as well as duration of protective responses.

girls, and/or young children (both sexes). METHODS: We reviewed 5 studies that
used infectious disease modeling to assess the potential impact of vaccination
for preventing congenital CMV infection. All models assumed CMV vaccination
would prevent primary infection and 2 models also assumed prevention of
reinfections and reactivations. RESULTS: Despite differences in structure,
assumptions, and population data, infant vaccination (both sexes) was the
optimal strategy in all models, but in 1 model vaccinating seronegative women
at 19-21 years of age was also optimal (for duration of vaccine protection
>/=8 years). In 3 models, infant vaccination increased average age at primary
infection as a result of decreased secondary transmission (herd immunity)
combined with waning vaccine-induced immunity. This effect could increase the
risk of congenital CMV infections in populations where primary CMV infection
occurs early in childhood but could be minimized by administering a second
dose of vaccine during adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding vaccine
efficacy and duration of immunity, and how these might vary depending on CMV
serostatus and age at vaccination, will be key to defining CMV vaccination
strategies.

Prediction skill is a key test of models for epidemic dynamics. However,
future validation of models against out-of-sample data is rare, partly because
of a lack of timely surveillance data. We address this gap by analyzing the
response of rotavirus dynamics to infant vaccination. Syndromic surveillance
of emergency department visits for diarrhea in New York City reveals a marked
decline in diarrheal incidence among infants and young children, in line with
data on rotavirus-coded hospitalizations and laboratory-confirmed cases, and a
shift from annual to biennial epidemics increasingly affecting older children
and adults. A published mechanistic model qualitatively predicted these
patterns more than 2 years in advance. Future efforts to increase vaccination
coverage may disrupt these patterns and lead to further declines in the
incidence of rotavirus-attributable gastroenteritis.

BACKGROUND: Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but
the risk of outbreaks owing to international importations remains. An outbreak
of measles in New York City began when one unvaccinated child returned home
from Israel with measles; onset of rash occurred on September 30, 2018, 9 days
after the child returned home. METHODS: We investigated suspected cases of
measles by conducting interviews, reviewing medical and immunization records,
identifying exposed persons, and performing diagnostic testing. Measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine (given as either MMR or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella
vaccine and collectively referred to as MMR vaccine) uptake was monitored with
the use of the Citywide Immunization Registry. The total direct cost to the
New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was calculated. RESULTS:
A total of 649 cases of measles were confirmed, with onsets of rash occurring
between September 30, 2018, and July 15, 2019. A majority of the patients
(93.4%) were part of the Orthodox Jewish community, and 473 of the patients
(72.9%) resided in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, New York. The median age
was 3 years; 81.2% of the patients were 18 years of age or younger, and 85.8%
of the patients with a known vaccination history were unvaccinated. Serious
complications included pneumonia (in 37 patients [5.7%]) and hospitalization
(in 49 patients [7.6%]); among the patients who were hospitalized, 20 (40.8%)
were admitted to an intensive care unit. As a result of efforts to promote
vaccination, the percentage of children in Williamsburg who received at least
one dose of MMR vaccine increased from 79.5% to 91.1% among children 12 to 59
months of age. As of September 9, 2019, a total of 559 staff members at the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (7% of the agency) had been involved
in the measles response. The cost of the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene response was $8.4 million. CONCLUSIONS: Importation of measles and
vaccination delays among young children led to an outbreak of measles in New
York City. The outbreak response was resource intensive and caused serious
illness, particularly among unvaccinated children.

INTRODUCTION: Exposure to violence victimization may help explain disparities
of substance use among gender-nonconforming youth (i.e., those whose gender
expression differs from societal expectations). METHODS: In 2015, three large
urban school districts (2 in California and 1 in Florida) conducted a Youth
Risk Behavior Survey that included the assessment of gender expression among a
racially/ethnically diverse population-based sample of 6,082 high school
students. Five categories of violence victimization were assessed (felt unsafe
at school, threatened or injured with a weapon at school, bullied at school,
electronically bullied, and forced sexual intercourse). In 2019, the effect of
violence victimization on substance use disparities was examined by
calculating sex-stratified prevalence ratios by gender nonconformity, adjusted
for sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and grade (adjusted prevalence ratio 1
[APR1]), and comparing these with prevalence ratios adjusted for those
variables plus violence victimization (adjusted prevalence ratio 2 [APR2]).
RESULTS: Among female students, only being threatened or injured with a weapon
was significantly (p<0.05) associated with gender nonconformity and there were
no substance use disparities by gender nonconformity. Among male students,
every category of violence victimization was more prevalent among gender-
nonconforming than among gender-conforming students and most substance use
categories demonstrated significant gender nonconformity disparities. After
controlling for violence victimization, these disparities decreased but
remained statistically significant for the use of cocaine (APR1=2.84 vs
APR2=1.99), methamphetamine (APR1=4.47 vs APR2=2.86), heroin (APR1=4.55 vs
APR2=2.96), and injection drug use (APR1=7.90 vs APR2=4.72). CONCLUSIONS:
School-based substance use prevention programs may benefit from strategies
that support gender diversity and reduce violence victimizations experienced
by gender-nonconforming students, by providing a safe and supportive school
environment.

One in 10 U.S. residents aged >/=18 years reports falling each year (1). Among
all age groups, falls can cause serious injury and are the second leading
cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related deaths (2). TBI is a head injury
caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body or a penetrating head
injury that results in disruption of normal brain function.* CDC estimated
national and state-specific rates and trends for TBI-related deaths (TBI
deaths) caused by unintentional falls (fall-related TBI deaths) among U.S.
residents during 2008-2017, by selected decedent characteristics. The national
age-adjusted rate of fall-related TBI deaths increased by 17% from 2008 to
2017. Rate trends at the national level increased significantly for nearly all
decedent characteristics, with the most notable increases observed among
persons living in noncore (i.e., most rural), nonmetropolitan counties and
those aged >/=75 years. Analysis of state-specific rate trends determined that
rates of fall-related TBI deaths increased significantly in 29 states over the
10-year study period. A fall can happen to anyone of any age, but falls are
preventable. Health care providers and the public need to be aware of
evidence-based strategies to prevent falls, given that rates of fall-related
TBI deaths are increasing. Health care providers can educate patients on fall
and TBI prevention, assess their risk for falls, and when needed, encourage
participation in appropriate evidence-based fall prevention programs.(dagger).

From July 2009 to June 2018, the rates of multiple-victim, school-associated
homicides in the United States fluctuated substantially, with evidence of a
significant increase in recent years (1). Data on the effects of such
incidents on students' school attendance and perceptions of safety and
connectedness are limited (2,3) but important. This study used data from a
neighboring within-district school before and after a multiple-fatality
shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on
February 14, 2018. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by one
group of students on February 14 just before the shooting (575) and another
group during February 15-21 (502); demographics for these groups appeared
similar. Linear and logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic
characteristics explored differences between groups for safety-related
perceptions or experiences, school connectedness, and absenteeism. Compared
with students surveyed before the shooting, students surveyed in the days
immediately following the shooting had lower odds of feeling safe at school,
higher odds of absenteeism, and higher school connectedness scores. Findings
suggest the shooting had an immediate, sizeable effect on safety perceptions
and absenteeism among students in a neighboring school. Findings also suggest
higher school connectedness following the shooting. Further study of school

This study examined national trends in self-directed violence in the context
of changes in opioid use and depression to better inform prevention measures.
Using 2000-2015 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, we identified 625,064
hospitalizations for self-directed violence among persons aged >/=10years in
the United States. Based on whether co-listing opioid related diagnosis and
depression, we categorized hospitalizations for self-directed violence into
four comorbid categories as 1) related to opioids alone; 2) related to
depression alone; 3) related to both opioids and depression; and 4) related to
neither opioids nor depression. Census population estimates served as the
denominator for calculating hospitalization rates for self-directed violence.
Hospitalization rates for self-directed violence related to opioids doubled
from 5.1 per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 11.0 in 2015. The rate of increase was
highest for self-directed violence related to both opioids and depression,
which increased 9.4% annually during 2000-2011 and then decreased 4.3%
annually during 2011-2015. Hospitalizations for self-directed violence related
to depression alone remained the predominant category, accounting for
approximately 60% of hospitalizations for self-directed violence; the rates
among females aged 10-24years were the highest among all subgroups, and rose
7.8% annually since 2011 reaching 93.2 per 100,000 persons in 2015\. These
findings highlight the importance of assessing the risk for self-directed
violence among patients misusing opioids and the importance of treating opioid
use disorder and depression, particularly when they co-occur. Prevention and
treatment of depression is especially important for young females.

Larval mosquitoes are aquatic omnivorous scavengers which scrape food from
submerged surfaces and collect suspended food particles with their mouth
brushes. The composition of diets that have been used in insectaries varies
widely though necessarily provides sufficient nutrition to allow colonies to
be maintained. Issues such as cost, availability and experience influence
which diet is selected. One component of larval diets, essential fatty acids,
appears to be necessary for normal flight though deficiencies may not be
evident in laboratory cages and are likely more important when mosquitoes are
reared for release into the field in e.g. mark-release-recapture and genetic
control activities. In this study, four diets were compared for rearing
Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, all of which provide these essential
fatty acids. Two diets were custom formulations specifically designed for
mosquitoes (Damiens) and two were commercially available fish foods: Doctors
Foster and Smith Koi Staple Diet and TetraMin Plus Flakes. Development rate,
survival, dry weight and adult longevity of mosquitoes reared with these four
diets were measured. The method of presentation of one diet, Koi pellets, was
additionally fed in two forms, pellets or a slurry, to determine any effect of
food presentation on survival and development rate. While various criteria
might be selected to choose 'the best' food, the readily-available Koi pellets
resulted in development rates and adult longevity equal to the other diets,
high survival to the adult stage and, additionally, this is available at low
cost.

[-]Hide Abstract

The neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A and B viruses plays a distinct role in
viral replication and has a highly conserved catalytic site. Numerous sialic
(neuraminic) acid analogs that competitively bind to the NA active site and
potently inhibit enzyme activity have been synthesized and tested. Four NA
inhibitors are now licensed in various parts of the world (zanamivir,
oseltamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) to treat influenza A and B
infections. NA changes, naturally occurring or acquired under selective
pressure, have been shown to reduce drug binding, thereby affecting the
effectiveness of NA inhibitors. Drug resistance and other drawbacks have
prompted the search for the next-generation NA-targeting therapeutics. One of
the promising approaches is the identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
targeting the conserved NA epitopes. Anti-NA mAbs demonstrate Fab-based
antiviral activity supplemented with Fc-mediated immune effector functions.
Antiviral Fc-conjugates offer another cutting-edge strategy that is based on a
multimodal mechanism of action. These novel antiviral agents are composed of a
small-molecule NA inhibitor and an Fc-region that simultaneously engages the
immune system. The significant advancements made in recent years further
support the value of NA as an attractive target for the antiviral development.

Between 25% and 30% of the nearly one million military personnel who
participated in the 1991 Persian Gulf War became ill with chronic symptoms
ranging from gastrointestinal to nervous system dysfunction. This disorder is
now referred to as Gulf War Illness (GWI) and the underlying pathophysiology
has been linked to exposure-based neuroinflammation caused by
organophosphorous (OP) compounds coupled with high circulating
glucocorticoids. In a mouse model of GWI we developed, corticosterone was
shown to act synergistically with an OP (diisopropylflurophosphate) to
dramatically increase proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the brain.
Because not all Gulf War participants became sick, the question arises as to
whether differential genetic constitution might underlie individual
differences in susceptibility. To address this question of genetic liability,
we tested the impact of OP and glucocorticoid exposure in a genetic reference
population of 30 inbred mouse strains. We also studied both sexes. The results
showed wide differences among strains and overall that females were less
sensitive to the combined treatment than males. Furthermore, we identified one
OP-glucocorticoid locus and nominated a candidate gene-Spon1-that may underlie
the marked differences in response.

Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic pathogen sensor that is
crucial against a number of viral infections. Many viruses have evolved to
inhibit pathogen sensors to suppress host innate immune responses. In the case
of influenza, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) suppresses RIG-I function, leading
to viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. We show that silencing NS1

(shRNA) (5'-PPP-NS1shRNA), designed using the conserved region of a number of
influenza viruses, not only prevented NS1 expression but also induced RIG-I
activation and type I interferon (IFN) expression, resulting in an antiviral
state leading to inhibition of influenza virus replication in vitro. In
addition, administration of 5'-PPP-NS1shRNA in prophylactic and therapeutic
settings resulted in significant inhibition of viral replication following
viral challenge in vivo in mice with corresponding increases of RIG-I, IFN-
beta, and IFN-lambda, as well as a decrease in NS1 expression.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are among the most common
complications arising in transplant patients, elevating the risk of various
complications including loss of graft and death. HCMV infections are also
responsible for more congenital infections worldwide than any other agent.
Congenital HCMV (cCMV) infections are the leading nongenetic cause of
sensorineural hearing loss and a source of significant neurological
disabilities in children. While there is overlap in the clinical and
laboratory approaches to diagnosis of HCMV infections in these settings, the
management, follow-up, treatment, and diagnostic strategies differ
considerably. As yet, no country has implemented a universal screening program
for cCMV. Here, we summarize the issues, limitations, and application of
diagnostic strategies for transplant recipients and congenital infection,
including examples of screening programs for congenital HCMV that have been
implemented at several centers in Japan, Italy, and the United States.

INTRODUCTION: This report provides supplemental results from the 2017 National
Blood Collection and Utilization Survey on characteristics of the donor
population, autologous and directed donations and transfusions, platelets,
plasma and granulocyte transfusions, pediatric transfusions, severe donor-
related adverse events, cost of blood units, hospitals policies and practices,
and inventory, dosing, and supply. METHODS: Weighting and imputation were used
to generate national estimates including number of donors, donations, donor
deferrals, autologous and directed donations and transfusions, severe donor-
related adverse events, platelet and plasma collections and transfusions,
number of cross-match procedures, irradiation and leukoreduction, and
pediatric transfusions. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017, successful donations
decreased slightly by 2.1% with a 10.3% decrease in donations by persons aged
16-18 years and a 14.4% increase in donations by donors aged >65 years. The
median price paid for blood components by hospitals decreased from $211 to
$207 for leukoreduced red blood cell units, from $523 to $517 for leukoreduced
apheresis platelet units, and from $54 to $51 for fresh frozen plasma units.
Plasma transfusions decreased 13.6%, but group AB plasma units transfused
increased 24.7%. CONCLUSION: Between 2015 and 2017, blood donations declined
slightly because of decreases in donations from younger donors, but the number
of donations from older donors increased. The price hospitals pay for blood
has continued to decrease. Plasma transfusions have decreased, but the
proportion of plasma transfusions involving group AB plasma have increased.

We used cross-sectional data from the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status
Survey to evaluate factors associated with anaemia among a nationally
representative sample of nonpregnant women 15- 49 years (n = 1, 918).
Haemoglobin, biomarkers of iron status and other micronutrients, infection,
inflammation, and blood disorders were assessed from venous blood. Soil-
transmitted helminth and Helicobacter pylori infections were assessed from
stool. Sociodemographic, household, and health characteristics and diet were
ascertained by interview. We conducted bivariate analyses between candidate
predictors and anaemia (haemoglobin <12.0 g/ dL, altitude- and smoking-
adjusted). Candidate predictors that were significant in bivariate models (P <
0.05) were included in the multivariable logistic regression model, accounting
for complex sampling design. Anaemia prevalence was 20.2% (95% confidence
interval [CI] [17.6, 22.8]). Associated with reduced anaemia odds were living
in the Mountain and Hill ecological zones relative to the Terai (adjusted odds
ratio [AOR] 0.35, 95% CI [0.21, 0.60] and AOR 0.41, 95% CI [0.29, 0.59],
respectively), recent cough (AOR 0.56, 95% CI [0.38, 0.82]), hormonal
contraceptive use (AOR 0.58; 95% CI [0.38, 0.88]), ln ferritin (micrograms per
litre; AOR 0.43, 95% CI [0.35, 0.54]), and ln retinol binding protein
(micrograms per litre; AOR 0.20, 95% CI [0.11, 0.37]). Residing in a house
with an earth floor (AOR 1.74, 95% CI [1.18, 2.56]), glucose-6- phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency (AOR 2.44, 95% CI [1.66, 3.60]), and
haemoglobinopathies (AOR 6.15, 95% CI [3.09, 12.26]) were associated with
increased anaemia odds. Interventions that improve micronutrient status,
ensure access to hormonal birth control, and replace dirt floors to reduce
infection risk might help reduce anaemia in this population.

[-]Hide Abstract

Background: Some of the recently piloted innovative approaches for the
management of acute malnutrition in children use the "expanded MUAC-only"
approach, with Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) < 125 mm as the sole
anthropometric criterion for screening and admission, classification of cases
as severe using the 115 mm cut-off, and use Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food
(RUTF) for the management of both moderate (MAM) and severe (SAM) cases of
acute malnutrition. Our study aimed at exploring the potential consequences of
this "expanded MUAC-only" program scenario on the eligibility for treatment
and RUTF allocation, as compared with the existing WHO normative guidance.
Methods: We analyzed data from 550 population representative cross-sectional
cluster surveys conducted since 2007. We retrieved all children classified as
SAM and MAM according to currently used case definitions, and calculated the
proportions of SAM children who would be excluded from treatment,
misclassified as MAM, or whose specific risks (because of having both MUAC and
weight-for height deficits) would be ignored. We also analyzed the expected
changes in the number and demographics (sex, age) of children meant to receive
RUTF according to the new approach. Results: We found that approximately one
quarter of SAM children would not be detected and eligible for treatment under
the "expanded MUAC-only" scenario, and another 20% would be classified as MAM.
A further 17% of the total SAM children would be admitted and followed only
according to their MUAC or oedema status, while they also present with a
severe weight-for height deficit on admission. Considering MAM targeting,
about half of the MAM children would be left undetected. This scenario also
shows a 2.5 time increase in the number of children targeted with RUTF, with
approximately 70% of MAM and 30% of SAM cases among this new RUTF target.
Conclusions: This empirical evidence suggests that adoption of "expanded MUAC-
only" programs would likely lead to a priori exclusion from treatment or
misclassifying as MAM a large proportion of SAM cases, while redirecting
programmatic costs in favor of those less in need. It underscores the need to
explore other options for improving the impact of programs addressing the
needs of acutely malnourished children.

Background: Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight-for-height (WHZ) are
commonly used indicators to identify acute malnutrition. However, MUAC and WHZ
diagnose different children, and produce prevalence estimates that are
meaningfully different. Previous research in Somalia has suggested improved
concordance using MUAC-for-age (MUACZ) rather than MUAC. We further evaluate
the relationship between MUACZ, MUAC, and WHZ using surveys conducted
globally. Methods: We analyzed 882 population representative surveys from 41
countries. Children ages 6-59 months were classified as acutely malnourished
using three independent criteria: WHZ < \- 2 (WHZ2), MUAC< 125 mm (MUAC125),
MUACZ < \- 2 (MUACZ2). Population prevalence using each of the three criteria
are presented by country and region. Correlations of survey prevalence for
each indicator pair were assessed. Multivariable regression models of MUACZ
and MUAC125 adjusted for WHZ2, stunting prevalence, age, and sex. To evaluate
individual level diagnostic concordance, we compared the proportion of
children identified by each of the three criteria. Results: Median prevalence
of acute malnutrition overall was highest for MUACZ2 (14.0%) followed by WHZ2
(10.6%), and lowest for MUAC125 (7.3%). The absolute difference in prevalence
between MUACZ2 and WHZ2 was smaller than the difference between MUAC125 and
WHZ2 for 51.3% of surveys. The correlations of WHZ2 with both MUACZ2 as well
as with MUAC125 were weak, positive associations (Pearson's r = 0.5757 and
0.4943, respectively), but MUAC125 and MUACZ2 had a strong, linear
relationship (Pearson's r = 0.9265). The adjusted regression model for MUACZ2
had greater fit (R(2) = 0.50) relative to the adjusted model for MUAC125 (R(2)
= 0.43). The proportion of children identified by both MUAC125 and WHZ2 was
25.5%, smaller than the proportion identified by both MUACZ2 and WHZ2 (30.6%).
Conclusions: MUACZ identified more children as malnourished than MUAC,
resulting in a higher prevalence of acute malnutrition in nearly all settings.
Prevalence by MUACZ was not consistently more similar to WHZ than that
estimated by MUAC, and correlations with WHZ were only slightly improved
relative to MUAC. Consequently, programmatic use of MUACZ cannot be justified
based on improved concordance with WHZ. Further research on morbidity and
mortality of children with low MUACZ only are needed before recommending MUACZ
for wider use.

Firefighting is physically and mentally strenuous, requiring rapid,
appropriate decision-making in hot environments. Intact cognitive function is
imperative to firefighters' effectiveness and safety. The study purpose was to
investigate the effect of hyperthermia and the effect of body cooling on
sustained attention and response inhibition while wearing firefighters'
personal protective ensembles after exercise in a hot environment. Twelve
healthy males were recruited to participate in two randomly assigned exercise
sessions (walking on a treadmill for 40 min at 40% [Formula: see text] O2max
while wearing firefighter's protective ensemble) in a hot environment: control
(no cooling) and intervention (cooling). For intervention sessions, a cooling
garment was worn underneath firefighter's protective ensemble and infused with
18 degrees C water supplied by an external water circulator. Participants
performed a computerized Go/No-Go (a measure of cognitive function) test three
times at baseline and post-exercise for each experimental session.
Participants completed baseline testing while wearing cotton athletic
clothing. The exercise continued until the core temperature reached
approximately 39 degrees C (for all subjects regardless of cooling or non-
cooling experimental sessions). Following hyperthermia, participants'
physiological responses were significantly increased after exercise. Subjects'
reaction time was significantly reduced (improved) after experiencing thermal
strain and reaching hyperthermia. The cooling method had a significant impact
on suppressing the physiological load, i.e., body cooling delayed the time to
reach a Tc of 39 degrees C (p </= 0.05), but not cognitive inhibition and
attention (reaction time and accuracy). Unexpectedly, hyperthermia resulted in
shorter reaction time following exercise (16.64 +/- 5.62; p < 0.03), likely
influenced by increased attention/vigilance. Hyperthermia may trigger an acute
increase in alertness, causing decreased reaction time.

OBJECTIVES: Four machine manufacturing facility workers had a novel
occupational lung disease of uncertain aetiology characterised by lymphocytic
bronchiolitis, alveolar ductitis and emphysema (BADE). We aimed to evaluate
current workers' respiratory health in relation to job category and relative
exposure to endotoxin, which is aerosolised from in-use metalworking fluid.
METHODS: We offered a questionnaire and spirometry at baseline and 3.5 year
follow-up. Endotoxin exposures were quantified for 16 production and non-
production job groups. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decline
>/=10% was considered excessive. We examined SMRs compared with US adults,
adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for health outcomes by endotoxin exposure
tertiles and predictors of excessive FEV1 decline. RESULTS: Among 388 (89%)
baseline participants, SMRs were elevated for wheeze (2.5 (95% CI 2.1 to
3.0)), but not obstruction (0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1)). Mean endotoxin exposures
(range: 0.09-28.4 EU/m(3)) were highest for machine shop jobs. Higher exposure
was associated with exertional dyspnea (aPR=2.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.7)), but not
lung function. Of 250 (64%) follow-up participants, 11 (4%) had excessive FEV1
decline (range: 403-2074 mL); 10 worked in production. Wheeze (aPR=3.6 (95% CI
1.1 to 12.1)) and medium (1.3-7.5 EU/m(3)) endotoxin exposure (aPR=10.5 (95%
CI 1.3 to 83.1)) at baseline were associated with excessive decline. One
production worker with excessive decline had BADE on subsequent lung biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung function loss and BADE were associated with production work.
Relationships with relative endotoxin exposure indicate work-related adverse
respiratory health outcomes beyond the sentinel disease cluster, including an
incident BADE case. Until causative factors and effective preventive
strategies for BADE are determined, exposure minimisation and medical
surveillance of affected workforces are recommended.

[-]Hide Abstract

Selecting a proper respirator requires determining the ratio of an employee's
maximum use concentration (MUC) divided by the occupational exposure limit of
a chemical. Current industrial hygiene practice often is to obtain a
percentile estimate (e.g. 95th) of the measured exposure distribution to apply
as the MUC. However, practitioners who are not yet familiar with statistical
or mathematical approaches may choose the highest exposure data point as the
MUC, a method that is still considered appropriate by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration. Nonetheless, choosing a respirator using the
highest exposure data point when only limited data are available may result in
not always providing the most adequate respirator. Because some practitioners
are not familiar with exposure assessment tools, our primary goal in this
study was to demonstrate the best process when selecting respiratory
protection by using a combination of exposure data and assessment tools. Three
user-friendly tools, IHDataAnalyst, Advanced REACH Tool, and IHSTAT, were
selected to demonstrate how to use different types of tool outputs when
choosing a respirator. A decision logic was developed to help users navigate
the combining of different data inputs. Personal full-shift exposure data
collected in four different workplaces were used to describe four different
outcomes generated when the maximum exposure data point and the tool's output
are compared with the exposure limit of the chemical. Outcomes varied, from
determinations of 'high confidence' (or final decision) to 'low confidence'
(or indicating more data are needed) in the selection of a respirator
recommendation. In conclusion, systematically adopting the combination of
exposure data and assessment tools could increase practitioners' confidence in
decision-making when choosing respirators from a limited exposure data set.
These suggested guidelines will lead practitioners toward good industrial
hygiene practices.

BACKGROUND: Asthma-related health outcomes are known to be associated with
indoor moisture and renovations. The objective of this study was to estimate
the frequency of these indoor environmental quality (IEQ) factors in
healthcare facilities and their association with asthma-related outcomes among
workers. METHODS: New York City healthcare workers (n = 2030) were surveyed
regarding asthma-related symptoms, and moisture and renovation factors at work
and at home during the last 12 months. Questions for workplace moisture
addressed water damage (WD), mold growth (MG), and mold odor (MO), while for
renovations they addressed painting (P), floor renovations (FR), and wall
renovations (WR). Regression models were fit to examine associations between
work and home IEQ factors and multiple asthma-related outcomes. RESULTS:
Reports of any moisture (n = 728, 36%) and renovations (n = 1412, 70%) at work
were common. Workplace risk factors for asthma-related outcomes included the
moisture categories of WD by itself, WD with MO (without MG), and WD with MG
and MO, and the renovation category with the three factors P, FR, and WR.
Reports of home IEQ factors were less frequent and less likely to be
associated with health outcomes. Data analyses suggested that MG and/or MO at
work and at home had a synergistic effect on the additive scale with a
symptom-based algorithm for bronchial hyperresponsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The
current study determined that moisture and renovation factors are common in
healthcare facilities, potentially putting workers at risk for asthma-related
outcomes. More research is needed to confirm these results, especially
prospective studies.

Researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH) developed a light-emitting diode (LED) area luminaire called the
Saturn and conducted a laboratory study using a Fletcher High Dual-boom Mast
Feed (HDDR) roof bolting machine. The Saturn luminaire was designed to (1)
enhance floor illumination to enable better detection of trip hazards in the
interior spaces of a roof bolter and (2) reduce glare that has typically been
an issue of concern on roof bolters. This paper reports on the results of
achieving the second objective. The existing roof bolter lighting was the
baseline and was compared with three versions of the Saturn luminaire relative
to light intensity (100%, 75%, and 50%). Discomfort and disability glare data
were obtained from 30 participants that comprised three age groups. Discomfort
glare perceptions were obtained using the De Boer rating scale, and disability
glare was quantified by using Mars Letter Contrast Sensitivity tests.
Discomfort glare was reduced at least 3 levels with all Saturn versions. Also,
a predictive model was used to estimate discomfort glare, and the results were
similar. Disability glare was the least for the Saturn's 50% intensity, and
all Saturn versions had significantly less disability glare than with the
baseline lighting. Veiling luminance was calculated and used as another
indicator of disability glare. Veiling luminance was 28 to 42 times greater
with the baseline lighting as compared with that of the Saturn lighting.
Lastly, visibility levels were calculated. The Saturn versions were 4 to 6.5
times better in terms of visibility level.

[-]Hide Abstract

Indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides is a major vector control
strategy for malaria prevention. We evaluated the impact of a single round of
IRS with the organophosphate, pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic 300CS), on
entomological and parasitological parameters of malaria in Migori County,
western Kenya in 2017, in an area where primary vectors are resistant to
pyrethroids but susceptible to the IRS compound. Entomological monitoring was
conducted by indoor CDC light trap, pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) and human
landing collection (HLC) before and after IRS. The residual effect of the
insecticide was assessed monthly by exposing susceptible An. gambiae s.s.
Kisumu strain to sprayed surfaces in cone assays and measuring mortality at 24
hours. Malaria case burden data were extracted from laboratory records of four
health facilities within the sprayed area and two adjacent unsprayed areas.
IRS was associated with reductions in An. funestus numbers in the intervention
areas compared to non-intervention areas by 88% with light traps (risk ratio
[RR] 0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.21, p < 0.001) and 93% with PSC collections (RR =
0.07, 0.03-0.17, p < 0.001). The corresponding reductions in the numbers of
An. arabiensis collected by PSC were 69% in the intervention compared to the
non-intervention areas (RR = 0.31, 0.14-0.68, p = 0.006), but there was no
significant difference with light traps (RR = 0.45, 0.21-0.96, p = 0.05).
Before IRS, An. funestus accounted for over 80% of Anopheles mosquitoes
collected by light trap and PSC in all sites. After IRS, An. arabiensis
accounted for 86% of Anopheles collected by PSC and 66% by CDC light trap in
the sprayed sites while the proportion in non-intervention sites remained
unchanged. No sporozoite infections were detected in intervention areas after
IRS and biting rates by An. funestus were reduced to near zero. Anopheles
funestus and An. arabiensis were fully susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl and
resistant to pyrethroids. The residual effect of Actellic 300CS lasted ten
months on mud and concrete walls. Malaria case counts among febrile patients
within IRS areas was lower post- compared to pre-IRS by 44%, 65% and 47% in
Rongo, Uriri and Nyatike health facilities respectively. A single application
of IRS with Actellic 300CS in Migori County provided ten months protection and
resulted in the near elimination of the primary malaria vector An. funestus
and a corresponding reduction of malaria case count among out-patients. The
impact was less on An. arabiensis, most likely due to their exophilic nature.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has set a goal for malaria elimination by 2030. Low
parasite density infections may go undetected by conventional diagnostic
methods (microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests) and their contribution to
malaria transmission varies by transmission settings. This study quantified
the burden of subpatent infections from samples collected from three regions
of northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Sub-samples of dried blood spots from the
Ethiopian Malaria Indicator Survey 2015 (EMIS-2015) were tested and compared
using microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and nested polymerase chain
reaction (nPCR) to determine the prevalence of subpatent infection. Paired
seroprevalence results previously reported along with gender, age, and
elevation of residence were explored as risk factors for Plasmodium infection.
RESULTS: Of the 2608 samples collected, the highest positive rate for
Plasmodium infection was found with nPCR 3.3% (95% CI 2.7-4.1) compared with
RDT 2.8% (95% CI 2.2-3.5) and microscopy 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.7). Of the nPCR
positive cases, Plasmodium falciparum accounted for 3.1% (95% CI 2.5-3.8),
Plasmodium vivax 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.7), mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax 0.1%
(95% CI 0.0-0.4), and mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium malariae 0.1% (95% CI
0.0-0.3). nPCR detected an additional 30 samples that had not been detected by
conventional methods. The majority of the nPCR positive cases (61% (53/87))
were from the Benishangul-Gumuz Region. Malaria seropositivity had significant
association with nPCR positivity [adjusted OR 10.0 (95% CI 3.2-29.4), P <
0.001]. CONCLUSION: Using nPCR the detection rate of malaria parasites
increased by nearly threefold over rates based on microscopy in samples
collected during a national cross-sectional survey in 2015 in Ethiopia. Such
subpatent infections might contribute to malaria transmission. In addition to
strengthening routine surveillance systems, malaria programmes may need to
consider low-density, subpatent infections in order to accelerate malaria
elimination efforts.

[-]Hide Abstract

BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of cyclosporiasis, a diarrheal illness caused by
Cyclospora cayetanensis, have been a public health issue in the USA since the
mid 1990's. In 2018, 2299 domestically acquired cases of cyclosporiasis were
reported in the USA as a result of multiple large outbreaks linked to
different fresh produce commodities. Outbreak investigations are hindered by
the absence of standardized molecular epidemiological tools for C.
cayetanensis. For other apicomplexan coccidian parasites, multicopy organellar
DNA such as mitochondrial genomes have been used for detection and molecular
typing. METHODS: We developed a workflow to obtain complete mitochondrial
genome sequences from cilantro samples and clinical samples for typing of C.
cayetanensis isolates. The 6.3 kb long C. cayetanensis mitochondrial genome
was amplified by PCR in four overlapping amplicons from genomic DNA extracted
from cilantro, seeded with oocysts, and from stool samples positive for C.
cayetanensis by diagnostic methods. DNA sequence libraries of pooled amplicons
were prepared and sequenced via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Sequence
reads were assembled using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. RESULTS: This
approach allowed us to sequence complete mitochondrial genomes from the
samples studied. Sequence alterations, such as single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) profiles and insertion and deletions (InDels), in mitochondrial genomes
of 24 stool samples from patients with cyclosporiasis diagnosed in 2014,
exhibited discriminatory power. The cluster dendrogram that was created based
on distance matrices of the complete mitochondrial genome sequences, indicated
distinct strain-level diversity among the 2014 C. cayetanensis outbreak
isolates analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genomic

BACKGROUND: Despite achievements in the reduction of malaria globally,
imported malaria cases to the United States by returning international
travelers continue to increase. Immigrants to the United States from sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) who then travel back to their homelands to visit friends
and relatives (VFRs) experience a disproportionate burden of malaria illness.
Various studies have explored barriers to malaria prevention among VFRs and
non-VFRs-travelers to the same destinations with other purpose for travel-but
few employed robust epidemiologic study designs or performed comparative
analyses of these two groups. To better quantify the key barriers that VFRs
face to implement effective malaria prevention measures, we conducted a
comprehensive community-based, cross-sectional, survey to identify differences
in malaria prevention knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among VFRs and
others traveling to Africa and describe the differences between VFRs and other
types of international travelers. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three distinct
populations of travelers with past or planned travel to malaria-endemic
countries of SSA were surveyed: VFRs diagnosed with malaria as reported
through a state health department; members of the general VFR population
(community); and VFR and non-VFR travelers presenting to a travel health
clinic, both before their pretravel consultation and again, after return from
travel. A Community Advisory Board of African immigrants and prior qualitative
research informed survey development and dissemination. Across the three
groups, 489 travelers completed surveys: 351 VFRs and 138 non-VFRs. VFRs who
reported taking antimalarials on their last trip rated their concern about
malaria higher than those who did not. Having taken five or more trips to SSA
was reported more commonly among VFRs diagnosed with malaria than community
VFRs (44.0% versus 20.4%; p = 0.008). Among travel health clinic patients
surveyed before and after travel, VFR travelers were less successful than non-
VFRs in adhering to their planned use of antimalarials (82.2% versus 98.7%; p
= 0.001) and employing mosquito bite avoidance techniques (e.g., using bed
nets: 56.8% versus 81.8%; p = 0.009). VFRs who visited the travel health
clinic were more likely than VFR respondents from the community to report
taking an antimalarial (83.0% versus 61.9%; p = 0.009), or to report bite
avoidance behaviors (e.g., staying indoors when mosquitoes were out: 80.9%
versus 59.5%; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: We observed heterogeneity in malaria
prevention behaviors among VFRs and between VFR and non-VFR traveler
populations. Although VFRs attending the travel health clinic appear to
demonstrate better adherence to malaria prevention measures than VFR
counterparts surveyed in the community, specialized pretravel care is not
sufficient to ensure chemoprophylaxis use and bite avoidance behaviors among
VFRs. Even when seeking specialized pretravel care, VFRs experience greater
barriers to the use of malaria prevention than non-VFRs. Addressing access to
health care and upstream barrier reduction strategies that make intended
prevention more achievable, affordable, easier, and resonant among VFRs may
improve malaria prevention intervention effectiveness.

Fellowship programs offer career development opportunities, provide
experiential training, and can be used to recruit personnel to address
specific challenges facing the public health workforce. Given the potential
influence fellowships have on the future public health workforce, it is
important to understand and articulate the results of such programs and to
identify areas of improvement to meet current workforce needs. The purpose of
this literature review was to identify common practices used to evaluate
nonclinical fellowship programs. After a search of the internet and selected
databases, we screened titles and abstracts using predetermined selection
criteria. We then conducted a detailed review of selected papers to extract
information about program characteristics (program description, sector, and
program length) and evaluation characteristics (primary evaluation type,
framework for evaluation, data collection methods, and respondent populations)
from 33 papers. We found a limited number of published papers on the
evaluation of nonclinical fellowship programs, and most focused on outcomes
associated with fellows or alumni. The most useful papers for our purposes
clearly described the evaluation framework that guided the evaluation.

OBJECTIVES: To provide updated and more detailed pooled IUD expulsion rates
and expulsion risk estimates among women with postpartum IUD placement by
timing of insertion, delivery type, and IUD type to inform current IUD
insertion practices in the United States. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed,
Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through June 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY
CRITERIA: We included all studies, of any study design, that examined
postpartum placement of Copper T380A (copper) or Levonorgestrel
(LNG)-containing IUDs that reported counts of expulsion. STUDY APPRAISAL AND
SYNTHESIS METHODS: We evaluated IUD expulsion among women receiving postpartum
IUDs in the 'immediate' (within 10 minutes), 'early inpatient' (greater than
10 minutes to less than 72 hours), 'early outpatient' (72 hours to less than 4
weeks) and interval (4 weeks or greater) time periods after delivery. We
assessed study quality using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence
grading system. We calculated pooled absolute rates of partial and complete
IUD expulsion separately and estimated adjusted relative risks by the timing
of postpartum placement, delivery type and IUD type using log-binomial
multivariable regression. RESULTS: We identified 48 level I to II-3 studies of
poor to good quality that reported a total of 7,661 IUD placements. Complete
IUD expulsion rates varied by timing of placement: 10.2% (range 0.0-26.7) for
immediate, 13.2% (3.5-46.7) for early inpatient, 0% for early outpatient, and
1.8% (0.0-4.8) for interval placements. Complete IUD expulsion rates also
varied by delivery type: 14.8% (range 4.8-43.1) for vaginal and 3.8%
(0.0-21.1) for cesarean deliveries. Among immediate postpartum vaginal
placements, the expulsion rate for LNG-IUDs was 27.4% (18.8-45.2) and 12.4%
(4.8-43.1) for copper IUDs. Compared with interval placement, immediate and
early postpartum placements (inpatient and outpatient combined) were
associated with greater risk of complete expulsions (adjusted RR (aRR), 8.33;
95% CI, 4.32-16.08 and aRR, 5.27; 95% CI, 2.56-10.85, respectively). Among
immediate postpartum placements, risk of expulsion was greater for placement
after vaginal compared with cesarean deliveries (aRR, 4.57; 95% CI,
3.49-5.99). Among immediate placements at the time of vaginal delivery, LNG-
IUDs were associated with a greater risk of expulsion compared with copper
IUDs (aRR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.36-2.65). CONCLUSION: While IUD expulsion rates
vary by timing of placement, type, and mode of delivery, IUD insertion can
take place at any time. Understanding the risk of IUD expulsion at each time
period will enable women to make an informed choice about when to initiate an

[-]Hide Abstract

Importance: Since August 2019, more than 2700 patients have been hospitalized
with e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) across
the United States. This report describes the outbreak in California, a state
with one of the highest case counts and with a legal adult-use (recreational)
cannabis market. Objective: To present clinical characteristics and vaping
product exposures of patients with EVALI in California. Design, Setting, and
Participants: Case series describing epidemiologic and laboratory data from
160 hospitalized patients with EVALI reported to the California Department of
Public Health by local health departments, who received reports from treating
clinicians, from August 7 through November 8, 2019. Exposures: Standardized
patient interviews were conducted to assess vaping products used, frequency of
use, and method of product acquisition. Vaping products provided by a subset
of patients were tested for active ingredients and other substances. Main
Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics, level of
care, and outcomes of hospitalization were obtained from medical record
review. Results: Among 160 patients with EVALI, 99 (62%) were male, and the
median age was 27 years (range, 14-70 years). Of 156 patients with data
available, 71 (46%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 46 (29%)
required mechanical ventilation. Four in-hospital deaths occurred. Of 86
patients interviewed, 71 (83%) reported vaping tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)-containing products, 36 (43%) cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products, and
39 (47%) nicotine-containing products. Sixty-five of 87 (75%) THC-containing
products were reported as obtained from informal sources, such as friends,
acquaintances, or unlicensed retailers. Of 87 vaping products tested from 24
patients, 49 (56%) contained THC. Vitamin E or vitamin E acetate was found in
41 (84%) of the THC-containing products and no nicotine products. Conclusions
and Relevance: Patients' clinical outcomes and vaping behaviors, including
predominant use of THC-containing products from informal sources, are similar
to those reported by other states, despite California's legal recreational
cannabis market. While most THC products tested contained vitamin E or vitamin
E acetate, other underlying cause(s) of injury remain possible. The California
Department of Public Health recommends that individuals refrain from using any
vaping or e-cigarette products, particularly THC-containing products from
informal sources, while this investigation is ongoing.

[-]Hide Abstract

Binge drinking* is a leading preventable public health problem. From 2006 to
2010, binge drinking contributed to approximately 49,000 annual deaths
resulting from acute conditions (e.g., injuries and violence) (1). Binge
drinking also increases the risk for adverse health conditions, including some
chronic diseases (e.g., breast cancer) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
(2). In 2004, 2013, and again in 2018, for all U.S. adults aged >/=18 years in
primary care, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended
alcohol screening and brief intervention (alcohol SBI) or counseling for
persons whose screening indicated drinking in excess of recommended limits or
in ways that increase risk for poor health outcomes (3-5). However, previous
CDC surveillance data indicate that patients report rarely talking to their
provider about alcohol use,(dagger) and alcohol SBI is traditionally delivered
through conversation. CDC recently analyzed 2017 data from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey's five-question module, which asked
adults in 13 states( section sign) and the District of Columbia (DC) about the
delivery of alcohol SBI during their most recent checkup in the past 2 years.
Overall, 81.4% of adults (age-standardized estimate) reported being asked
about alcohol use by a health professional in person or on a form during a
checkup in the past 2 years, but only 37.8% reported being asked a question
about binge-level alcohol consumption, which is included on USPSTF recommended
instruments (3). Among module respondents who were asked about alcohol use at
a checkup in the past 2 years and reported current binge drinking (past 30
days) at time of survey, only 41.7% were advised about the harms of drinking
too much at a checkup in the past 2 years, and only 20.1% were advised to
reduce or quit drinking at a checkup in the past 2 years. These findings
suggest that missed opportunities remain for health care providers to
intervene with patients who report binge drinking. Working to implement
alcohol SBI at a systems level, including the provision of the new Healthcare
Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) measure, Unhealthy Alcohol Use
Screening and Follow-Up, can improve alcohol SBI's use and benefit in primary
care.

[-]Hide Abstract

On July 10, 2019, Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) was notified
of five previously healthy adolescents with severe lung injuries who reported
use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products before symptom onset. As of December
31, 2019, 105 confirmed or probable cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product
use-associated lung injury (EVALI)* had been reported to WDHS . Three social
clusters (A, B, and C), comprising eight EVALI patients (cluster A = two
patients, cluster B = three, and cluster C = three) were identified. WDHS
investigated these clusters with standard and follow-up interviews; laboratory
analysis of e-cigarette, or vaping, products; and analysis of bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid. All eight patients reported daily use of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, product
cartridges (THC cartridges) in the month preceding symptom onset. All THC
cartridges were purchased from local illicit dealers, and all patients
reported using THC cartridges labeled as "Dank Vapes," among other illicit
brand names. At least two members of each cluster reported frequent sharing of
THC cartridges before symptom onset. All eight patients also reported daily
use of nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Vitamin E acetate
(VEA) was detected in all five THC cartridges tested from two patients, and in
BAL fluid from two other patients. These findings suggest that THC cartridges
containing VEA and sold on the illicit market were likely responsible for
these small clusters of EVALI. Based on information presented in this and
previous reports (1,2) CDC recommends not using THC-containing e-cigarette, or
vaping, products, especially those obtained from informal sources such as
friends, family, or in-person or online dealers (1). VEA is strongly linked to
the EVALI outbreak and should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products
(1).

[-]Hide Abstract

Plague, an acute zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, is endemic in the West
Nile region of northwestern Uganda and neighboring northeastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) (1-4). The illness manifests in multiple clinical
forms, including bubonic and pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is rare,
rapidly fatal, and transmissible from person to person via respiratory
droplets. On March 4, 2019, a patient with suspected pneumonic plague was
hospitalized in West Nile, Uganda, 4 days after caring for her sister, who had
come to Uganda from DRC and died shortly thereafter, and 2 days after area
officials received a message from a clinic in DRC warning of possible plague.
The West Nile-based Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) plague program,
together with local health officials, commenced a multipronged response to
suspected person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague, including contact
tracing, prophylaxis, and education. Plague was laboratory-confirmed, and no
additional transmission occurred in Uganda. This event transpired in the
context of heightened awareness of cross-border disease spread caused by
ongoing Ebola virus disease transmission in DRC, approximately 400 km to the
south. Building expertise in areas of plague endemicity can provide the rapid
detection and effective response needed to mitigate epidemic spread and
minimize mortality. Cross-border agreements can improve ability to respond
effectively.

[-]Hide Abstract

In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused
by the virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1). The disease spread widely
in China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in
36 other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-
person transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of
countries have reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20,
state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with
teams deployed from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons
considered to have had close contact(dagger) with patients with confirmed
COVID-19 (2). The aims of these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and
care of patients, limit further transmission, and better understand risk
factors for transmission.

[-]Hide Abstract

Aerial spraying of products to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes is a public
health measure used to control vector-borne diseases. In some outbreaks, the
intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study
evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think
about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In
December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX,
New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical
scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N =
20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They
were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the
environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an
authority figure genuinely working in the community's interests. They received
timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying
helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement
requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of
recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy,
transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems
with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in
governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health
authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based
ones, to communicate aerial spraying's risks and benefits.

[-]Hide Abstract

The panzootic caused by A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses has occurred in multiple waves since 1996. From
2013 onwards, clade 2.3.4.4 viruses of subtypes A(H5N2), A(H5N6), and A(H5N8)
emerged to cause panzootic waves of unprecedented magnitude among avian
species accompanied by severe losses to the poultry industry around the world.
Clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses have expanded in distinct geographical and
evolutionary pathways likely via long distance migratory bird dispersal onto
several continents and by poultry trade among neighboring countries. Coupled
with regional circulation, the viruses have evolved further by reassorting
with local viruses. As of February 2019, there have been 23 cases of humans
infected with clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 viruses, 16 (70%) of which had fatal
outcomes. To date, no HPAI A(H5) virus has caused sustainable human-to-human
transmission. However, due to the lack of population immunity in humans and
ongoing evolution of the virus, there is a continuing risk that clade 2.3.4.4
A(H5) viruses could cause an influenza pandemic if the ability to transmit
efficiently among humans was gained. Therefore, multisectoral collaborations
among the animal, environmental, and public health sectors are essential to
conduct risk assessments and develop countermeasures to prevent disease and to
control spread. In this article, we describe an assessment of the likelihood
of clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses gaining human-to-human transmissibility and
impact on human health should such human-to-human transmission occur. This
structured analysis assessed properties of the virus, attributes of the human
population, and ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in animal hosts.
