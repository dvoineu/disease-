How do they differ?**  
The main difference between a grant and cooperative agreement is the level of
NCIPC's involvement. For a grant, NCIPC is not substantially involved in the
execution of the research. For a cooperative agreement, NCIPC may have
substantial involvement. The amount of involvement by NCIPC in a cooperative
agreement will be specified in the program announcement.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. **Can I submit more than one application for the same program announcement?**  
You are encouraged to submit only one application in response to a particular
program announcement. With few exceptions (e.g., research issues needing
immediate public health attention), only one application per principal
investigator will be funded per program announcement.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. **Can I apply to more than one program announcement?**  
Yes, there are no restrictions on the number of program announcements to which
a principal investigator can apply.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. **I have other funding for part of our project/research and want to apply for NCIPC funding to extend our work. Is this ok?**  
Yes, you can apply for NCIPC to fund research that is partially funded by
another source. However, the proposed research needs to be different than that
which is already funded; NCIPC will not pay for duplicate research.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. **My application from last year was not funded; can I resubmit it this year?**  
You may resubmit your application provided the proposed research meets the
research objectives of a new program announcement. The research objectives of
the program announcements change from year to year, so it is important that
your application meets the current objectives. A resubmitted application will
not receive any special treatment. It is possible to improve your chances of
success if you consider the weaknesses and limitations addressed in your
summary statement from your peer reviewed application.

You do not need IRB approval when you submit your application. However, if you
receive an award, a portion of your funds will be restricted until all of your
IRB assurances are in place.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. **Who will review my application?**  
Your application will be evaluated first for eligibility and responsiveness by
the Office of Grants Services and NCIPC ERPO, respectively. If accepted, your
application will move to scientific and technical merit by an external peer
review panel convened by NCIPC. Applications judged to have technical and
scientific merit then undergo a secondary review for programmatic relevance to
NCIPC priorities and other considerations. The secondary review will be
conducted by the Board of Scientific Counselors or a Senior Advisory Panel in
accordance with CDC Peer Review Policy. The NCIPC Director will make final
funding decisions based on the results of the primary review, the relevance
and balance of proposed research relative to NCIPC programs and priorities,
and the avoidance of unwarranted duplication of federally funded research.

Can my research team set up a conference call with you?**  
The NCIPC ERPO routinely conducts a pre-application call for the pool of
potential applicants to hear about the intent of the NOFO and to ask any
questions prior to submitting an application. Information about the time and
date for these "pre-application calls" are included in the published NOFO.
Potential applicants can also contact the Scientific Program Official listed
in the NOFO for information.
