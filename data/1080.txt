# Registries of Programs Effective in Reducing Youth Risk Behaviors

Minus

Related Pages

Various federal agencies have identified youth-related programs that they
consider worthy of recommendation on the basis of expert opinion or a review
of design and research evidence. These programs focus on different health
topics, risk behaviors, and settings. Some, but not all, of these programs
have shown evidence in reducing youth risk behaviors.

Each agency has its own process and criteria for determining the programs that
are worthy of recommendation. Users are encouraged to review each web site to
understand the inclusion criteria the registry used.
