## Summary

The structure of your face helps protect your eyes from injury. Still,
injuries can damage your eye, sometimes severely enough that you could lose
your vision. Most eye injuries are preventable. If you play sports or work in
certain jobs, you may need protection.

The most common type of injury happens when something irritates the outer
surface of your eye. Certain jobs such as industrial jobs or hobbies such as
carpentry make this type of injury more likely. It's also more likely if you
wear contact lenses.

Chemicals or heat can burn your eyes. With chemicals, the pain may cause you
to close your eyes. This traps the irritant next to the eye and may cause more
damage. You should wash out your eye right away while you wait for medical
help.
