If at least 70% of the principals or lead health education teachers in the sample completed the survey, the data are weighted to be representative of the state, large urban school district, or territory. With weighted data, it is possible to say, for example, "X% of schools in our state offer students intramural activities or physical activity clubs."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Unweighted data represent only the schools that completed the questionnaire.

The tables [PDF - 7 pages] show the School Health Profiles participation
history for states, large urban school districts, tribal governments, and
territories, including the status of the data (weighted or unweighted), by
survey (principal or teacher). The tables also show whether CDC has been given
permission to distribute the data files from each jurisdiction.
