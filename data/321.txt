## Summary

Medicines can treat diseases and improve your health. If you are like most
people, you need to take medicine at some point in your life. You may need to
take medicine every day, or you may only need to take medicine once in a
while. Either way, you want to make sure that your medicines are safe, and
that they will help you get better. In the United States, the Food and Drug
Administration is in charge of ensuring that your prescription and over-the-
counter medicines are safe and effective.

There are always risks to taking medicines. It is important to think about
these risks before you take a medicine. Even safe medicines can cause unwanted
side effects or interactions with food, alcohol, or other medicines you may be
taking. Some medicines may not be safe during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of
reactions and make sure that you get better, it is important for you to take
your medicines correctly. You should also be careful when giving medicines to
children, since they can be more vulnerable to the effects of medicines.
