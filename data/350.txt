## Summary

Kawasaki disease is a rare childhood disease. It makes the walls of the blood
vessels in the body become inflamed. It can affect any type of blood vessel,
including the arteries, veins, and capillaries.

No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease. Symptoms include

  * High fever that lasts longer than 5 days
  * Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
  * A rash on the mid-section and genital area
  * Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue
  * Red, swollen palms of the hands and soles of the feet
  * Redness of the eyes 

Kawasaki disease can't be passed from one child to another. There is no
specific test for Kawasaki disease. To diagnose it, doctors look at the signs
and symptoms. They may also use an echocardiogram or other tests. It is mainly
treated with medicines. Rarely, medical procedures and surgery also may be
used for children whose coronary arteries are affected.

Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. However, most children who develop the
disease fully recover - usually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms.
Further problems are rare.
