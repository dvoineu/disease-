## Summary

Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. They help fight off infections and
play a role in your body's immune response. They can also build up and cause
inflammation.

Normally your blood doesn't have a large number of eosinophils. Your body may
produce more of them in response to

    * Allergic disorders
    * Skin conditions
    * Parasitic and fungal infections
    * Autoimmune diseases
    * Some cancers
    * Bone marrow disorders

In some conditions, the eosinophils can move outside the bloodstream and build
up in organs and tissues. This can happen in many different parts of the body,
including the esophagus, heart, lungs, blood, and intestines. Treatment of
eosinophilic disorders can vary, depending on the cause and which part of the
body is affected. Steroids are often part of the treatment.
