Following are general guidelines for cleaning an International Port of Entry
(IPOE) detention facility that has housed a detainee or employed a staff
member who is suspected to have pandemic influenza. These guidelines provide a
basic framework of response. This guidance may be modified or additional
procedures may be recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) as part of the evaluation of an ill traveler, when an
influenza pandemic becomes widespread in the United States or as new
information about a pandemic strain becomes available.

Influenza viruses can persist on nonporous surfaces for 24 hours or more, but
quantities of the virus sufficient for human infection are likely to persist
for shorter periods. Although the relative importance of virus transfer from
inanimate objects to humans in spreading influenza is not known, hand transfer
of the virus to the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth resulting in
infection is likely to occur. Hand hygiene1, cough etiquette and respiratory
hygiene2 are the principal means of interrupting this type of transmission.
Routine cleaning and disinfection practices may play a role in minimizing the
spread of influenza.

Routine cleaning with soap or detergent and water to remove soil and organic
matter, followed by the proper use of disinfectants are the basic components
of effective environmental management of influenza. Reducing the number of
influenza virus particles on a surface through these steps can reduce the
chances of hand transfer of virus. A number of chemical disinfectants are
readily available and effective against influenza viruses. All disinfectants
marketed in the United States are required to be registered by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These products must be used in
accordance with their label instructions; following label instructions is
necessary to achieve adequate efficacy and to avoid unreasonable adverse
effects.

Environmental infection control focuses on routine and frequent cleaning and
disinfection of surfaces, especially those most often touched by hands. The
routine cleaning methods described in the "INS Detention Standard governing
Environmental Health and Safety pdf icon[253 KB, 21 Pages]external icon" is
available. It should be employed throughout the IPOE Detention Facility with
special attention in certain areas specified below.

Wear non-sterile, disposable gloves that are recommended by the manufacturer
of the detergent/disinfectant when preparing disinfectant and cleaning
solutions and when performing cleaning tasks. Dispose of gloves as routine
solid waste if they become damaged or soiled or when cleaning is completed.
Never wash or reuse disposable gloves. The use of eye protection, such as a
faceshield or goggles, may be required if splashing is expected. Avoid
activities that may generate infectious aerosols. Cleaning activities should
be supervised and inspected periodically to ensure correct procedures are
followed.

### Cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces in non-medical operations
in the IPOE detention facility

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Keep housekeeping surfaces and countertops clean of visible soil with detergents and water or proprietary cleaners, followed by rinsing with water. Repeated application of disinfectants to table- and desktop surfaces is unnecessary. Frequent use of room air deodorizers to disinfect the air is not recommended.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Clean and disinfect bathroom surfaces on a regular basis using EPA-registered detergent/disinfectants. Alternatively, clean surfaces first with detergent and water and then disinfect with an EPA-registered disinfectant in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Follow label instructions carefully; use conditions will vary depending on whether the detergent/disinfectant is used for cleaning or disinfection. Adhere to any safety precautions or other recommendations as directed (e.g. allowing adequate ventilation in confined areas, proper disposal of unused product or used containers).  
If EPA-registered disinfectants are not available, use a dilute solution
(1:100 volume/volume, approximately 600 parts per million [ppm]) of household
chlorine bleach (5.25% or 6.00% sodium hypochlorite) to disinfect bathroom
surfaces. To prepare this solution, add ¼ cup of bleach to a gallon of clean
water, or 2 teaspoons of bleach to a quart of clean water. Apply to a cleaned
surface, preferably with a cloth moistened with the bleach solution, and allow
the surface to remain wet for at least 3 - 5 minutes. Wear gloves to protect
hands while mixing and applying bleach solution.

Spills of bodily fluids (e.g., vomit from an ill detainee) should be handled in accordance to the procedures established in the "INS Detention Standard pdf icon[253 KB, 21 Pages]external icon" governing Environmental Health and Safety.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. Since disinfectants are not registered for use on porous surfaces, removable porous upholstery, rugs and carpeting that have exposure to bodily fluids should be carefully removed and laundered in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions or disposed of as described below. Porous upholstery and carpeting that cannot be removed may be cleaned with water and detergent. The material should then be allowed to air dry.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5. When cleaning is completed, collect soiled material and gloves in a sturdy, leakproof (e.g., plastic) bag that is tied shut and not reopened. Porous materials that will be laundered can be transported in the same manner. State and local governments should be consulted for appropriate disposal decisions. Barring specific state solid or medical waste regulations to the contrary, these wastes are considered routine solid wastes that can be sent to municipal solid waste landfills without treatment.

IPOE detention facility

The basic strategies for management of environmental surfaces in healthcare
facilities are discussed in the CDC/Healthcare Infection Control Practices
Advisory Committee (HICPAC) "Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in
Health-Care Facilities" is available. Additional guidance pdf icon[2.55 MB, 93
Pages]external icon is available from the World Health Organization. The
guidance which follows is drawn from these resources.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Frequently clean and disinfect -using disinfectants as described above - surfaces that are touched routinely by hands (e.g., doorknobs, bed rails, bedside- and over-bed tables, bathroom surfaces, safety/pull-up bars, television controls, and call buttons).

Educate patients, staff, and visitors about the importance of handwashing and hand hygiene, emphasizing good practices (e.g., avoid touching nose, mouth, or eyes after touching a potentially contaminated surface or object).

### Laundry

Although influenza viruses can persist on porous materials, the transfer of
these viruses from sheets, bedding, and clothing is not an efficient process.
Therefore, management of laundry in medical operations and in the detention
facility in general can be accomplished with existing procedures appropriate
for these settings.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5. Use a temperature setting for drying clothes and linens appropriate for the fabrics in the load.

Routine Solid Wastes and Regulated Medical Wastes from the Detention Facility

There is no evidence to suggest that either pandemic influenza virus or
seasonal influenza viruses can be spread via contact with either routine solid
wastes or regulated medical wastes generated either in a healthcare facility
or in a home, school, or business. Therefore, current waste management
strategies should continue to be used during a pandemic.

### Waste from Medical Operations

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Use Standard Precautions when working with solid waste that may be contaminated with influenza virus outside of patient isolation areas.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as is currently required by your state (e.g., gloves) when handling open waste containers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. No changes in waste containment need be made during periods of influenza activity (e.g., single bag lining for routine clinic wastes, appropriate labeled containment for regulated medical wastes).

1 When washing hands with soap and water: Wet your hands with clean running
water and apply soap. Use warm water if it is available. Rub hands together to
make a lather and scrub all surfaces. Continue rubbing hands for 20 seconds.
Rinse hands well under running water. Dry your hands using a paper towel or
air dryer. If possible, use your paper towel to turn off the faucet. Remember:
If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand gel to clean
hands. When using an alcohol-based hand gel: Apply product to the palm of one
hand. Rub hands together. Rub the product over all surfaces of hands and
fingers until hands are dry. (Good Health Habits for Preventing Seasonal Flu)

2 The following measures to contain respiratory secretions are recommended for
all individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection: Cover the
nose/mouth when coughing or sneezing; use tissues to contain respiratory
secretions and dispose of them in the nearest covered waste receptacle after
use; if you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not
your hands; perform hand hygiene (e.g., hand washing with non-antimicrobial
soap and water, alcohol-based hand gel, or antiseptic handwash) after having
contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials
(Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette in Healthcare Settings and Cover Your
Cough)

3Employees should be trained to remove PPE to prevent self-inoculation (e.g.,
touching a contaminated glove and then touching one's eyes, nose, or mouth).
