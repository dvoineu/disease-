Introduction A number of DNA-based molecular typing methods have been used in epidemiological investigations of bacterial pathogens and studying bacterial population genetics and evolution. Some methods are suitable for characterizing strains that cause localized outbreaks; others are particularly useful for determining the long-term relationships of strains and their population structures (1). For local outbreak investigation, molecular typing methods with a high degree of resolution are necessary to detect subtle differences in what most likely are genetically related strains. These assays are also useful for detecting changes in molecular type during prolonged outbreaks. Highly discriminatory assays typically index genomic variations that accumulate rapidly and can be used to detect microvariations that can be used to identify strains circulating in a specific geographic area. The methods that have been used for this purpose including ribotyping, random amplified polymorphic DNA, fluorescent amplified-fragment length polymorphism, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The high resolution of these assays will sometimes resolve subtle differences that MLST cannot, thus they are particularly useful for studying local epidemiology or tracing the spread of highly related strains during outbreaks/clusters of cases (1, 7, 15).PFGE is one of the most widely used molecular typing methods because of the resolving power of the technique. In brief, PFGE uses a restriction enzyme to cut genomic DNA infrequently at a specific sequence to produce a number of fragments that are then size-fractionated on an agarose gel. The resultant banding patterns are analyzed and compared to other isolates. During an outbreak or a cluster of cases, PFGE is used in combination with epidemiologic information and other typing techniques to help identify outbreak isolates and determine the relationships among the isolates. A promising technique with similar discriminatory capabilities that is gaining acceptance is multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). In MLVA, the variability in the numbers of short tandem repeat sequences that are found in specific areas of the genome are utilized to create DNA fingerprints for epidemiological studies. Once the appropriate loci are established, MLVA yields clustering similar to PFGE (13) and the use of highly variable-number tandem repeats results in a high degree of differentiation with suitable resolution to discriminate between strains in an outbreak or cluster (24, 34).Tracking the population biology of bacterial organisms on a global or even national scale requires a molecular typing method based on slowly accumulating selectively neutral genetic variations that will still distinguish between genotypes yet can identify clonal groups. One of the most common selectively neutral areas of a genome are housekeeping genes encoding proteins involved in the metabolism of the organism. The first molecular typing method to utilize this attribute was multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). MLEE analyses the electrophoretic mobilities of metabolic housekeeping enzymes on a starch gel and equates changes in mobility of each enzyme with allelic variants of each loci (1, 7). In order to obtain high resolution, 20 or more loci are analyzed for each isolate. The genetic variation leading to the changes necessary to cause mobility shifts are thought to be selectively neutral, thus the electrophoretic type of a bacterial clone should be relatively stable over time (7). MLEE was instrumental as a typing method in early global epidemiology studies and population biology analysis, but the method is technically demanding, and because MLEE is gel-based, results between laboratories are very difficult to compare.In 1998, Maiden et al developed a DNA-based method of molecular typing _N. meningitidis_ that retained the concepts utilized by MLEE of analyzing housekeeping genes not under any known immunologic selection. MLST defines strains by their allelic profiles determined from the nucleotide sequences of internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes rather than by shifting electrophoretic mobility patterns of the enzymes they encode (15). This approach has been adapted for use in typing many types of bacteria, including _H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ , and is now the most widely used method for molecular typing. While MLST is more expensive to perform, it has the following advantages over MLEE:

MLST is not suitable to use to characterize potential differences in strains
within an outbreak as its power to resolve small evolutionary differences is
too low. Therefore, to provide further discriminatory power, MLST data can be
combined with PFGE and sequence data from other more variable loci under
positive selective pressure, such as PorA, PorB, FetA, and fHbp in _N.
meningitidis_ , and the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and PspA in _S.
pneumoniae_. It is this variability that makes these proteins excellent
markers for short-term epidemiology investigations. Sequence data for these
markers is also valuable for assessing the allelic distribution of these
vaccine candidate proteins that can aid in rational vaccine design.

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and typing of other variable genes of _N. meningitidis_ , _H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ The PCR primers and protocols included here are used at CDC and work well. However, many laboratories use different PCR reaction protocols, chemistries, buffers, primer concentrations and even different equipment for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Other protocols work well and it is up to the discretion of each laboratory to discern the optimal reagents and assay conditions for their laboratory, including appropriate validation and quality control.The primers listed in this manual have been designed and optimized over time as more sequence data has become available. By comparing DNA sequences for a given area of interest from dozens to hundreds of different strains of _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae_ , or _S. pneumoniae_ , small areas of homology can be detected that provide an area from which PCR and DNA sequencing primers can be designed that have the greatest likelihood of working. In some instances, a perfect consensus cannot be found which will react with all strains. In these cases, degenerate primers are designed that have a mix of nucleotides at a certain position. For example, when either a "C" or a "T" nucleotide can occupy a position, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), designates it as "Y".

Preparation of DNA template For each of the assays described below a preparation of DNA must be extracted. A pure culture of each isolate is grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood for _N. meningitidis_ and _S. pneumoniae_ , or chocolated agar plates supplemented with hemin and NAD for _H. influenzae_ in a humidified incubator for 18-24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Fast DNA extraction protocols for _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ can be found in Appendix 1 at the end of this chapter. Additional methods for DNA extraction that will provide purified DNA can be found in Chapter 10: PCR Methods or commercially available DNA extraction kits can be used.

Overview and MLST schemes for _N. meningitidis_ , _H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_ The housekeeping genes selected for MLST are not closely linked in bacterial genomes and have conserved sequence regions that are sufficient to design PCR primers that will amplify all or nearly all of the isolates. The number of housekeeping genes to be examined reflects an optimal balance between resolution of genotypes and laboratory workload. The internal fragments are of a length to provide sufficient variation for identification of different alleles and for each strand to be accurately sequenced using only a single primer for each direction. Sequences that differ by even a single nucleotide are considered unique and no weight is given to the number of nucleotide changes in a given allele. Each unique allele is assigned a number in order of discovery and each isolate can be characterized by its multilocus genotypic or allelic profile, designated as sequence type (ST), which is the combination of its alleles over the seven genetic loci. STs can be further grouped into clonal complexes (CC), which are defined in the Neisseria MLST profile database as a group of STs that share at least four of the seven loci in common with a central ST (30).MLST schemes have been developed for _N. meningitidis_ (15) (Table 1), _H. influenzae_ (20) (Table 2), _S. pneumoniae_ (7) (Table 3) and many othersexternal icon. Each scheme uses defined regions of seven housekeeping genes. A general protocol for performing MLST and analyzing the data is given below.Table 1. _N. meningitidis_ MLST scheme, including gene locus, amplicon length, and trimmed length of sequence used for allelic determination

Primers used for PCR amplificationThe primers used for PCR amplification for each scheme are shown in Table 4 (N. meningitidis), Table 5 (H. influenzae), and Table 6 (S. pneumoniae). In addition, the primers currently in use are listed in the MLST web pages for the schemes, https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon look under "information", and http://haemophilus.mlst.net/external icon, look under "Organism Specific Information" and go to page 2. Note that for S. pneumoniae, the primers listed are from two different sources. See the original MLST primers for S. pneumoniaeexternal icon. However, it has been found that these primers for aroE, recP, spi, xpt, and ddl are too close to the target sequences for accurate sequencing results using a capillary sequencer, thus alternative primers that lie about 40 bases further upstream and downstream of the target sequences were designed.

PCR reaction setup and cycling conditionsThe PCR conditions to be used for each scheme are given below (Tables 7 and 8). PCR set up and cycling conditions for each assay can also be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon look under "information", and http://haemophilus.mlst.net/external icon or http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/external icon, look under "Organism Specific Information".Reactions are performed in 50 µl volumes for _N. meningitidis_ and _H. influenzae_ , and in 25 µl volumes for _S. pneumoniae_ in either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. When setting up the PCR reactions keep the reagents from warming up to room temperature by keeping them on ice. This is especially important for the _Taq_ DNA polymerase.Table 7.

Once the PCR reactions are set-up, immediately place them in the PCR machine
and run. The cycling conditions for MLST differ slightly for each organism
(Table 9, _N. meningitidis_ , except for _pgm_ ; Table 10, _N. meningitidis,
pgm_ ; Table 11, _H. influenzae_ ; and Table 12, _S. pneumoniae_ ). Note that
the annealing temperature of the reactions may need to be optimized when
adapting the protocols for use in your laboratory.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelIt is useful to check for a successful PCR amplification before moving onto reaction clean-up and sequencing. The protocol for analyzing the amplified PCR products can be found in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter.

Nucleotide sequencing of MLST PCR productsTo perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified by the method of choice before sequencing reactions can be performed. These include gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol".The PCR primers and protocols included here are those used at CDC and are optimized for these laboratories. Other protocols work well and it is up to the discretion of each laboratory to discern the optimal reagents and assay conditions for their laboratory, including appropriate validation and quality control. For a commonly used protocol, see: https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)".Sequencing reactions for all assays described here should be carried out on both strands. Sequencing each strand provides greater confidence in the base calls versus having base calls made using a single data point.

Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. Some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 µl volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The setup in Table 14 will work for sequencing MLST amplicons from _N. meningitidis, H. influenzae_ , and _S. pneumoniae_.Table 14. MLST sequencing PCR reaction set-up

Purification of the sequencing reaction productsBefore the reaction products can be resolved on an automated DNA sequencer, the products must be purified to remove unincorporated fluorescent dyes, buffer, and unused deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. This can be achieved using a variety of commercially available kits that utilize gel filtration or a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system to purify the products. Conversely, the reaction products can be purified by precipitation with ethanol and 3M sodium acetate, pH 4.6 (see https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon and click on "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)". Typically, the reaction products will be purified and dried down in a 96-well plate and reconstituted with formamide, EDTA, or water before electrophoresis. Each laboratory should follow the manufacturer's protocol for the automatic sequencer system being employed.See the Analysis of Sequence Data and Allele Determination section below for further information about data analysis.

OverviewThe antigenic diversity expressed by the five major classes of outer membrane proteins (OMP) on the surface of _N. meningitidis_ have been utilized to develop isolate subtyping and characterization schemes and to develop vaccines. The largest of the OMPs expressed by most meningococcal isolates is the PorA or class 1 protein. The PorA protein is a transmembrane protein predicted to have 8 loops exposed on the surface of the organism. These loops contain two hypervariable regions, VR1 (loop 1) and VR2 (loop 4), and two semivariable regions, SV1 (loop 5) and SV2 (loop 6). Sequence analysis of SV1 and SV2 demonstrated that sequence differences in these regions were too limited to generate subtype differences between strains, thus PorA typing is based on the VR1 and VR2 hypervariable sequences, which have greater resolution (16, 19).Additionally, all _N. meningitidis_ express PorB which is expressed as 2 alternate alleles that were previously called class 2 and 3 proteins. These have been named PorB2 and PorB3, respectively, and are mutually exclusive, though hybrids do exist. PorB has four hypervariable loop regions referred to as VR1, on loop I; VR2, on loop V; VR3, on loop VI; and VR4, on loop VII (32). Historically, serotyping is based on the reactivity of specific antisera to the variable regions of PorB. The antigenically important variable epitopes that are targeted by serological typing reagents reside in the surface-exposed loops of PorA and PorB (29, 31). In addition, these regions are targeted by the host immune response and are thus under intensive selective pressure. Subtyping isolates based on sequencing of the _porA_ and _porB_ genes and translation of the DNA into their respective amino acids for typing has been helpful in characterizing isolates in clusters or outbreaks and for determining differences between isolates. Note that the _porA_ gene is deleted in some isolates, though this is a rare occurrence (32).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Primers used for PCR amplificationThe primers used for PCR amplification of the _porA_ and _porB_ genes of _N. meningitidis_ are shown in Table 16. Primer set 1 should be used first when amplifying the _porA_ gene. If PCR amplification fails using primer set 1; alternative primer sets 2 and/or 3 should be used.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. PCR reaction setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 50 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates (Table 17). If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA.Table 16.

### Footnotes

1The GenBank Accession number given may not be that of the strain actually
used to design the PCR primers, but it is a strain that contains the primer
sequences.  
2These are the predicted amplicon sizes for the strain with the given GenBank
Accession number. Because of the variable nature of these genes, the amplicon
in other strains may differ from the size listed. porA is deleted in some
strains, though deletions are rare.  
3Primers sets 2 and 3 are alternate primer sets that can be used when the porA
gene does not amplify with primer set 1.

*Some laboratories scale back the reaction volumes to 25 µl. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 25 µl volumes are desired.

Once the PCR reactions are set-up, immediately place them in the PCR machine
and run. The cycling conditions for _porA_ and _porB_ differ slightly for each
assay (Table 18 for _porA_ and Table 19 for _porB_ ). Note that the annealing
temperature of the reactions may need to be optimized when adapting the
protocols for use in your laboratory.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelIt is useful to check for a successful PCR amplification before moving onto reaction clean-up and sequencing. The protocol analyzing the amplified PCR products can be found in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter.

Nucleotide sequencing of _porA_ and _porB_ PCR productsTo perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified by the method of choice before sequencing reactions can be performed. These include gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol".The PCR primers and protocols included here are those used at CDC and are optimized for these laboratories. Other protocols work well and it is up to the discretion of each laboratory to discern the optimal reagents and assay conditions for their laboratory, including appropriate validation and quality control. For a commonly used protocol, see: https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)".Sequencing reactions for all assays described here should be carried out on both strands. Sequencing each strand provides greater confidence in the base calls versus having base calls made using a single data point.

Sequencing primers for _porA_ and _porB_ typingThe primers used to sequence the _porA_ (Table 20) and _porB_ (Table 21) amplicons are shown. VR1 of _porA_ can be determined by using primers U86 and R435 and VR2 can be determined by using F435 and R773. To determine the class of the PorB protein, all seven of the primers listed in the chart for _porB_ must be used.Table 20. Sequencing primers for _porA_

Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. Some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 µl volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditions are shown below in Tables 22 and 23, respectively.Table 22. _porA_ and _porB_ sequencing PCR reaction set-up

Purification of the sequencing reaction productsBefore the reaction products can be resolved on an automated DNA sequencer, the products must be purified to remove unincorporated fluorescent dyes, buffer, and unused deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. This can be achieved using a variety of commercially available kits that utilize gel filtration or a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system to purify the products. Conversely, the reaction products can be purified by precipitation with ethanol and 3M sodium acetate, pH 4.6 (see https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon and click on "information" and "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)". Typically, the reaction products will be purified and dried down in a 96-well plate and reconstituted with formamide, EDTA, or water before electrophoresis. Each laboratory should follow the manufacturer's protocol for the automatic sequencer system being employed.See the Analysis of Sequence Data and Allele Determination section below for further information about data analysis.

OverviewFetA (ferric enterobactin transport), formerly FrpB (iron-repressed protein B) is a 76 kDa iron-regulated OMP that is expressed to a high level during iron limitation (6). Modeling of the structure of FetA predicts 13 surface-exposed loops. Anti-FetA antibodies to the most variable of these loops have bactericidal properties (29). FetA has been proposed as a potential vaccine candidate. However, this region is highly variable which limits the potential of this antigen to be the sole component of a vaccine. Obtaining the amino acid sequence of this variable region by sequencing the DNA of this region of the _fetA_ gene is useful in characterizing clones emerging or circulating in local populations (28). Note that the _fetA_ gene is deleted in some isolates, though this is a rare occurrence (3, 17).

PCR reaction setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 50 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates (Table 25). If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA.Once the PCR reactions are set-up, immediately place them in the PCR machine and run. The cycling conditions for _fetA_ are shown in Table 26. Note that the annealing temperature of the reactions may need to be optimized when adapting the protocols for use in your laboratory.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelIt is useful to check for a successful PCR amplification before moving onto reaction clean-up and sequencing. The protocol analyzing the amplified PCR products can be found in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter.

Nucleotide sequencing of _fetA_ PCR productsTo perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified by the method of choice before sequencing reactions can be performed. These include gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol".The PCR primers and protocols included here are those used at CDC and are optimized for these laboratories. Other protocols work well and it is up to the discretion of each laboratory to discern the optimal reagents and assay conditions for their laboratory, including appropriate validation and quality control. For a commonly used protocol, see: https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)".Sequencing reactions for all assays described here should be carried out on both strands. Sequencing each strand provides greater confidence in the base calls versus having base calls made using a single data point.

Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. Some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 µl volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditions are shown below in Tables 28 and 29, respectively.Table 28. _fetA_ sequencing PCR reaction set-up

Purification of the sequencing reaction productsBefore the reaction products can be resolved on an automated DNA sequencer, the products must be purified to remove unincorporated fluorescent dyes, buffer, and unused deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. This can be achieved using a variety of commercially available kits that utilize gel filtration or a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system to purify the products. Conversely, the reaction products can be purified by precipitation with ethanol and 3M sodium acetate, pH 4.6 (see https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon and click on "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)". Typically, the reaction products will be purified and dried down in a 96-well plate and reconstituted with formamide, EDTA, or water before electrophoresis. It is recommended that each laboratory follow the manufacturer's protocol for the automatic sequencer system being employed.See the Analysis of Sequence Data and Allele Determination section below for further information about data analysis.

OverviewFactor H binding protein (fHbp), also referred to as Genome-derived Neisserial Antigen 1870 (GNA1870) or lipoprotein 2086 (LP2086 protein), is a ~28 KD surface exposed protein that binds to human factor H, a negative regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation. fHbp is widely distributed in _N. meningitidis_. Recruitment of factor H to the surface of _N. meningitidis_ facilitates bacterial escape from the host innate immune system and promotes bacterial survival in the host (23). fHbp also induces bactericidal activity against _N._ _meningitidis_ strains expressing this protein; thus it is a viable vaccine candidate protein and component vaccines including fHbp are currently under evaluation (9, 22). Analysis of the amino acid sequences from the mature form of fHbp, which does not include the leader peptide, reveals two distinct groups, subfamily A and B (22). However, DNA sequence analysis demonstrates three variant groups: group 1 (corresponding to subfamily B) and group 2 and 3 (together corresponding to subfamily A) (18). The data collected to date indicate some correlation of fHbp alleles with MLST or serogroups (18). Continuing determination of fHbp sequence diversity provides valuable information for the evaluation of potential vaccine efficacy and coverage as well as characterizing circulating populations of _N. meningitidis_.

PCR reaction setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 50 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates (Table 31). If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA.Once the PCR reactions are set-up, immediately place them in the PCR machine and run. The cycling conditions for _fHbp_ are shown in Table 32. Note that the annealing temperature of the reactions may need to be optimized when adapting the protocols for use in your laboratory.Table 30.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelIt is useful to check for a successful PCR amplification before moving onto reaction clean-up and sequencing. The protocol analyzing the amplified PCR products can be found in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter.

Nucleotide sequencing of _fHbp_ PCR productsTo perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified by the method of choice before sequencing reactions can be performed. These include gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol".The PCR primers and protocols included here are those used at CDC and are optimized for these laboratories. Other protocols work well and it is up to the discretion of each laboratory to discern the optimal reagents and assay conditions for their laboratory, including appropriate validation and quality control. For a commonly used protocol, see: https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)".Sequencing reactions for all assays described here should be carried out on both strands. Sequencing each strand provides greater confidence in the base calls versus having base calls made using a single data point.

Sequencing primers for _fHbp_ typingThe primers used to sequence the _fHbp_ amplicon are the same as those used for amplification, but should be used at a concentration of 3.2 µM.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7. Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. However, some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 µl volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditions are shown below in Tables 33 and 34, respectively.Table 33. _fHbp_ sequencing PCR reaction set-up

Purification of the sequencing reaction productsBefore the reaction products can be resolved on an automated DNA sequencer, the products must be purified to remove unincorporated fluorescent dyes, buffer, and unused deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. This can be achieved using a variety of commercially available kits that utilize gel filtration or a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system to purify the products. Conversely, the reaction products can be purified by precipitation with ethanol and 3M sodium acetate, pH 4.6 (see https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon and click on "information" and "sequencing protocol (microtiter plates)". Typically, the reaction products will be purified and dried down in a 96-well plate and reconstituted with formamide, EDTA, or water before electrophoresis. It is recommended that each laboratory follow the manufacturer's protocol for the automatic sequencer system being employed.See the Analysis of Sequence Data and Allele Determination section below for further information about data analysis.

Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)Alterations in PBPs are the major mechanism of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins in _S. pneumoniae_. These bacteria possess several high-molecular-weight PBPs, and most decreased susceptibility and resistance is associated with alterations in PBP1a, PBP2b, and PBP2x. Remarkably, the vast majority of naturally occurring isolates displaying penicillin MICs _>_ 0.25 ug/ml are characterized by carrying mosaic alleles of these genes that contain segments of closely related non-pneumococcal species. Sequence differences in the genes encoding these PBPs have been exploited to subtype β-lactam-resistant _S. pneumoniae_ isolates. These methods include restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) analysis of PCR products amplified from _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2x, or comparisons of sequences of the amplified products to determine amino acid changes in these genes (5, 21, 26)

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelTo check for successful PCR amplification, run 5 ml of the end-products on a 1% agarose gel (see protocol in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter). Store the remainder at -20°C or proceed to RFLP analyses and/or PCR cleanup and DNA sequencing.

RFLP analysesPBP-gene amplicons are subjected to _Hae_ III plus _Rsa_ I digestion by the addition of 3U of the respective enzymes to 5 µl of unpurified PCR product, followed by 1-4 hr of incubation at 37°C (8). Fragments are then separated on a 2% agarose gel (see Appendix 2 at the end of the chapter, but add 2 g of agarose to 100 ml sterile distilled H2O instead of 1 g) and should include a DNA ladder (1kb) on each gel to allow for comparison of fingerprints. After electrophoresis, the gel is visualized under UV and the image captured using a camera.

DNA sequencingSequencing of PCR products can also be setup to determine specific DNA sequences and amino acid changes that may be present in _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2xgenes. To perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified by the method of choice before sequencing reactions can be performed. These include gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol". Various chemistries and platforms are available for sequencing and many laboratories outsource their sequencing to commercial companies.

Sequencing primers for _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2xThe primers used to sequence the _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2x amplicons are the same as those used for amplification of the genes as well as the additional primers listed in Table 35, but should be used at a final concentration of 0.3 µM.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7. Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. However, some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 ml volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditions are shown below in Tables 38 and 39, respectively.Table 38. _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2x sequencing PCR reaction set-up

InterpretationAfter PCR and RFLP analysis the patterns can be visually compared or compared by using an RFLP analyses program to determine clusters of related _pbp_ patterns. For sequence analysis of the _pbp_ genes, the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence data for strains are compared to the corresponding sequence data for the β-lactam susceptible laboratory isolate R6 (sequence available at GenBank accession numbers: _pbp1a_ M90527; _pbp2b_ X16022; _pbp2x_ X16367) using DNA sequence alignment software. Mutations at positions in or close to each of the three (SXXK, SXN, and KXG) conserved motifs for PBP2b, PBP2x and PBP1a can then be identified and compared.

Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA)PspA is a surface protein and virulence factor found on all isolates of _S. pneumoniae_ and is highly immunogenic. The _pspA_ gene is variable at the nucleotide level, and the amino acid similarity of the surface-exposed N-terminal region of PspA proteins can be as little as 40%. Based on nucleotide and amino acid identity, _pspA_ genes and encoded PspA proteins are classified together into six clades, subdivided into three families: family 1 (clades 1 and 2), family 2 (clades 3, 4, and 5), and the rarely observed family 3 (clade 6) (11). The extent of cross-reactivity of PspA clades follows roughly the degree of amino acid sequence homology and is maximal within strains of the same PspA family. The family can be recognized serologically, but the clade must be identified by the sequence. Studies have demonstrated that PspA family and clade distribution are independent of serotype, age, and clinical origin of the isolates, but are highly associated with genotype as determined by PFGE and/or MLST (33).A PCR assay has been developed using primers specific for families 1, 2, and 3. Most isolates are either in family 1 or 2, thus two PCR reactions using primers family1- and 2-specific should be performed on each isolate. If both of these are negative, a PCR reaction using the primers specific for the rarely seen family 3 should be performed. Clade determination requires obtaining the DNA sequence of the allele, thus another PCR amplification reaction is required using primers that will amplify all three families. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Primers used for PCR amplificationPrimers specific for family 1 are LSM12 and SKH63 and for family 2 are LSM12 and SKH52 (33). A test for PspA family 3 can also be run using primers SKH41 and SKH42 (10) (Table 40). Isolates that are negative in all PCR reactions are classified as nontypeable (10).If the isolate is positive for one of the families, the clade in which the isolate belongs can be identified only through obtaining the DNA sequence of the allele. To do this, perform another PCR amplification using primers LSM12 and SKH2, which will amplify all 3 families. This amplicon will then need to be sequenced (see below).Table 40.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gelTo check for successful PCR amplification and to determine to which family the allele belongs, run 5 µl of the end-products on a 1% agarose gel (see protocol in Appendix 2 at the end of the chapter). The remainder should be stored at -20°C or PCR cleanup and DNA sequencing can be performed immediately after successful PCR amplification has been confirmed.

InterpretationThe family 1-, 2- and 3-specific primers will produce PCR products that are approximately 1,000 bp for family 1, 1,200 bp for family 2 and 770 bp for family 3 and can be used to assign strains into _pspA_ families.

DNA Sequencing to determine cladeThe amplicon derived from the PCR amplification using primers LSM12 and SKH2 can be sequenced to determine the clade in which the isolate belongs. To perform DNA nucleotide sequencing, the DNA amplicons must be purified either by gel filtration columns, a solid phase reversible immobilization magnetic bead-based system, or PEG8000/2.5M NaCl precipitation before sequencing reactions can be performed. Commercial kits for gel filtration columns are available from several companies and a protocol for PEG precipitation can be found at https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon under "information" then "PCR protocol". Various chemistries and platforms are available for sequencing and many laboratories outsource their sequencing to commercial companies.

Sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditionsReactions are performed in 20 µl volumes either in 8-well tube strips or in 96-well plates. However, some laboratories perform sequencing reactions in 10 µl volumes. Adjust each component of the reaction accordingly if 10 µl volumes are desired. If doing many reactions, it is useful to prepare a master mix of reagents equal to the number of reactions plus one for each locus with all components except for the DNA. The sequencing PCR setup and cycling conditions are shown below in Tables 43 and 44, respectively.Table 43. Clade sequencing PCR reaction set-up

InterpretationThe DNA sequences generated are used to determine the amino acid sequence searched against the sequence database by using BLAST software (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTexternal icon). To further classify the strains, the diversity based on _pspA_ clades is determined by comparing the amino acid sequences found for strains tested with those amino acid sequences of the clade-defining region of 24 invasive reference sequences retrieved from GenBank [Accession numbers AF071802 to AF071809 (Clade 1), AF07810 to AF071814, M74122 (Clade 2), AF071816 to AF071818 (Clades 3), AF071821, AF071824, AF071826, U89711 (Clade 4), AF071820 (Clade 5), and AF071823 (Clade 6)] (33). PspA proteins in the same clade share similar sequences and any variation of sequences within clades is restricted to single-amino-acid substitutions. Clade type can also be established by determining clusters using the DNA sequences to generate a dendrogram with software using Pearson's coefficient and the hierarchical unweighted pair group method (UPGMA). Proteins within the same clade are greater than 90% identical in sequence.

Analysis of sequence data and allele determinationAfter the sequence reaction products have been resolved and the data obtained from the sequencer, the trace files must be analyzed for incorrect base calls and the complementary strands must be aligned. For MLST, the alleles must be aligned and trimmed so that they correspond exactly to the regions that are used to define the alleles. For the OMPs, the sequence is translated so that the allele types or clade determination based on the amino acid sequence can be made. In addition the nucleotide changes in the domains typically responsible for penicillin resistance in the _pbp_ 1a, _pbp_ 2b and _pbp_ 2x genes in _S. pneumoniae_ need to be determined. Various computer packages are suitable for assembling, aligning and editing the trace files from the automated DNA sequencer to create consensus sequence files suitable for these analyses. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. MLST sequence analysisOnce consensus sequences are available, they can be uploaded to websites for allelic analysis and sequence type designations. For _N. meningitidis_ MLST go to https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/external icon and look under "Access main databases", for _H. influenzae_ MLST go to http://haemophilus.mlst.net/external icon and use "locus query" to obtain allele types and "profile query" to obtain a sequence type, and for _S. pneumoniae_ MLST go to http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/external icon and use "locus query" to obtain allele types and "profile query" to obtain sequence types. Consensus sequences of each gene fragment are compared with those in the databases. The software checks that the sequences are the correct length and that they do not contain any undetermined characters. Options are available to identify the allele at a single locus, to enter an allele profile, to find isolates in the database that match or nearly match an allele profile, or to browse the database. Consensus sequences not represented in the database can be submitted as a new allele. The database curator evaluates the trace files of the sequence before assigning a number to the new allele and including it in the database. In addition, the databases have links to various programs for further data analyses.Freeware programs that provide the capability of assembly, aligning, editing, producing a consensus sequence, and also provide MLST types and clonal complex types in one package are the Sequence Type Analysis and Retrieval System (STARS) and the Meningococcus Genome Informatics Platform (MGIP). In addition, both systems are expandable to include other species and loci. However, STARS is Linux-based, requires technical expertise to program for expansion and no longer has technical support. MGIP is a web-based interface requiring only a computer and an internet connection that allows the user to upload to the website sequence trace files and a worksheet template. Analyzed sequence data, including ST and CC designations, will be returned to the user within minutes of submission (12). Furthermore, MGIP will also perform OMP analysis and is expandable to include any loci the user wishes to add. At this writing, MGIP is only available for _N. meningitidis_ loci, but is being expanded to include _S. pneumoniae_ and _H. influenzae_.

Analyzing a set of sequence data using MGIPMGIP does not require a user to register to use the website. However, if accessing the website functions as a public user any data uploaded is available for anyone to see and download. It is thus advisable to register, which only requires a username, password, first and last name, email address, and institution.MGIP requires two files to be uploaded in order to analyze data: 1) A zip file or compressed archive of the sequencing trace files; and 2) A spreadsheet template file in the CSV (comma separated values) format that identifies the name of the reaction, the type of assay (MLST, _porA_ , etc), and primer in each well of the sequencing plate. Note that multiple typing schemes can be analyzed on a single plate.

Compressing (or zipping) the trace filesUploading is done by the set, which is all of the trace file data from a 96-well plate. Do not rename the trace files. MGIP depends on the coordinates in each filename to map each trace file back to the spreadsheet. Thus, if you must rename the trace filenames, preserve the coordinates (e.g., instead of the filename 1433_B01.ab1, you can rename the file to 999_aroE_B01.ab1). In order to upload a data set: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. Put all of the sequencing files associated with the data set to be analyzed into a single folder.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Zip the folder. In Windows, right click the folder, select "Send To" and then "Compressed "zipped" folder." (Figure 1). If the "send to" is not on the menu, then select "add to zip file" or "create archive." Any of these options will create a zip file.

There are ways to create zip files in most operating systems such as MacOS or
Linux, which are very similar to the method described above. The resulting
file must be a zip of the directory of trace files and can have any name.

Creating the template spreadsheetEach cell in the spreadsheet corresponds to the appropriate well from the sequencing plate. For example, a trace file from a well might be automatically named 1433_B01.ab1, which corresponds to the first column, second row of your wells. Hypothetically, if the well B01 contains the locus _pgm__ from the strain M2341 and it was the forward primer, then the correct way to label the cell is M2341.MLST.pgm_.1. _The correct way to label each cell in the spreadsheet is_ strain.sequencingTypingMethod.locus.primer. Any blank well should either be blank or have the word BLANK in the cell.To generate an entire spreadsheet (which you may have to modify), you can use the form found on the upload page under the Automatic Spreadsheet Generation section. After viewing the resulting table from the Automatic Spreadsheet Generator, you can click the download button to save the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet must be in CSV format, which is available as a "save as…" option in Excel and in other spreadsheet programs. Therefore you can convert any spreadsheet you have to a CSV format by opening it in a spreadsheet program and saving it as a CSV.

By strainThe user can view their strains in a table alongside their alleles. Click the "strain table" link from the main menu. Strains are listed on the left, alleles in the middle, and lastly, the derived Sequence Type is on the right. If enough information is present, then the database will indicate the ST of the isolate. If insufficient data is present to designate a ST, then a list of all possible STs is given (Figure 4). In the case of a combination of alleles that are not present in the database, a designation of "novel strain" will be displayed.

OverviewPulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is an agarose gel-based typing method that assesses strain inter-relatedness by comparison of complete genomes and has been applied to at least 40 pathogens (25). PFGE involves digesting genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme that cleaves chromosomal DNA infrequently to produce a small number (11-41) of fragments of different sizes. The resulting fragments are usually large and unable to be separated efficiently by conventional uni-directional electrical field gel electrophoresis. Two of the most commonly used methods to size-fractionate these large digestion products for PFGE are the contour-clamped homogenous electric field (CHEF) and field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE). CHEF uses a hexagonal array of 24 electrodes that produce an alternating 120° angle uniform electrical field. FIGE is based on a conventional electrophoresis in which the electric field is periodically inverted by 180° (25). In both CHEF and FIGE, the electric field used for PFGE is periodically alternated or pulsed to facilitate the migration of the DNA fragments through the gel. Larger fragments migrate through the gel slower than smaller fragments creating a size-based banding pattern that has larger fragments near the top of the gel and smaller fragments near the bottom of the gel (4, 14, 25). The resulting banding pattern can be analyzed by visual inspection or by using a computer program to determine differences in the banding patterns between isolates.PFGE is a highly discriminatory subtyping tool and is particularly suitable for outbreak or cluster investigations. PFGE is used in combination with epidemiologic information to help identify outbreak isolates and to determine the relationships among isolates associated with the outbreak or cluster. The etiological agents in outbreaks are often clonal and produce indistinguishable PFGE patterns, but point mutations and insertions or deletions can occur during an outbreak that lead to a PFGE pattern difference of two or three fragments in isolates linked to the outbreak. Guidelines have been developed to interpret the minor variations in PFGE patterns from closely related strains, but these guidelines do not take into account the total genetic variation observed within the circulating population (27). Isolates that differ by two or three fragments are still considered epidemiologically linked subtypes of the same strain.

Preparation for PFGE

Time required for procedure

PFGE requires approximately 28-30 hours once overnight cultures are available,
thus time management is important in planning the procedure.

Growth of bacteria

A pure culture of each isolate is grown on trypticase soy agar plates
supplemented with 5% sheep blood for _N. meningitidis_ and _S. pneumoniae_ ,
or chocolate agar plates supplemented with hemin and NAD for _H. influenzae_
in a humidified incubator for 18-24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. If the isolate
does not look pure or if the growth is not sufficient, subculture in a
humidified incubator for 18-24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Preparation of gel plugs

Fill water baths to the correct water level with deionized water. Turn on
shaking bath at 54°C and non-shaking baths at 56°C and 37°C. Prepare or re-
melt plug agarose (see above) and hold at 56°C in the water bath until used.

Add 400 µl of melted plug agarose and mix gently by pipetting the mixture up and down several times. Add 400 µl of the mix to fill a well of a 10-well reusable or disposable plug mold. Repeat for each suspension, filling all of the designated wells. Let the plugs harden for 5 min at 4°C or 15 min at room temperature (25°C). Extra plugs can be made from the left-over cell suspensions, if desired.

Store plugs in tubes with 2-5 ml of plug wash TE buffer at 4°C until ready for restriction digestion. Plugs are usable for up to 4 months but it is preferable to use them as soon as possible after the washing step.

Restriction digestion

The restriction enzymes to use are dependent on the type of the bacteria being
tested. For _N. meningitidis_ use _Nhe_ I, and for _H. influenzae_ and _S.
pneumoniae_ use _Sma_ I. Note that for further resolution, isolates can be cut
with an additional enzyme, but do not cut with two enzymes in the same
reaction. This is useful if other molecular characterization such as MLST will
not be performed. _Spe_ I can also be used for _N. meningitidis_ and _Xma_ I
for _H. influenzae_ and _S. pneumoniae_.

Pour off the EtBr staining solution according to safety regulations and destain the gel with 500 ml cold deionized water for 30 min on the rotator. Remove water and repeat 2X.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6. Transfer the gel to an imaging system to photograph the image under UV light and save it on the computer as a tagged image file format (TIFF) file for further analysis. TIFF is the preferred format because of its greater resolution but the files can be saved as .jpeg if file size is a problem. If an imaging system is unavailable, a photo of the agarose gel can be taken.

Analysis of image and interpretation

Visual analysis can be used to directly compare the band patterns of a limited
number of isolates on a gel. However, several computer software programs have
been developed to analyze gel images, compare multiple gel images, match
banding patterns, construct dendrograms, and store gel data to allow for more
accurate and sophisticated data analyses. The banding patterns are analyzed
with the Dice coefficient, an optimization of 1.0%, and a position tolerance
of 1.5% for the band migration distance. A PFGE-based clonal group is defined
as a group of isolates with genetically related PFGE patterns. In general, the
PFGE patterns of strains categorized within a clonal group have six or fewer
differences from each other and ≥80% genetic relatedness on the dendrogram.
When comparing isolates associated with an outbreak, it is helpful to include
isolates that do not have an epidemiological link to the outbreak to determine
if the outbreak clone is currently circulating within the population or if it
has been recently introduced. After results are obtained using the software,
it is recommended that the results be visually compared to the bands on the
gel to be sure the results make sense.

For _S. pneumoniae_ , comparisons of PFGE profiles to those of major global
clones should be made by using the profiles described by the Pneumococcal
Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) or reference isolates can be requested
from this group to include in PFGE runs.

Technical considerations

Use of a standard

A standard or molecular weight size marker is used to provide an accurate
fragment size estimate and assists with normalization and correction of gel
patterns due to variations in electrophoresis. It should be included in each
gel run to allow for inter- and intra-gel comparison of isolates. A common
commercial marker is the lambda bacteriophage, which consists of concatamers
of the bacteriophage lambda DNA. This marker is available in both high
molecular weight and low molecular weight varieties and some laboratories use
both on a gel. However, inconsistency in the DNA concentration and quality of
the commercially available lambda ladders has been observed between vendors
and in lot-to-lot variation of the ladder. Alternatively, a bacterial strain
standard can be used that produces bands of known molecular weight. The
bacterial standard does not necessarily have to be of the same strain being
tested. The caveat with using a bacterial strain is that it must be prepared
in the lab and mutations or genomic rearrangements can occur to change a
cleavage site, thus changing the size of two or more of the bands. Regardless
of the type of marker used, 3 lanes of the gel spaced evenly apart, but not on
the edge of the gel, should be used for markers.

Care needs to be taken in the interpretation of results, especially in inter-
laboratory studies, as small differences in electrophoresis conditions can
alter the distance migrated by each band, complicating the comparison between
isolates in different gels.

Quality control

Quality control (QC) is a measure of precision and a way to ensure that test
results are correct, consistent and reproducible. Thus, QC for reagents used

Troubleshooting

Unexpected results can be attributed to equipment failure, incorrect
calculations, and improperly made reagents. When errors arise in an assay, it
is helpful to review the equipment, reagents, and steps used in the procedure
to look for errors. Listed below are some common problems encountered when
performing PFGE with suggestions on how to correct them.

Analysis of PCR products on an agarose gel

To check for a successful PCR amplification, run an aliquot of the end-
products on a 1% agarose gel.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1. Briefly spin the PCR plate or tubes at 500 x _g_ to ensure all liquid is at the bottom of the wells.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2. Mix 5 ml of PCR reaction with 1 ml of 6X loading dye (see Table 46 for protocol). It is important to include DNA size markers in one of the wells.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3. Make a 1% agarose gel. Add 1 g of electrophoresis grade agarose to 100 ml of 1X Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer (see below) in a 250 ml flask and melt the agarose in a microwave. Microwave for 1 min, swirl, and then microwave in 15 sec increments with swirling until the agarose is fully melted and the solution is clear. Be cautious as the molten agarose will be extremely hot. Once the agar has cooled to approximately 55°C add 1-2 µl of EtBr (see below) and swirl. Pour into a gel casting box, insert the comb, and allow time for hardening. Remove the comb after the gel has hardened.
