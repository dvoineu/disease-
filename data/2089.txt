## Summary

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disease that causes certain nerve
cells in the brain to waste away. People are born with the defective gene, but
symptoms usually don't appear until middle age. Early symptoms of HD may
include uncontrolled movements, clumsiness, and balance problems. Later, HD
can take away the ability to walk, talk, and swallow. Some people stop
recognizing family members. Others are aware of their environment and are able
to express emotions.

If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, you have a 50 percent chance
of getting it. A blood test can tell you if have the HD gene and will develop
the disease. Genetic counseling can help you weigh the risks and benefits of
taking the test.

There is no cure. Medicines can help manage some of the symptoms, but cannot
slow down or stop the disease.
