## Summary

The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the
large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has
no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The
blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and
inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and
spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.

The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is
usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include

    * Swelling in the abdomen
    * Loss of appetite
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Constipation or diarrhea
    * Inability to pass gas
    * Low fever 

Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.

Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Treatment almost always involves removing
the appendix. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people
10 to 30 years old.
