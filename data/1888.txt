## Summary

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) connects your jaw to the side of your head.
When it works well, it enables you to talk, chew, and yawn. For people with
TMJ dysfunction, problems with the joint and muscles around it may cause

    * Pain that travels through the face, jaw, or neck
    * Stiff jaw muscles
    * Limited movement or locking of the jaw 
    * Painful clicking or popping in the jaw 
    * A change in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together

Jaw pain may go away with little or no treatment. Treatment may include simple
things you can do yourself, such as eating soft foods or applying ice packs.
It may also include pain medicines or devices to insert in your mouth. In very
rare cases, you might need surgery.
