## Summary

Neuromuscular disorders affect your neuromuscular system. They can cause
problems with

    * The nerves that control your muscles
    * Your muscles
    * Communication between your nerves and muscles

These disorders can cause your muscles to become weak and waste away. You may
also have symptoms such as spasms, twitching, and pain.

Examples of neuromuscular disorders include

    * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
    * Muscular dystrophy
    * Myasthenia gravis
    * Spinal muscular atrophy

There can be different causes for these diseases. Many of them are
genetic.This means they are inherited (run in families) or are caused by a new
mutation in your genes. Some neuromuscular disorders are autoimmune diseases.
Sometimes the cause is unknown.

Many neuromuscular diseases have no cure. But treatments may improve symptoms,
increase mobility, and lengthen life.
