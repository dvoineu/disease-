## Summary

If you spend time outdoors, chances are you have been bothered by poison ivy,
poison oak or poison sumac at some point. Most people are sensitive to the
plants' oily sap. The sap is in the root, stems, leaves and fruit of these
plants. If it gets on your skin, it causes a blistering skin rash. The rash
can range from mild to severe, depending on how much sap gets on your skin and
how sensitive you are to it. Problems can also happen if the plants are
burned. Airborne sap-coated soot can get into the eyes, nose, throat and
respiratory system.

The best way to avoid the rash is to learn what the plants look like and stay
away from them. If you come into contact with the plants, wash your skin and
clothing right away. If you develop a rash, ask your pharmacist about over-
the-counter medicines. For severe rashes, see your doctor.
