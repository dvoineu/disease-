## Summary

Sinusitis means your sinuses are inflamed. The cause can be an infection or
another problem. Your sinuses are hollow air spaces within the bones
surrounding the nose. They produce mucus, which drains into the nose. If your
nose is swollen, this can block the sinuses and cause pain.

There are several types of sinusitis, including

  * Acute, which lasts up to 4 weeks
  * Subacute, which lasts 4 to 12 weeks
  * Chronic, which lasts more than 12 weeks and can continue for months or even years
  * Recurrent, with several attacks within a year

Acute sinusitis often starts as a cold, which then turns into a bacterial
infection. Allergies, nasal problems, and certain diseases can also cause
acute and chronic sinusitis.

Symptoms of sinusitis can include fever, weakness, fatigue, cough, and
congestion. There may also be mucus drainage in the back of the throat, called
postnasal drip. Your health care professional diagnoses sinusitis based on
your symptoms and an examination of your nose and face. You may also need
imaging tests. Treatments include antibiotics, decongestants, and pain
relievers. Using heat pads on the inflamed area, saline nasal sprays, and
vaporizers can also help.
