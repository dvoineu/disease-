## Summary

All kids misbehave some times. And some may have temporary behavior problems
due to stress. For example, the birth of a sibling, a divorce, or a death in
the family may cause a child to act out. Behavior disorders are more serious.
They involve a pattern of hostile, aggressive, or disruptive behaviors for
more than 6 months. The behavior is also not appropriate for the child's age.

Warning signs can include

    * Harming or threatening themselves, other people or pets
    * Damaging or destroying property 
    * Lying or stealing 
    * Not doing well in school, skipping school 
    * Early smoking, drinking or drug use 
    * Early sexual activity 
    * Frequent tantrums and arguments 
    * Consistent hostility toward authority figures 

If you see signs of a problem, ask for help. Poor choices can become habits.
Kids who have behavior problems are at higher risk for school failure, mental
health problems, and even suicide. Classes or family therapy may help parents
learn to set and enforce limits. Talk therapy and behavior therapy for your
child can also help.
