###

The use of culture-independent diagnostic tests to diagnose intestinal
bacterial infections commonly transmitted by food is on the rise.

The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, or FoodNet, has been
tracking trends for infections transmitted commonly through food since 1996.

FoodNet provides a foundation for food safety policy and prevention efforts.
It estimates the number of foodborne illnesses, monitors trends in incidence
of specific foodborne illnesses over time, attributes illnesses to specific
foods and settings, and disseminates this information.
