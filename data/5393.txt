## Clinical Presentation

A wide clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection has been reported ranging from
asymptomatic infection to acute upper respiratory illness, and rapidly
progressive pneumonitis, respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ
failure resulting in death. Most MERS-CoV cases have been reported in adults
(median age approximately 50 years, male predominance), although children and
adults of all ages have been infected (range 0 to 109 years). Most
hospitalized MERS-CoV patients have had chronic co-morbidities. Among
confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to date, the case fatality proportion is
approximately 35%.

Limited clinical data for MERS-CoV patients are available; most published
clinical information to date is from critically ill patients. At hospital
admission, common signs and symptoms include fever, chills/rigors, headache,
non-productive cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. Other symptoms can include sore
throat, coryza, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, sputum production, diarrhea,
and abdominal pain. Atypical presentations including mild respiratory illness
without fever and diarrheal illness preceding development of pneumonia have
been reported. Patients who progress to requiring admission to an intensive
care unit (ICU) often have a history of a febrile upper respiratory tract
illness with rapid progression to pneumonia within a week of illness onset.

Also see People Who May Be at Increased Risk for MERS.



## Clinical Course

The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited
human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In
MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is
approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset
to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median
time from onset to death is approximately 12 days. In one series of 12 ICU
patients, the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 16 days, and
median ICU length of stay was 30 days, with 58% mortality at 90 days.
Radiographic findings may include unilateral or bilateral patchy densities or
opacities, interstitial infiltrates, consolidation, and pleural effusions.
Rapid progression to acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), refractory hypoxemia, and extrapulmonary complications (acute
kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy, hypotension requiring
vasopressors, hepatic inflammation, septic shock) has been reported.

## Laboratory Findings

Laboratory findings at admission may include leukopenia, lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Co-infection with
other respiratory viruses and a few cases of co-infection with community-
acquired bacteria at admission has been reported; nosocomial bacterial and
fungal infections have been reported in mechanically-ventilated patients.
MERS-CoV virus can be detected with higher viral load and longer duration in
the lower respiratory tract compared to the upper respiratory tract, and has
been detected in feces, serum, and urine.

Duration of MERS-CoV shedding in the respiratory tract is typically longer in
more severely ill patients than mildly ill patients, and evidence of virus has
been detected in survivors for a month or more after onset. Limited data are
available on the duration of extrapulmonary MERS-CoV shedding.

Specimens.



## Clinical Management and Treatment

No specific treatment for MERS-CoV infection is currently available. Clinical
management includes supportive management of complications and implementation
of recommended infection prevention and control measures. For more
information, see the World Health Organization guidance for clinical
management of severe acute respiratory syndrome when MERS-CoV infection is
