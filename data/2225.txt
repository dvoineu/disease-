upon your age, gender, and sexual orientation. Women who are pregnant have
additional testing and vaccination options.  
In order to provide you with tailored testing and vaccination options,
questions about age, gender, and sexual orientation help to provide
appropriate suggestions for your care. You should always consult with your
