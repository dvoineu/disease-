To date, we don't fully understand the pathogenic potential and transmission
dynamics of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Until
more information becomes available, precautions should be taken in collecting
and handling specimens that may contain MERS-CoV. Timely communication between
clinical and laboratory staff is essential to minimize the risk incurred in
handling specimens from patients with possible MERS-CoV infection. Such
specimens should be labeled accordingly, and the laboratory should be alerted
to ensure proper specimen handling. General and specific biosafety guidelines
for handling MERS-CoV specimens are provided below.

##  General Guidelines (for working with potentially infectious materials)

Laboratory workers should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) which
includes disposable gloves, laboratory coat/gown, respirator, and eye
protection when handling potentially infectious specimens.

Acceptable respiratory protection devices include: a properly fit-tested,
NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirator (N-95 or higher level) or a
powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) equipped with high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters. Accurate fit-testing is a key component of a
respiratory protection program (RPP) and will assist with effective respirator
use. An RPP includes medical clearance, training, fit-testing, and fit-
checking to ensure appropriate respiratory selection and use. To be effective,
respirators must provide a proper sealing surface on the wearer's face.
Personnel who cannot wear fitted respirators because of facial hair or other
fit limitations should wear loose-fitting hooded or helmeted PAPRs. See
detailed information on a respiratory protection programexternal icon.

Any procedure with the potential to generate fine-particulate aerosols (e.g.,
vortexing or sonication of specimens in an open tube) should be performed in a
Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC). Appropriate physical containment
devices (e.g., centrifuge safety buckets; sealed rotors) should be used for
centrifugation. Ideally, rotors and buckets should be loaded and unloaded in a
BSC. Perform any procedures outside a BSC in a manner that minimizes the risk
of exposure to an inadvertent sample release.

After specimens are processed, decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with
appropriate disinfectants. Use any EPA-registered hospital disinfectant.
Follow manufacturer's recommendations for use-dilution (i.e., concentration),
contact time, and care in handling.

All disposable waste should be autoclaved.

##  Clinical Laboratory Testing

Clinical laboratories performing routine hematology, urinalysis, and clinical
chemistry studies, and microbiology laboratories performing diagnostic tests
on serum, blood, or urine specimens should follow standard laboratory
practices, including Standard Precautions, when handling potential MERS-CoV
specimens. For additional information, see Biosafety in Microbiological and
Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) - Fifth Edition (page 225).

##  Packing, Shipping and Transport

Packaging, shipping, and transport of specimens from suspect cases of MERS-CoV
infection must follow the current edition of the International Air Transport
Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulationsexternal icon.

Follow shipping regulations for UN 3373 Biological Substance, Category B when
sending potential MERS-CoV specimens.
