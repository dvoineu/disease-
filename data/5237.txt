# Collecting & Submitting Specimens At Time of Birth for Zika Virus Testing

## General Information

Laboratory testing for congenital Zika virus infection is recommended for
infants born to mothers with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection
during pregnancy, and for infants who have abnormal clinical findings
suggestive of congenital Zika virus syndrome and a maternal epidemiologic link
suggesting possible transmission, regardless of maternal Zika virus test
results.

For infants born to mothers with risk factors for maternal Zika virus
infection (travel to or residence in an area with risk of Zika virus
transmission or sex with a partner with travel to or residence in such an
area) for whom maternal testing was not performed before delivery, assessment
of the infant, including comprehensive physical exam and careful measurement
of head circumference, neurologic assessment as well as newborn hearing screen
should be performed. In addition, based on the level of possible maternal Zika
virus exposure (e.g., duration and type of exposure, use of prevention
measures, intensity of Zika virus transmission at the location of travel), the
provider should consider whether further evaluation of the newborn for
possible congenital Zika virus infection is warranted, in which case a head
ultrasound and ophthalmologic assessment should be considered. Based on
results of the evaluation, testing of the infant for Zika virus infection
could be considered.

Testing of placental tissue specimens by Zika virus reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is conducted at CDC's Infectious Diseases
Pathology Branch (IDPB). Zika virus RT-PCR on placental tissues from women
with possible Zika virus exposure can be considered for diagnostic purposes
for symptomatic pregnant women and women with infants with possible Zika
virus-associated birth defects without a definitive diagnosis of laboratory-
confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy. For asymptomatic pregnant
women who have recent possible Zika virus exposure but without ongoing
possible exposure, similar to the updated recommendations for testing of non-
tissue clinical specimens (e.g., serum and urine), testing of placental
tissues is not routinely recommended.

**IMPORTANT: Pre-approval is _required_ prior to submission of any tissue
specimens. For pre-approval please contact **pathology@cdc.gov **.**
