## Summary

Voice is the sound made by air passing from your lungs through your larynx, or
voice box. In your larynx are your vocal cords, two bands of muscle that
vibrate to make sound. For most of us, our voices play a big part in who we
are, what we do, and how we communicate. Like fingerprints, each person's
voice is unique.

Many things we do can injure our vocal cords. Talking too much, screaming,
constantly clearing your throat, or smoking can make you hoarse. They can also
lead to problems such as nodules, polyps, and sores on the vocal cords. Other
causes of voice disorders include infections, upward movement of stomach acids
into the throat, growths due to a virus, cancer, and diseases that paralyze
the vocal cords.

Signs that your voice isn't healthy include

    * Your voice has become hoarse or raspy
    * You've lost the ability to hit some high notes when singing
    * Your voice suddenly sounds deeper
    * Your throat often feels raw, achy, or strained
    * It's become an effort to talk

Treatment for voice disorders varies depending on the cause. Most voice
problems can be successfully treated when diagnosed early.
