## Summary

The products you use for cleaning, carpentry, auto repair, gardening, and many
other household uses can contain ingredients that can harm you, your family,
and the environment. These include

    * Oven and drain cleaners
    * Laundry powder
    * Floor polish
    * Paint thinners, strippers and removers
    * Pesticides
    * Grease and rust removers
    * Motor oil and fuel additives
    * Arts and craft supplies

Toxic substances in these products can cause harm if inhaled, swallowed, or
absorbed through the skin. People respond to toxic substances in different
ways. At high doses a toxic substance might cause birth defects or other
serious problems, including brain damage or death.

To avoid problems, keep products in the containers they come in and use them
exactly as the label says. Follow label directions or get medical help if you
swallow, inhale or get them on your skin.
