Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn is a bleeding disorder in
babies. It most often develops in the first days and weeks of life.

## Causes

A lack of vitamin K may cause severe bleeding in newborn babies. Vitamin K
plays an important role in blood clotting.

Babies often have a low level of vitamin K for a variety of reasons. Vitamin K
does not move easily across the placenta from the mother to the baby. As a
result, a newborn does not have much vitamin K stored up at birth. Also, the
bacteria that help make vitamin K are not yet present in a newborn's
gastrointestinal tract. Finally, there is not much vitamin K in mother's milk.

Your baby may develop this condition if:

    * A preventive vitamin K shot is not given at birth (if vitamin K is given by mouth instead of as a shot, it must be given more than once, and it does not appear to be as effective as the shot).
    * You take certain anti-seizure or blood-thinning drugs.

The condition is grouped into three categories:

    * Early-onset VKDB is very rare. It occurs during the first hours after birth and within 24 hours. Use of anti-seizure medicines or some other medicines, including a blood thinner called Coumadin, during pregnancy is a common cause.
    * Classic onset disease occurs between 24 hours and 7 days after birth. It may be seen in breastfed infants who did not receive a vitamin K shot within the first week after birth, such as those for whom feedings were delayed initially. It is also rare.
    * Late-onset VKDB is seen in infants between 2 weeks and 2 months old. It is more common in children who did not receive a vitamin K shot.

Newborns and infants with the following problems involving the
gastrointestinal system are more likely to develop this disorder:

    * Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency
    * Biliary atresia
    * Celiac disease
    * Cystic fibrosis
    * Diarrhea
    * Hepatitis

## Symptoms

The condition causes bleeding. The most common areas of bleeding include:

    * A boy's penis, if he has been circumcised
    * Belly button area
    * Gastrointestinal tract (may result in blood in the baby's bowel movements)
    * Mucus membranes (such as the lining of the nose and mouth)
    * Places where there has been a needle stick 

There may also be:

    * Blood in the urine
    * Bruising
    * Seizures (convulsions) or abnormal behavior 

## Exams and Tests

Blood clotting tests will be done.

The diagnosis is confirmed if a vitamin K shot stops the bleeding and blood
clotting time (prothrombin time) quickly becomes normal. (In vitamin K
deficiency, the prothrombin time is abnormal.)

## Treatment

Vitamin K is given if bleeding occurs.Â Babies with severe bleeding may need
plasma or blood transfusions.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook tends to be worse for babies with late-onset hemorrhagic disease
than other forms. There is a higher rate of bleeding inside the skull
(intracranial hemorrhage) associated with the late-onset condition.

## Possible Complications

Complications may include:

    * Bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage), with possible brain damage
    * Death

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if your baby has any unexplained bleeding,
seizures, or abnormal behavior. Get emergency medical care right away if the
symptoms are severe.

## Prevention

The early onset form of the disease may be prevented by giving vitamin K shots
to pregnant women who take anti-seizure medications. To prevent the classic
and late-onset forms, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving
every baby a shot of vitamin K immediately after birth. Because of this
practice, vitamin K deficiency is now rare in the US except for those babies
who do not receive the vitamin K shot.

## Alternative Names

Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN)
