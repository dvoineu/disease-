## Summary

Food or small objects can cause choking if they get caught in your throat and
block your airway. This keeps oxygen from getting to your lungs and brain. If
your brain goes without oxygen for more than four minutes, you could have
brain damage or die.

Young children are at an especially high risk of choking. They can choke on
foods like hot dogs, nuts and grapes, and on small objects like toy pieces and
coins. Keep hazards out of their reach and supervise them when they eat.

When someone is choking, quick action can be lifesaving. Learn how to do back
blows, the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts), and CPR.
