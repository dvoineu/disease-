## Summary

Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car
emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be
suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in
cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog.

Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance
you'll have health problems. People with heart or lung disease, older adults
and children are at greater risk from air pollution. Air pollution isn't just
outside - the air inside buildings can also be polluted and affect your
health.
