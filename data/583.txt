## Summary

The uterus, or womb, is the place where a baby grows when a women is pregnant.
There are different types of uterine cancer. The most common type starts in
the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. This type is also called
endometrial cancer.

The symptoms of uterine cancer include

    * Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge
    * Trouble urinating
    * Pelvic pain
    * Pain during intercourse

Uterine cancer usually happens after menopause. It is more common in women who
have obesity. You also have a higher risk if you took estrogen-only hormone
replacement therapy (menopausal hormone therapy) for many years.

Tests to find uterine cancer include a pelvic exam, imaging tests, and a
biopsy. The most common treatment is a hysterectomy, which is surgery to
remove the uterus. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and
fallopian tubes. Other treatments include hormone therapy, radiation therapy,
and chemotherapy. Some women get more than one type of treatment.
