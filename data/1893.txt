## Summary

Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are
developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new
skills. The normal development of children aged 1-3 includes several areas:

    * Gross motor - walking, running, climbing
    * Fine motor - feeding themselves, drawing
    * Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling
    * Language - saying single words, then sentences
    * Social - playing with others, taking turns, doing fantasy play

Toddlers do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is
considered "normal." Your child may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind
in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your child's
health care provider.
