## Summary

Your connective tissue supports many different parts of your body, such as
your skin, eyes, and heart. It is like a "cellular glue" that gives your body
parts their shape and helps keep them strong. It also helps some of your
tissues do their work. It is made of many kinds of proteins. Cartilage and fat
are types of connective tissue.

Over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue. There are different types:

    * Genetic disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta
    * Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus and scleroderma
    * Cancers, like some types of soft tissue sarcoma

Each disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment.
