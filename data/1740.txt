###  Overview

Primary themes in the NIOSH job stress research program:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1. To better understand the influence of what are commonly-termed "work organization" or "psychosocial" factors on stress, illness, and injury
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2.

###  Job Stress and NORA

In 1996, NIOSH established an interdisciplinary team of researchers and
practitioners from industry, labor, and academia to develop a national
research agenda on the "organization of work." Work organization refers to
management and supervisory practices, to production processes, and to their
influence on the way work is performed. (In this sense, the study of work
organization and health subsumes the field of job stress.) This initiative is
part of a broader, collaborative effort by NIOSH external partners to
spearhead a "National Occupational Research Agenda" (NORA) to guide
occupational safety and health research into the future, not only for NIOSH,
but for the entire U.S. occupational safety and health community. During its
tenure, the organization of work team has conferred with academic, industry,
and labor stakeholders to identify essential research and other requirements
to better understand how work organization is changing, the safety and health
implications of these changes, and prevention measures. This effort culminated
in the NIOSH report "The Changing Organization of Work and the Safety and
Health of Working People."
