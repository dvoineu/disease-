## Summary

Fear and anxiety are part of life. You may feel anxious before you take a test
or walk down a dark street. This kind of anxiety is useful - it can make you
more alert or careful. It usually ends soon after you are out of the situation
that caused it. But for millions of people in the United States, the anxiety
does not go away, and gets worse over time. They may have chest pains or
nightmares. They may even be afraid to leave home. These people have anxiety
disorders. Types include

    * Panic disorder
    * Obsessive-compulsive disorder
    * Post-traumatic stress disorder
    * Phobias
    * Generalized anxiety disorder 

Treatment can involve medicines, therapy or both.
