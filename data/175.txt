## Summary

Keeping a healthy weight is crucial. If you are underweight or overweight, or
have obesity, you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.

About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or have obesity.
Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood
pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related
diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.

Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you
overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat must equal the
energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat. A
weight-control strategy might include

  * Choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods
  * Eating smaller portions
  * Drinking water instead of sugary drinks
  * Being physically active

Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight.
