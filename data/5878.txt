### Environmental Health

![map icon for Connecticut](/nceh/information/state_factsheets/CT.jpg)

Your environment is everything around you--the air you breathe, the water you
drink, the community around you, the places where your food is grown or
prepared, your workplace, and your home. When your environment is safe and
healthy, you are more likely to stay healthy. But when your environment
exposes you to dangerous events or toxic substances, your health can be
affected negatively.

CDC is committed to saving lives and protecting people from environmental
hazards by responding to natural and man-made disasters, supporting public
health workers, educating communities, and providing scientific knowledge. We
help maintain and improve the health of Americans by promoting a healthy
environment and preventing premature death and avoidable illness caused by
environmental and related factors. We also identify how people might be
exposed to hazardous substances in the environment and assess exposures to
determine if they are hazardous to human health. CDC invests in prevention to
improve health and save money by reducing healthcare costs. We remain
committed to maximizing the impact of every dollar entrusted to the agency.

### Funded Activities

Asthma

In Connecticut, asthma is a growing problem for kids and adults. From 2000 to
2010, the number of adults with asthma rose by almost 18%.

From: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/contacts/factsheets/Asthma-
Connecticut_final.pdf Cdc-pdf[PDF - 415 KB]

Asthma is a common disease on the rise, with significant health disparities
and associated healthcare costs. Nearly 1 in 12 Americans (26 million) have
asthma. In the last decade, the proportion of people with asthma, grew by
nearly 15%.

CDC has been working with states for more than 10 years to implement
community-based interventions, build local coalitions, and track the impact of
the disease on the U.S. population.

The program focuses on what works to control asthma: assessing and measuring
changes in disease severity and control, using the right medications,
educating people to manage their conditions, and controlling environmental
irritants and allergens.

Even though the number of people with asthma has increased over the last 10
years, trends show that more are controlling their disease:

**Lead Poisoning Prevention Program**

(FY 2011 funding for Connecticut--$593,000; because of funding reductions, the
program was discontinued in 2012. Some funding was restored in FY 2014. States
will be recompeting for funding and more information will be available later
in the year.)

More than 12 million U.S. children are exposed to lead in their homes at
levels that can harm their intellectual development. No safe blood lead level
in children has been identified.

Reducing children's lead exposure is perhaps the greatest environmental health
accomplishment in the past 20 years.

For more than 20 years, CDC funded state and local health agencies to

Children who are exposed to lead lose $3,000 to almost $8,000 in lifetime
productivity for each 1 microgram per deciliter (μg/dL) increase in blood lead
level. Blood lead levels over 1 μg/dL are associated with measurable
reductions in IQ.

Between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, interventions that control or eliminate lead
hazards before children are exposed (primary prevention) helped reduce the
number of children exposed to lead (blood lead levels ≥ 1μg/dL) by nearly 3
million, saving $26-57 billion in lifetime productivity earnings alone. These
estimates do not account for behavioral and other adverse effects on lifetime
productivity linked to lead.

**Environmental Public Health Tracking Program**

(FY 2013 funding for Connecticut--$469,000. A new funding announcement has
been released; FY 2014 funding information will be available later in the
year.)

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 25% of all diseases
are caused by environmental exposures. Some of these diseases--such as cancer,
asthma, and cardiovascular disease--are the greatest killers today.

CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) is a
dynamic web-based tool that tracks and reports environmental hazards and the
health problems that may be related to them.

The Tracking Network's integrated health, environmental exposure, and hazard
information is used to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Identify interventions and programs to reduce or prevent health effects from environmental exposures.

Since 2005, the Tracking Network has led to at least 160 public health
interventions that prevent or control potential health effects from
environmental exposures.

About 15% of households in the United States get their drinking water from
private wells and other unregulated sources where little is known about the
quality of water.

### Public Health in Action

**Asthma Control in Connecticut**

CDC supports the Putting on AIRS (Asthma Indoor Risk Strategies) Program
through which asthma prevention specialists provide one-on-one education and
environmental assessments to asthma patients and their families in their
homes. The program empowers families with knowledge and tools to control
asthma. In three years, Putting on AIRS and its local partners have reached
600 Connecticut families. Health officials report the effort decreased asthma-
related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and school absences.
For every 100 program participants, the state saves about $26,000 in acute
care costs.

**Tracking Asthma in Connecticut**

Asthma is a continuing concern for many Connecticut residents, especially
those living in urban areas. Tracking the rates of hospital stays due to
asthma is crucial to assessing the success of public health strategies. The
Connecticut Tracking Program developed a part of the state tracking network
just for asthma. With data from the state asthma program and hospitals, users
can view real-time rates for asthma-related hospital stays by ethnicity,
gender, race, and county. (See https://stateofhealth.ct.gov/AsthmaExternal)

Thanks to the Connecticut Tracking Program, complete user-friendly asthma data
for the state are available in one place for the first time. Other health
department programs now have access to asthma data that can help them evaluate
their asthma prevention and control activities in less time.

**Safe Water in Connecticut**

Connecticut users of private wells and other unregulated sources of water may
know little about the quality of their water. Private water wells in the
United States can have unsafe levels of radon, arsenic, uranium, manganese,
fluoride, nitrates, or bacteria. CDC's Private Well Initiative helps well
owners ensure the safety of their water.

CDC gives the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH) nearly $70,000 to
partner with local health departments to collect water data from across the
state. CDPH is starting with basic information, such as the number of private
water wells in the state and their locations. CDPH will then use this
information to provide guidance to the public on testing their wells.

**Lead Poisoning Prevention in Connecticut ***

The following describes activities carried out in in previous years with the
support of CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program when it was fully funded:

CDC funding of Connecticut's Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control Program
(LPPCP) supported surveillance on blood lead level testing, monitoring of the
accreditation and certification of lead professionals, and local health
departments' lead prevention activities.

Surveillance of blood lead results allows the state to identify high-risk
communities. For example, in 2009, black and Hispanic children in urban areas
were found to have the highest percentages of elevated blood lead levels in
Connecticut. LPPCP has supported local health departments and two Regional
Lead Treatment Centers to conduct health promotion, prevention, and response
activities. LPPCP
