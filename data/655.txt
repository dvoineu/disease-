## Summary

### What is itching?

Itching is an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch your skin.
Sometimes it can feel like pain, but it is different. Often, you feel itchy in
one area in your body, but sometimes you may feel itching all over. Along with
the itching, you may also have a rash or hives.

### What causes itching?

Itching is a symptom of many health conditions. Some common causes are

    * Allergic reactions to food, insect bites, pollen, and medicines
    * Skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and dry skin
    * Irritating chemicals, cosmetics, and other substances
    * Parasites such as pinworms, scabies, head and body lice
    * Pregnancy
    * Liver, kidney, or thyroid diseases
    * Certain cancers or cancer treatments
    * Diseases that can affect the nervous system, such as diabetes and shingles

### What are the treatments for itching?

Most itching is not serious. To feel better, you could try

    * Applying cold compresses
    * Using moisturizing lotions
    * Taking lukewarm or oatmeal baths
    * Using over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or antihistamines
    * Avoiding scratching, wearing irritating fabrics, and exposure to high heat and humidity

Contact your health care provider if your itching is severe, does not go away
after a few weeks, or does not have an apparent cause. You may need other
treatments, such as medicines or light therapy. If you have an underlying
disease that is causing the itching, treating that disease may help.
