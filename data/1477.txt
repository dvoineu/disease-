Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics,
subtropics, and southern Europe. It is classified as a neglected tropical
disease (NTD). Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with _Leishmania_
parasites, which are spread by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. There are
several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. The most common forms are
**cutaneous leishmaniasis** , which causes skin sores, and **visceral
leishmaniasis** , which affects several internal organs (usually spleen,
liver, and bone marrow).

Image: On average, the sand flies that transmit _Leishmania_ are only about
one-fourth the size of mosquitoes or even smaller. Left: Example of a vector
sand fly ( _Phlebotomus papatasi_ ) with a visible blood meal. Right:
_Leishmania_ promastigotes from a culture. The flagellated promastigote stage
of the parasite is found in sand flies and in cultures. Credit: PHIL, DPDx
