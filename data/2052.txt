## Summary

The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. Women have two
ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and
shape of an almond.

The ovaries produce and store a woman's eggs. During ovulation, an ovary
releases an egg. If that egg is fertilized by a sperm, a pregnancy can occur.
Ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. When a woman
goes through menopause, her ovaries stop making those hormones and releasing
eggs.

Problems with the ovaries include

    * Ovarian cancer
    * Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome
    * Primary ovarian insufficiency
    * Ovarian torsion, a twisting of the ovary
