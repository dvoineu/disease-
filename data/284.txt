## Summary

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a leading
cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking
causes most lung cancers. The more cigarettes you smoke per day and the
earlier you started smoking, the greater your risk of lung cancer. High levels
of pollution, radiation and asbestos exposure may also increase risk.

Common symptoms of lung cancer include

  * A cough that doesn't go away and gets worse over time
  * Constant chest pain
  * Coughing up blood
  * Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness
  * Repeated problems with pneumonia or bronchitis
  * Swelling of the neck and face
  * Loss of appetite or weight loss
  * Fatigue

Doctors diagnose lung cancer using a physical exam, imaging, and lab tests.
Treatment depends on the type, stage, and how advanced it is. Treatments
include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer
cells with less harm to normal cells.
