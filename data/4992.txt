![Once children outgrow their forward-facing seat, they should be buckled in a
belt positioning booster seat until seat belts fit properly. Seat belts fit
properly when the lap belt lays across the upper thighs \(not the stomach\)
and the shoulder belt lays across the chest \(not the neck\). Proper seat belt
fit usually occurs when children are about 4 feet 9 inches tall and age 9-12
years.](/traumaticbraininjury/images/cps_2018_09_booster-seat.png)

### After outgrowing forward-facing seat and until seat belts fit properly.

![Children no longer need to use a booster seat once seat belts fit them
properly. Seat belts fit properly when the lap belt lays across the upper
thighs \(not the stomach\) and the shoulder belt lays across the chest \(not
the neck\). Proper seat belt fit usually occurs when children are about 4 feet
9 inches tall and age 9-12 years. For the best possible protection, keep
children properly buckled in the back
seat.](/traumaticbraininjury/images/cps_2018_09_seat-belt.png)

### Once seat belts fit properly without a booster seat.

![All children aged 12 and under should ride in the back seat. Airbags can
kill young children riding in the front seat. Never place a rear-facing car
seat in the front seat or in front of an air
bag.](/traumaticbraininjury/images/CPS_Remember.png)
