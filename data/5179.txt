When people in a large area are getting sick or when large numbers of
mosquitoes are found, airplanes can be used to treat very large areas with
insecticides safely, quickly, and efficiently. This process is called aerial
spraying. Below is more information on aerial spraying.

## Aerial Spraying and Mosquito Control

**Is aerial spraying an effective tool for killing mosquitoes?**

Aerial treatment of areas with products that rapidly reduce both adult
mosquitoes and their larvae that carry the Zika virus can be effective.
Repeated aerial applications of insecticide has reduced mosquito populations
as a part of an integrated mosquito management program.

**Is aerial spraying alone the best way to control mosquitoes?**

## Aerial Spraying and Organic Farming



**Is Bti harmful to crops?**

Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When
used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes
lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-
registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings.
Organic farming operations use Bti.

**Is Bti harmful to crops or water supplies?**

Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When
used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes
lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-
registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings.
Organic farming operations use Bti.

Multiple Bti products are available for use. Some can be used by pest control
professionals in certain drinking water storage containers (e.g., cisterns)
while others are not EPA-registered for that use. Always follow label
instructions. It is important to follow the label for any Bti product to
ensure that the product is being used correctly.
