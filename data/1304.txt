**United States Cancer Statistics: Data Visualizations**  
The U. S. Cancer Statistics Data Visualizations tool provides information on
the numbers and rates of new cancer cases and deaths at the national, state,
and county levels. You can see the numbers by sex, age, race and ethnicity,
trends over time, survival, and prevalence. Text explains what is shown on
each chart and graph.

**CDC WONDER**  
This online query system lets you see age-adjusted and crude cancer rates in
tabs, maps, and charts. It includes data on adult and childhood cancers by
geographic region.

**State Cancer Profiles external icon**  
You can use State Cancer Profiles to view rates of new cancers at a county
level, including a description of trends to see if rates are stable, falling,
or rising in your area.

**Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE)** external icon  
SAHIE provides data publications, interactive visualizations, and maps to help
identify areas with high rates of uninsured and under-insured people so
programs can target those in greatest need.

**Sortable Stats**  
Get national and state-level colorectal cancer screening rates by race,
ethnicity, and sex.

**Disability and Health Data System**  
Provides state-level health and demographic data about people with
disabilities.

## Databases Available to Researchers

**United States Cancer Statistics: Public Use Databases**  
As a researcher, you can analyze population-based incidence data on the entire
United States population with these public use databases.

**United States Cancer Statistics: Restricted Access Data**  
This database includes variables that are not in the public use database,
including county at diagnosis, site-specific factors, and prognostic measures.
The database is available through CDC's National Center for Health Statistics
Research Data Center.
