authority, i.e., they may be released at any time based on the management
needs of the organization.

## Salary Offset

Normally, under the laws governing the CSRS and FERS, a reemployed annuitant's
salary is offset (reduced) by an amount equal to their annuity. There are
exceptions, discussed below.

**Salary Offset Waivers**

CDC may grant a waiver of the normally required salary offset, also known as a
dual compensation reduction waiver. This allows the annuitant to be employed
without a salary reduction using the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA).

**NDAA Waiver Authority**

The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) revised the laws governing
the reemployment of annuitants under CSRS (5 U.S.C. 8344 (l) and FERS (5
U.S.C. 8468 (i) to create an additional dual-compensation waiver authority for
agencies.

Under this authority, agencies may reemploy retired annuitants without a
salary offset to fulfill functions critical to the agency mission, promote
appropriate training or mentoring, assist in the employment and retention of
employees, and other uses specified in the law. The following conditions
apply:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * There are no specific grade or series limitations associated with this authority

appointment is only 6 months with a 520-hour limitation. The appointment can
be extended for an additional 6 months with 520 hours, totaling 1040 hours per
year. After this initial year, extensions are allowed up to one-year
increments.

## Types of Positions

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) does not limit position types used
for reemployed annuitant authorities. However, there are limitations under
NDAA with the dual-compensation waiver, which are positions critical to the
agency mission, promote appropriate training or mentoring, assist in the
employment and retention of employees, and other uses specified in the law.
Agencies decide the position types to be filled based on mission needs.
Positions can be domestic or international assignments.

CDC position types are in the following OPM occupational groups:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * 0000 - Miscellaneous Occupations Groupexternal icon

## Other Considerations

A reemployed annuitant serves at the will of the agency regardless of the type
or length of appointment to which they are appointed. This means that a
reemployed annuitant's appointment may be terminated at any time without
regard to reduction-in-force or adverse action procedures. However, if there
is a need for the agency to conduct a formal reduction-in-force (RIF) and the
agency does not separate reemployed annuitants before the RIF effective date,
the reemployed annuitant competes in the RIF on the same basis as other
employees holding the same type of appointment.
