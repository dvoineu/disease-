An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually
not harmful.

## Causes

Allergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both
your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you have them, too.

The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such
as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called
allergens. These are usually harmless and in most people do not cause a
problem.

![Allergic reactions](//medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19150.jpg)

In a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it
recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such
as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.

video about:Allergies

Common allergens include:

    * Drugs
    * Dust
    * Food
    * Insect venom
    * Mold
    * Pet and other animal dander
    * Pollen 

Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight,
or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly
stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.

Allergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema,
and asthma, worse.

## Symptoms

Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches affects what symptoms you
develop. For example:

    * Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, andÂ wheezing.
    * Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes.
    * Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction.
    * Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or skin peeling.
    * Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms. 

At times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body.

## Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such
as when the allergy occurs.

Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual
allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food
(food poisoning) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines
(such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including
rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection.

Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing:

    * The prick test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substances on the skin, and then slightly pricking the area so the substance moves under the skin. The skin is closely watched for signs of a reaction, which include swelling and redness.
    * The intradermal test involves injecting tiny amount of allergen under your skin, then watching the skin for a reaction.
    * Both the prick and intradermal tests are read 15 minutes after application of the test.
    * The patch test involves placing a patch with the suspected allergen on your skin. The skin is then closely watched for signs of a reaction. This test is used to determine contact allergy. It is usually read 48 to 72 hours after application of the test. 

The doctor may also check your reaction to physical triggers by applying heat,
cold, or other stimulation to your body and watching for an allergic response.

Blood tests that may be done include:

    * Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which measures levels of allergy-related substances
    * Complete blood count (CBC) during which an eosinophil white blood cell count is done 

In some cases, the doctor may tell you to avoid certain items to see if you
get better, or to use suspected items to see if you feel worse. This is called
"use or elimination testing." This is often used to check for food or medicine
allergies.

## Treatment

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) need to be treated with a medicine
called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use
epinephrine, call 911 and go straight to the hospital.

The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This
is especially important for food and drug allergies.

There are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which
medicine your doctor recommends depends on the type and severity of your
symptoms, your age, and overall health.

Illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema)
may need other treatments.

![Introduction to allergy
treatment](//medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19335.jpg)

Medicines that can be used to treat allergies include:

ANTIHISTAMINES

Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are
available in many forms, including:

    * Capsules and pills
    * Eye drops
    * Injection
    * Liquid
    * Nasal spray 

CORTICOSTEROIDS

These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms,
including:

    * Creams and ointment for the skin
    * Eye drops
    * Nasal spray
    * Lung inhaler
    * Pills
    * Injection 

Persons with severe allergic symptoms may be prescribed corticosteroid pills
or injections for short periods.

DECONGESTANTS

Decongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray
for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make
the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem.
People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement
should use decongestants with caution.

OTHER MEDICINES

Leukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger
allergies. Person with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be
prescribed these medicines.

ALLERGY SHOTS

Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid
the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your
body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of
the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum
dose is reached. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to
visit the doctor often.

SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)

Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass, ragweed,
and dust mite allergies.

## Support Groups

Ask your provider if there are any asthma and allergy support groups in your
area.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Most allergies can be easily treated with medicine.

Some children may outgrow an allergy, especially food allergies. But once a
substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it usually continues to affect
the person.

Allergy shots are most effective when used to treat hay fever and insect sting
allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of
a severe reaction.

Allergy shots may need years of treatment, but they work in most cases.
However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash)
and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis). Talk with your provider whether
allergy drops (SLIT) are right for you.

## Possible Complications

Complications that may result from allergies or their treatment include:

    * Anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction)
    * Breathing problems and discomfort during the allergic reaction
    * Drowsiness and other side effects of medicines 

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your provider if:

    * Severe symptoms of allergy occur
    * Treatment for allergies no longer works

## Prevention

Breastfeeding can help prevent or decrease allergies when you feed babies this
way only for 4 to 6 months. However, changing a mother's diet during pregnancy
or while breastfeeding does not seem to help prevent allergies.

For most children, changing the diet or using special formulas does not seem
to prevent allergies. If a parent, brother, sister, or other family member has
a history of eczema and allergies, discuss feeding with your child's doctor.

There is also evidence that being exposed to certain allergens (such as dust
mites and cat dander) in the first year of life may prevent some allergies.
This is called the "hygiene hypothesis." It came from the observation that
infants on farms tend to have fewer allergies than those who grow up in more
sterile environments. However, older children do not seem to benefit.

Once allergies have developed, treating the allergies and carefully avoiding
allergy triggers can prevent reactions in the future.
