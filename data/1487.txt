Adult head lice are roughly 2-3 mm long. Head lice infest the head and neck
and attach their eggs to the base of the hair shaft. Lice move by crawling;
they cannot hop or fly.

Head lice infestation, or pediculosis, is spread most commonly by close
person-to-person contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the
transmission of human lice.

Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available for treatment
of head lice infestations.
