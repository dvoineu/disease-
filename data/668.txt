## Summary

Listeriosis is a foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes, bacteria
found in soil and water. It can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in
processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Listeria is unlike
many other germs because it can grow even in the cold temperature of the
refrigerator.

Symptoms include fever and chills, headache, upset stomach and vomiting.
Treatment is with antibiotics.

Anyone can get the illness. But it is most likely to affect pregnant women and
unborn babies, older adults, and people with weak immune systems. To reduce
your risk

    * Use precooked and ready-to-eat foods as soon as you can 
    * Avoid raw milk and raw milk products
    * Heat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hot
    * Wash fresh fruits and vegetables 
    * Avoid rare meat and refrigerated smoked seafood
