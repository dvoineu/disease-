## Summary

The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Bladder
cancer occurs in the lining of the bladder. It is the sixth most common type
of cancer in the United States.

Symptoms include

  * Blood in your urine
  * A frequent urge to urinate
  * Pain when you urinate
  * Low back pain

Risk factors for developing bladder cancer include smoking and exposure to
certain chemicals in the workplace. People with a family history of bladder
cancer or who are older, white, or male have a higher risk.

Treatments for bladder cancer include surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, and biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own
ability to fight cancer.
