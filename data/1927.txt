## Summary

Potassium is a mineral that your body needs to work properly. It is a type of
electrolyte. It helps your nerves to function and muscles to contract. It
helps your heartbeat stay regular. It also helps move nutrients into cells and
waste products out of cells. A diet rich in potassium helps to offset some of
sodium's harmful effects on blood pressure.

Many people get all the potassium they need from what they eat and drink.
Sources of potassium in the diet include

    * Leafy greens, such as spinach and collards
    * Fruit from vines, such as grapes and blackberries
    * Root vegetables, such as carrots and potatoes
    * Citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruit

Your kidneys help to keep the right amount of potassium in your body. If you
have chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may not remove extra potassium from
the blood. Some medicines also can raise your potassium level. You may need a
special diet to lower the amount of potassium that you eat.
