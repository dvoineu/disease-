## Summary

Pets can add fun, companionship and a feeling of safety to your life. Before
getting a pet, think carefully about which animal is best for your family.
What is each family member looking for in a pet? Who will take care of it?
Does anyone have pet allergies? What type of animal suits your lifestyle and
budget?

Once you own a pet, keep it healthy. Know the signs of medical problems. Take
your pet to the veterinarian if you notice:

    * Loss of appetite
    * Drinking a lot of water
    * Gaining or losing a lot of weight quickly
    * Strange behavior
    * Being sluggish and tired
    * Trouble getting up or down
    * Strange lumps
