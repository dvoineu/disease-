## Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. The body produces many amino
acids and others come from food. The body absorbs amino acids through the
small intestine into the blood. Then the blood carries them throughout the
body.

## Blood Glucose

Glucose -- also called blood sugar -- is the main sugar found in the blood and
the main source of energy for your body.

## Calories

A unit of energy in food. Carbohydrates, fats, protein, and alcohol in the
foods and drinks we eat provide food energy or "calories."

Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients. Your digestive system
changes carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body uses this sugar
for energy for your cells, tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in
your liver and muscles for when it is needed. There are two types of
carbohydrates: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates include natural and
added sugars. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals,
starchy vegetables and legumes.

## Cholesterol

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance thatâs found in all cells of the
body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and
substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it
needs. However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat. High
levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease.

## Dehydration

Dehydration is a condition that happens when you do not take in enough liquids
to replace those that you lose. You can lose liquids through frequent
urinating, sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting. When you are dehydrated, your body
does not have enough fluid and electrolytes to work properly.

## Diet

Your diet is made up of what you eat and drink. There are many different types
of diets, such as vegetarian diets, weight loss diets, and diets for people
with certain health problems.

## Dietary Supplements

A dietary supplement is a product you take to supplement your diet. It
contains one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins; minerals; herbs
or other botanicals; amino acids; and other substances). Supplements do not
have to go through the testing that drugs do for effectiveness and safety.

## Digestion

Digestion is the process the body uses to break down food into nutrients. The
body uses the nutrients for energy, growth, and cell repair.

## Electrolytes

Electrolytes are minerals in body fluids. They include sodium, potassium,
magnesium, and chloride. When you are dehydrated, your body does not have
enough fluid and electrolytes.

## Enzymes

Enzymes are substances that speed up chemical reactions in the body.

## Fatty Acid

Fatty acid is a major component of fats that is used by the body for energy
and tissue development.

## Fiber

Fiber is a substance in plants. Dietary fiber is the kind you eat. It's a type
of carbohydrate. You may also see it listed on a food label as soluble fiber
or insoluble fiber. Both types have important health benefits. Fiber makes you
feel full faster, and stay full for a longer time. That can help you control
your weight. It helps digestion and helps prevent constipation.

## Gluten

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It can also be in
products such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and certain
medicines.

## Glycemic Index

The glycemic index (GI) measures how a carbohydrate-containing food raises
blood sugar.

## HDL

HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is also known as âgoodâ
cholesterol. HDL is one of the two types of lipoproteins that carry
cholesterol throughout your body. It carries the cholesterol from other parts
of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your
body.

and Blood Institute

## LDL

LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is also known as âbadâ
cholesterol. LDL is one of the two types of lipoproteins that carry
cholesterol throughout your body. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of
cholesterol in your arteries.

## Metabolism

Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food
you eat.

## Monounsaturated Fat

Monounsaturated fat is a type of fat is found in avocados, canola oil, nuts,
olives and olive oil, and seeds. Eating food that has more monounsaturated fat
(or "healthy fat") instead of saturated fat (like butter) may help lower
cholesterol and reduce heart disease risk. However, monounsaturated fat has
the same number of calories as other types of fat and may contribute to weight
gain if you eat too much of it.

## Nutrient

Nutrients are chemical compounds in food that are used by the body to function
properly and maintain health. Examples include proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals.

## Nutrition

This field of study focuses on foods and substances in foods that help animals
(and plants) to grow and stay healthy. Nutrition science also includes
behaviors and social factors related to food choices. The foods we eat provide
energy (calories) and nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins,
minerals, and water. Eating healthy foods in the right amounts gives your body
energy to perform daily activities, helps you to maintain a healthy body
weight, and can lower your risk for certain diseases such as diabetes and
heart disease.Â

## Polyunsaturated Fat

Polyunsaturated fat is a type of fat that is liquid at room temperature. There
are two types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): omega-6 and omega-3.
Omega-6 fatty acids are found in liquid vegetable oils, such as corn oil,
safflower oil, and soybean oil. Omega-3 fatty acids come from plant
sourcesâincluding canola oil, flaxseed, soybean oil, and walnutsâand from
fish and shellfish.

## Protein

Protein is in every living cell in the body. Your body needs protein from the
foods you eat to build and maintain bones, muscles, and skin. You get proteins
in your diet from meat, dairy products, nuts, and certain grains and beans.
Proteins from meat and other animal products are complete proteins. This means
they supply all of the amino acids the body can't make on its own. Plant
proteins are incomplete. You must combine different types of plant proteins to
get all of the amino acids your body needs. You need to eat protein every day,
because your body doesn't store it the way it stores fats or carbohydrates.

## Saturated Fat

Saturated fat is a type of fat that is solid at room temperature. Saturated
fat is found in full-fat dairy products (like butter, cheese, cream, regular
ice cream, and whole milk), coconut oil, lard, palm oil, ready-to-eat meats,
and the skin and fat of chicken and turkey, among other foods. Saturated fats
have the same number of calories as other types of fat, and may contribute to
weight gain if eaten in excess. Eating a diet high in saturated fat also
raises blood cholesterol and risk of heart disease.

## Sodium

Table salt is made up of the elements sodium and chlorine - the technical name
for salt is sodium chloride. Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It
helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right
balance of fluids in your body.

## Sugar

Sugars are a type of simple carbohydrate. They have a sweet taste. Sugars can
be found naturally in fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products. They are
also added to many foods and drinks during preparation or processing. Types of
sugar include glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Your digestive system breaks
down sugar into glucose. Your cells use the glucose for energy.

## Total Fat

Fat is a type of nutrient. You need a certain amount of fat in your diet to
stay healthy, but not too much. Fats give you energy and help your body absorb
vitamins. Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels. Not
all fats are the same. You should try to avoid saturated fats and trans fats.

## Trans Fat

Trans fat is a type of fat that is created when liquid oils are changed into
solid fats, like shortening and some margarines. It makes them last longer
without going bad. It may also be found in crackers, cookies, and snack foods.
Trans fat raises your LDL (bad) cholesterol and lowers your HDL (good)
cholesterol.

## Triglycerides

Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Too much of this type of
fat may raise the risk of coronary artery heart disease, especially in women.

## Water Intake

We all need to drink water. How much you need depends on your size, activity
level, and the weather where you live. Keeping track of your water intake
helps make sure that you get enough. Your intake includes fluids that you
drink, and fluids you get from food.
