The Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on
influenza activity year-round in the United States. FluView, a weekly
influenza surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, an online application
which allows for more in-depth exploration of influenza surveillance data, are
updated each week. **The data presented each week are preliminary and may
change as more data is received.**

The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC
and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments,
public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare
providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories
is collected from eight data sources in order to:

and the  **National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)
- **Approximately 100 public health and over 300 clinical laboratories located
throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia
participate in virologic surveillance for influenza through either the U.S.
WHO Collaborating Laboratories System or NREVSS.  Influenza testing practices
differ in public health and clinical laboratories and each source provides
valuable information for monitoring influenza activity.  Clinical laboratories
primarily test respiratory specimens for diagnostic purposes and data from
these laboratories provide useful information on the timing and intensity of
influenza activity.  Public health laboratories primarily test specimens for
surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus types, subtypes, and
lineages are circulating and the age groups being affected.

All public health and clinical laboratories report each week to CDC the total
number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number positive
for influenza viruses, along with age or age group of the person, if
available.  Data presented from clinical laboratories include the weekly total
number of specimens tested, the number of positive influenza tests, and the
percent positive by influenza virus type.  Data presented from public health
laboratories include the weekly total number of specimens tested and the
number positive by influenza virus type and subtype/lineage.  In order to
obtain specimens in an efficient manner, public health laboratories often
receive samples that have already tested positive for an influenza virus at a
clinical laboratory.  As a result, monitoring the percent of specimens testing
positive for an influenza virus in a public health laboratory is less useful
(i.e., we expect a higher percent positive). In order to use each data source
most appropriately and to avoid duplication, reports from public health and
clinical laboratories are presented separately in both FluView and FluView
Interactive.

The age distribution of influenza positive specimens reported from public
health laboratories is visualized in FluView Interactive.  The number and
proportion of influenza virus-positive specimens by influenza A subtype and
influenza B lineage are presented by age group (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-64
years, and ≥65 years) each week and cumulative totals are provided for the
season.

Additional laboratory data for current and past seasons and by geographic
level (national, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region, and
state) are available on FluView Interactive.

**Virus Characterization** - Most U.S. viruses submitted for virus
characterization come from state and local public health laboratories. Due to
Right Size Roadmapexternal icon considerations, specimen submission guidance
to public health laboratories for the 2019-2020 season is that, if available,
2 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 3 influenza A(H3N2), and 2 influenza B viruses be
submitted every other week. Therefore, the numbers of each virus type/subtype
characterized should be more balanced across subtypes/lineages but will not
reflect the actual proportion of circulating viruses. The goal of antigenic
and genetic characterization is to compare how similar the currently
circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing
viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines and to monitor
evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating
in humans. For genetic characterization, all influenza-positive surveillance
samples received at CDC undergo next-generation sequencing to determine the
genetic identity of circulating influenza viruses and to monitor the
evolutionary trajectory of viruses circulating in our population. Virus gene
segments are classified into genetic clades/subclades based on phylogenetic
analysis. However, genetic changes that classify the clades/subclades do not
always result in antigenic changes. "Antigenic drift" is a term used to
describe gradual antigenic change that occurs as viruses evolve to escape host
immune pressure. Antigenic drift is evaluated using hemagglutination
inhibition and/or neutralization based focus reduction assays to compare
antigenic properties of cell-propagated reference viruses representing
currently recommended vaccine components with those of cell-propagated
circulating viruses.

CDC also tests a subset of the influenza viruses collected by public health
laboratories for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals
(oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA cap-dependent endonuclease
inhibitor (baloxavir). Susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors is
assessed using next-generation sequencing analysis and/or a functional assay.
Neuraminidase sequences of viruses are inspected to detect the presence of
amino acid substitutions, previously associated with reduced or highly reduced
inhibition by any of three neuraminidase inhibitorspdf iconexternal icon. In
addition, a subset of viruses is tested using the neuraminidase inhibition
assay with three neuraminidase inhibitors. The level of neuraminidase activity
inhibition is reported using the thresholds recommended by the World Health
Organization Expert Working Group of the Global Influenza Surveillance and
Response System (GISRS)pdf iconexternal icon. These samples are routinely
obtained for surveillance purposes rather than for diagnostic testing of
patients suspected to be infected with an antiviral-resistant virus.
Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed using next-generation sequencing
analysis to identify PA protein changes previously associated with reduced
susceptibility to this medication; a subset of representative viruses is also
tested phenotypically using a high-content imaging neutralization test.

Results of the antigenic and genetic characterization and antiviral
susceptibility testing are presented in the virus characterization and
antiviral resistance sections of the FluView report.

**Surveillance for Novel Influenza A Viruses**  - In 2007, human infection
with a novel influenza A virus became a nationally notifiable condition. Novel
influenza A virus infections include all human infections with influenza A
viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza
H1 and H3 viruses. These viruses include those that are subtyped as nonhuman
in origin and those that cannot be subtyped with standard laboratory methods
and reagents.  Rapid detection and reporting of human infections with novel
influenza A viruses - viruses against which there is often little to no pre-
existing immunity - is important to facilitate prompt awareness and
characterization of influenza A viruses with pandemic potential and accelerate
the implementation of public health responses to limit the transmission and
impact of these viruses.

Newly reported cases of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are
reported in FluView and additional information, including case counts by
geographic location, virus subtype, and calendar year, are available on
FluView Interactive.

 **2\. Outpatient Illness Surveillance**

Information on outpatient visits to health care providers for influenza-like
illness is collected through the  **U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness
Surveillance Network (ILINet)**. ILINet consists of outpatient healthcare
providers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S.
Virgin Islands reporting approximately 60 million patient visits during the
2018-19 season. Each week, approximately 2,600 outpatient healthcare providers
around the country report data to CDC on the total number of patients seen for
any reason and the number of those patients with influenza-like illness (ILI)
by age group (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and ≥65 years).
For this system, ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or
greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than
influenza. Sites with electronic health records use an equivalent definition
as determined by public health authorities.

Additional data on medically attended visits for ILI for current and past
seasons and by geographic level (national, HHS region, and state) are
available on FluView Interactive.

The national percentage of patient visits to healthcare providers for ILI
reported each week is calculated by combining state-specific data weighted by
state population. This percentage is compared each week with the national
baseline of 2.4% for the 2019-2020 influenza season. The baseline is developed
by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-
influenza weeks for the previous three seasons and adding two standard
deviations. A non-influenza week is defined as periods of two or more
consecutive weeks in which each week accounted for less than 2% of the
season's total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza in
public health laboratories.  Due to wide variability in regional level data,
it is not appropriate to apply the national baseline to regional data;
therefore, region-specific baselines are calculated using the same
methodology.

Regional baselines for the 2019-2020 influenza season are:

**Region 1  **-- 1.9%  
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont

**Region 2  **-- 3.2%  
New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands

**Region 3**  -- 1.9%  
Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West
Virginia

**Region 4  **-- 2.4%  
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Tennessee

**Region 5  **-- 1.9%  
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin

**Region 6  **-- 3.8%  
Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas

**Region 7  **-- 1.7%  
Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska

**Region 8  **-- 2.7%  
Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming

**Region 9**  -- 2.4%  
Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada

**Region 10** -- 1.5%  
Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington

**ILI Activity Indicator Map:**  -- Data collected in ILINet are also used to
produce a measure of ILI activity for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District
of Columbia, and New York City. Activity levels are based on the percent of
outpatient visits due to ILI in a jurisdiction compared with the average
percent of ILI visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza
virus circulation (i.e., non-influenza weeks) in that jurisdiction.  The
number of sites reporting each week is variable, therefore baselines are
adjusted each week based on which sites within each jurisdiction provide data.
To perform this adjustment, provider level baseline ratios are calculated for
those that have a sufficient reporting history.  Providers that do not have
the required reporting history are assigned the baseline ratio for their
practice type.  The jurisdiction level baseline is then calculated using a
weighted sum of the baseline ratios for each contributing provider.

The activity levels compare the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI for
the current week to the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI for non-
influenza weeks.  The 10 activity levels correspond to the number of standard
deviations below, at or above the mean for the current week compared with the
mean of the non-influenza weeks.  There are 10 activity levels classified as
minimal (levels 1-3), low (levels 4-5), moderate (levels 6-7), and high
(levels 8-10).  An activity level of 1 corresponds to values that are below
the mean, level 2 corresponds to an ILI percentage less than 1 standard
deviation above the mean, level 3 corresponds to ILI more than 1, but less
than 2 standard deviations above the mean, and so on, with an activity level
of 10 corresponding to ILI 8 or more standard deviations above the mean.

The ILI Activity Indicator map reflects the level of ILI activity, not the
extent of geographic spread of flu, within a jurisdiction. Therefore,
outbreaks occurring in a single city could cause the state to display high
activity levels. In addition, data collected in ILINet may disproportionally
represent certain populations within a state, and therefore, may not
accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state.
Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state
health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with
data presented by the state likely being the more complete.

The ILI Activity Indicator Map displays state-specific activity levels for
multiple seasons and allows a visual representation of relative activity from
state to state.  More information is available on FluView Interactive.

 **3. ** **Summary of the Geographic Spread of Influenza**

State and territorial health departments report the estimated level of
geographic spread of influenza activity in their jurisdictions each week
through the  **State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report**. This level does
not measure the severity of influenza activity; low levels of influenza
activity occurring throughout a jurisdiction would result in a classification
of "widespread".  Jurisdictions classify geographic spread as follows:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **No Activity:**  No laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and no reported increase in the number of cases of ILI.

territorial epidemiologists for the current and past seasons are available on
FluView Interactive.

**4.  ** **Hospitalization Surveillance**

Laboratory confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and
adults are monitored through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance
Network (FluSurv-NET). FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for
laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children younger
than 18 years of age (since the 2003-2004 influenza season) and adults (since
the 2005-2006 influenza season). The network includes more than 70 counties in
the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM,
NY, OR, and TN) and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project
(IHSP) states. The IHSP began during the 2009-2010 season to enhance
surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites included IA, ID, MI, OK
and SD during the 2009-2010 season; ID, MI, OH, OK, RI, and UT during the
2010-2011 season; MI, OH, RI, and UT during the 2011-2012 season; IA, MI, OH,
RI, and UT during the 2012-2013 season; and MI, OH, and UT during the
2013-2014 through 2019-20 seasons.

Cases are identified by reviewing hospital laboratory and admission databases
and infection control logs for patients hospitalized during the influenza
season with a documented positive influenza test (i.e., viral culture,
direct/indirect fluorescent antibody assay (DFA/IFA), rapid influenza
diagnostic test (RIDT), or molecular assays including reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). Data gathered are used to estimate age-
specific hospitalization rates on a weekly basis and describe characteristics
of persons hospitalized with influenza illness. The rates provided are likely
to be an underestimate as influenza-related hospitalizations can be missed if
testing is not performed.

Patient charts are reviewed to determine if any of the following categories of

During the 2017-18 season, seven FluSurv-NET sites (CA, GA, MN, NM, NYA, OH,
OR) conducted random sampling to select cases ≥50 years for medical chart
abstraction, while still performing full chart abstractions of all cases <50
years. During the 2018-19 season, six sites (CA, GA, NM, NYA, OH, OR)
conducted random sampling of cases ≥65 years for medical chart abstraction.
All other sites performed full chart abstractions on all cases. Data on age,
sex, admission date, in-hospital death, and influenza test results were
collected for all cases. For each season going forward, including 2019-20,
sampling for medical chart abstraction may be considered in cases ≥50 years.
In early January of each season, observed case counts across all FluSurv-NET
sites will be compared against predetermined thresholds to determine whether
sampling will be implemented for the season.

Additional FluSurv-NET data including hospitalization rates for multiple
seasons and different age groups and data on patient characteristics (such as
virus, type, demographic, and clinical information) are available on FluView
Interactive.

 **5\. Mortality Surveillance**

**National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance data**
- NCHS collects death certificate data from state vital statistics offices for
all deaths occurring in the United States. Pneumonia and influenza (P&I)
deaths are identified based on ICD-10 multiple cause of death codes.  NCHS
surveillance data are aggregated by the week of death occurrence.  To allow
for collection of enough data to produce a stable P&I percentage, NCHS
surveillance data are released one week after the week of death.  The NCHS
surveillance data are used to calculate the percent of all deaths occurring in
a given week that had pneumonia and/or influenza listed as a cause of death.
The P&I percentage for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase
or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the
states by NCHS.  The P&I percentage is compared to a seasonal baseline of P&I
deaths that is calculated using a periodic regression model incorporating a
robust regression procedure applied to data from the previous five years.  An
increase of 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline of P&I
deaths is considered the "epidemic threshold," i.e., the point at which the
observed proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza was
significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the
absence of substantial influenza-related mortality.

Additional pneumonia and influenza mortality data for current and past seasons
and by geographic level (national, HHS region, and state) are available on
FluView Interactive. Data displayed on the regional and state-level are
aggregated by the state of residence of the decedent.

**Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System**  --
Influenza-associated deaths in children (persons less than 18 years of age)
was added as a nationally notifiable condition in 2004. An influenza-
associated pediatric death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death
resulting from a clinically compatible illness that was confirmed to be
influenza by an appropriate laboratory diagnostic test. There should be no
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.  Demographic and
clinical information are collected on each case and are transmitted to CDC.

Additional information on influenza-associated pediatric deaths including
basic demographics, underlying conditions, bacterial co-infections, and place
of death for the current and past seasons, is available on FluView
Interactive.

#### Influenza Surveillance Considerations

It is important to remember the following about influenza surveillance in the

Each surveillance participant is requested to summarize weekly data and submit it to CDC by Tuesday afternoon of the following week. The data are then downloaded, compiled, and analyzed at CDC. FluView and FluView Interactive are updated weekly each Friday. 

For CDC/Influenza Division influenza surveillance purposes, the reporting
period for each influenza season begins during  _Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report_  (MMWR) week 40 and ends week 39 of the following year. MMWR
weeks pdf icon[65 KB, 2 Pages]refer to the sequential numbering of weeks
(Sunday through Saturday) during a calendar year. This means that the exact
start of the influenza reporting period varies slightly from season to season.
The 2019-2020 influenza season began on September 29, 2019 and will end on
September 26, 2020.

During most seasons, activity begins to increase in October, most often peaks between December and February and can remain elevated into May. The flu season is said to have started after consecutive weeks of elevated flu activity is registered in the various CDC influenza surveillance systems.
