Clean up after ill pets and people.

_Giardia_ is hard to completely eliminate from the environment, but you can
decrease the risk of human infection or of your dog's or cat's reinfection if
it has been ill. The risk of acquiring _Giardia_ infection from your dog or
cat is small, but there are some steps you can take to minimize your exposure.

Clean and disinfect your home in this way:
