## Summary

Your skin is your body's largest organ. It covers and protects your body. Your
skin

    * Holds body fluids in, preventing dehydration
    * Keeps harmful microbes out, preventing infections
    * Helps you feel things like heat, cold, and pain
    * Keeps your body temperature even
    * Makes vitamin D when the sun shines on it

Anything that irritates, clogs, or inflames your skin can cause symptoms such
as redness, swelling, burning, and itching. Allergies, irritants, your genetic
makeup, and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause rashes,
hives, and other skin conditions. Many skin problems, such as acne, also
affect your appearance.
