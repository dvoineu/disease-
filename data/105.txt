## Summary

Assisted living is housing and services for people who need some help with
daily care. They may need help with things like dressing, bathing, taking
their medicines, and cleaning. But they do not need the medical care that a
nursing home provides. Assisted living allows the residents to live more
independently.

Assisted living facilities sometimes have other names, such as adult care
facilities or residential care facilities. They vary in size, with as few as
25 residents up to 120 residents or more. The residents usually live in their
own apartments or rooms and share common areas.

The facilities usually offer a few different levels of care. Residents pay
more for the higher levels of care. The types of services they offer may be
different from state to state. The services may include

  * Up to three meals a day
  * Assistance with personal care, such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, moving around, and using the bathroom
  * Help with medicines
  * Housekeeping
  * Laundry
  * 24-hour supervision, security, and on-site staff
  * Social and recreational activities
  * Transportation

The residents are usually older adults, including those with Alzheimer's or
other types of dementia. But in some cases, residents may be younger and have
mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or certain medical conditions.
