## Summary

Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment
to make cross-sectional pictures of your body.

Doctors use CT scans to look for

    * Fractures (broken bones)
    * Cancers
    * Blood clots
    * Signs of heart disease
    * Internal bleeding

During a CT scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through
the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests
you receive a contrast dye, which makes parts of your body show up better in
the image.
