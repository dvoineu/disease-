## Summary

Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your
windpipe and larynx. The technical name for your throat is the pharynx.

Throat problems are common. You've probably had a sore throat. The cause is
usually a viral infection, but other causes include allergies, infection with
strep bacteria or the leaking of stomach acids back up into the esophagus,
called GERD.

Other problems that affect the throat include

    * Tonsillitis \- inflammation of the tonsils
    * Cancer
    * Croup \- inflammation, usually in small children, which causes a barking cough
    * Laryngitis - swelling of the voice box, which can cause a hoarse voice or loss of voice

Most throat problems are minor and go away on their own. Treatments, when
needed, depend on the problem.
