**Hepatitis B** is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
HBV is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person
infected with virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can
happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-
injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. For some people,
hepatitis B is a short-term illness, but for others, it can become a long-
term, chronic infection. Risk for chronic infection is related to age at
infection: approximately 90% of infected infants become chronically infected,
compared with 2%-6% of adults. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious health
issues, like cirrhosis or liver cancer. The best way to prevent hepatitis B is
by getting vaccinated.
