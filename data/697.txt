## Summary

MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It causes a staph
infection (pronounced "staff infection") that is resistant to several common
antibiotics. There are two types of infection. Hospital-associated MRSA
happens to people in health care settings. Community-associated MRSA happens
to people who have close skin-to-skin contact with others, such as athletes
involved in football and wrestling.

Infection control is key to stopping MRSA in hospitals. To prevent community-
associated MRSA

    * Practice good hygiene
    * Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healed
    * Avoid contact with other people's wounds or bandages
    * Avoid sharing personal items, such as towels, washcloths, razors, or clothes
    * Wash soiled sheets, towels, and clothes in hot water with bleach and dry in a hot dryer

If a wound appears to be infected, see a health care provider. Treatments may
include draining the infection and antibiotics.
