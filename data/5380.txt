Before collecting and handling specimens for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) testing, determine whether the person meets the current
definition for a "person under investigation" (PUI) for MERS-CoV infection
prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). See case
definitions.

## Specimen Type and Priority

To date, we don't fully understand the pathogenic potential and transmission
dynamics of MERS-CoV. To increase the likelihood of detecting infection, CDC
recommends collecting multiple specimens from different sites at different
times after symptom onset, if possible.

Points to consider when determining which specimen types to collect from a
person under investigation for MERS include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The number of days between specimen collection and symptom onset

**_Collection of all three specimen types (not just one or two of the three),
lower respiratory, upper respiratory and serum specimens for testing using the
CDC MERS rRT-PCR assay is recommended._** Lower respiratory specimens are
preferred, but collecting nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens,
and serum, are strongly recommended depending upon the length of time between
symptom onset and specimen collection. Respiratory specimens should be
collected as soon as possible after symptoms begin - ideally within 7 days.
However, if more than a week has passed since symptom onset and the patient is
still symptomatic, respiratory samples should still be collected, especially
lower respiratory specimens since respiratory viruses can still be detected by
rRT-PCR. For example,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. if symptom onset for a PUI with respiratory symptoms was less than 14 days ago, a single serum specimen (see Section II. _Serum_ ), an NP/OP specimen and lower respiratory specimen (see Section I. _Respiratory Specimens_ ) should be collected for CDC MERS rRT-PCR testing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. if symptom onset for a PUI with an ongoing respiratory tract infection, especially lower, was 14 or more days ago, a single serum specimen for serologic testing (see Section II. _Serum_ ) in addition to a lower respiratory specimen and an NP/OP specimen (see Section I. _Respiratory Specimens_ ) are recommended.



## General Guidelines

For short periods (≤ 72 hours), most specimens should be held at 2-8°C rather
than frozen. For delays exceeding 72 hours, freeze specimens at -70°C as soon
as possible after collection (with exceptions noted below). Label each
specimen container with the patient's ID number, specimen type and the date
the sample was collected.

### I. Respiratory Specimens

#### A. Lower respiratory tract

##### Broncheoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid

Collect 2-3 mL into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or
sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C up to 72 hours; if
exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70°C and ship on dry ice.

##### Sputum

Have the patient rinse the mouth with water and then expectorate deep cough
sputum directly into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or
sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C up to 72 hours; if
exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70°C and ship on dry ice.

#### B. Upper respiratory tract

##### Nasopharyngeal swab _AND_ oropharyngeal swab (NP/OP swab)

Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium
alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances
that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately
into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media. NP/OP specimens
can be combined, placing both swabs in the same vial. Refrigerate specimen at
2-8°C up to 72 hours; if exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70°C and ship on dry
ice.

Nasopharyngeal swab - Insert a swab into the nostril parallel to the palate.
Leave the swab in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions. Swab both
nasopharyngeal areas.  
Oropharyngeal swab (e.g., throat swab) - Swab the posterior pharynx, avoiding
the tongue.

##### Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate

Collect 2-3 mL into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or
sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C up to 72 hours; if
exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70°C and ship on dry ice.

### II. Serum

#### Serum (for serologic testing)

**For serum antibody testing:** Because we do not want to delay detection of
MERS infection and since the prevalence of MERS in the US is low, serologic
testing on a single serum sample collected 14 or more days after symptom onset
may be beneficial. This is in contrast to serologic testing for many other
respiratory pathogens which require collection and testing of acute and
convalescent serum specimens. Serologic testing is currently available at CDC
upon request and approval. Please be aware that the MERS-CoV serologic test is
for research/surveillance purposes and not for diagnostic purposes--it is a
tool developed in response to the MERS-CoV outbreak. Contact CDC's Emergency
Operations Center (EOC) (770-488-7100) for consultation and approval if
serologic testing is being considered.

#### Serum (for rRT-PCR testing)

**For rRT-PCR testing (i.e., detection of the virus and not antibodies):** A
single serum specimen collected optimally during the first 10-12 days after
symptom onset is recommended. Note: The kinetics of MERS-CoV are not well
understood. Once additional data become available, these recommendations will
be updated as needed.

**Minimum serum volume needed:** The minimum amount of serum required for
MERS-CoV testing (either serologic **or** rRT-PCR) is 200 µL. If both MERS-CoV
serology **and** rRT-PCR tests are planned, the minimum amount of serum
required is 400 µL (200 µL for each test). Serum separator tubes should be
stored upright for at least 30 minutes, and then centrifuged at 1000-1300
relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 10 minutes before removing the serum and
placing it in a separate sterile tube for shipping (such as a cryovial).
Refrigerate the serum specimen at 2-8°C and ship on ice-pack; freezing and
shipment of serum on dry ice is permissible.

**_Children and adults:_** Collect 1 tube (5-10 mL) of whole blood in a serum
separator tube.

**_Infant:_** A minimum of 1 mL of whole blood is needed for testing pediatric
patients. If possible, collect 1 mL in a serum separator tube.

### III. Shipping

Specimens from suspected MERS cases must be packaged, shipped, and transported
according to the current edition of the International Air Transport
Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulationsexternal icon. Shipments from
outside of the United States may require an importation permit that can be
obtained from CDC.

Specimens should be stored and shipped at the temperatures indicated above. If
samples are unable to be shipped within 72 hours of collection, they should be
stored at -70°C and shipped on dry ice. When shipping frozen specimen from
long distances or from international locations, it is best to use a
combination of dry ice and frozen gel ice-packs. The gel ice-packs will remain
frozen for a day or two after the dry ice has dissipated.

All specimens must be pre-packed to prevent breakage and spillage. Specimen
containers should be sealed with Parafilm® and placed in ziplock bags. Place
enough absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the Secondary
Container (containing Primary Container) and separate the Primary Containers
(containing specimen) to prevent breakage. Send specimens with cold packs or
other refrigerant blocks that are self-contained, not actual wet ice. This
prevents leaking and the appearance of a spill. When large numbers of
specimens are being shipped, they should be organized in a sequential manner
in boxes with separate compartments for each specimen.

Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and
transporting specimens can be found at Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines
for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Summary of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR Testing Guidelines for Specimens

Many state health department laboratories are approved for MERS-CoV testing
using the CDC rRT-PCR assay. Contact your local/state health department to
notify them of the PUI and to request MERS-CoV testing. If your state health
department is unable to test, contact CDC's EOC at 770-488-7100.

Testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory pathogens can be done
simultaneously. Virus isolation in cell culture and initial characterization
of viral agents recovered in cultures of MERS-CoV specimens are NOT
recommended at this time. However, if done, these activities must be performed
in a BSL-3 facility using BSL-3 work practices.

##### **Test for MERS-CoV**

The laboratory must follow the protocol for the CDC rRT-PCR assay. "NEGATIVE"
test results should be reported through the CDC Laboratory Response Network
(LRN) within 24 hours. When a "PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE" or "EQUIVOCAL" test
result is obtained, CDC must be contacted immediately as per the assay
protocol, and the result must also be reported to the LRN within 6 hours.
Confirmation of a "PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE" result by CDC is required, however
this should not delay the local investigation and response, including the
contact investigation.

##### **Test for Other Respiratory Pathogens**

Testing for common respiratory pathogens by molecular or antigen detection
methods (not by viral culture) is strongly recommended. Common respiratory
pathogens include 1) influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus,
human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, human
rhinovirus and other respiratory viruses; 2) _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ ,
_Chlamydia pneumophila,_ and other pathogens that cause severe lower
respiratory infections. Clinical presentation, epidemiologic and surveillance
information, and season should be considered when selecting which pathogens to
test for. A few MERS-CoV cases have had other respiratory pathogens detected,
so identification of a respiratory pathogen prior to MERS-CoV testing should
not preclude testing for MERS-CoV, especially if MERS is strongly suspected.
If your laboratory does not have molecular or antigen testing capability for
respiratory pathogens, contact your state laboratory for assistance.
