VHFs are caused by viruses of four distinct families: Arenaviridae,
Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae. Each of these families share a
number of features:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * They are all RNA viruses, and are all covered, or enveloped, in a fatty (lipid) coating.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host, called the natural reservoir.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after the accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs.

In rare cases, other viral and bacterial infections can cause a hemorrhagic
fever; scrub typhus is a good example.

_Arenaviridae_

![Transmission electron micrograph depicting eight viral particles of a virus

families/images/arenaviridae.jpg)

The _Arenaviridae_ are a family of viruses whose members are generally
associated with rodent-transmitted diseases in humans.

_Bunyaviridae_

![Negatively stained transmission electron micrograph depicting Sin Nombre

The _Bunyaviridae_ are a very large family of single-strand, enveloped RNA
viruses and consists of five genera of viruses.

_Flaviviridae_

The _Flaviviridae_ are a family of single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses.
They are found in arthropods, and can occasionally infect humans.

_Filoviridae_

Filoviruses belong to a virus family called _Filoviridae_ and can cause severe
hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates.
