By addressing certain exposures and behaviors among today's youth, we can
reduce their chances of getting cancer in the future.

CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control sponsored a supplemental
issueexternal icon of the _Journal of Adolescent Health_ about ways to prevent
cancer, with a focus on youth. The authors are experts from many different
professions, showing the importance of working together to protect youth from
cancer.

Youth go through many physical and social changes as they grow into adults.
These changes create unique opportunities for cancer prevention. By addressing
certain exposures and behaviors among today's youth, we can reduce their
chances of getting cancer in the future.
