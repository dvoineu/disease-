## Summary

If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.
Over time, this can damage the covering on your nerves or the blood vessels
that bring oxygen to your nerves. Damaged nerves may stop sending messages, or
may send messages slowly or at the wrong times.

This damage is called diabetic neuropathy. Over half of people with diabetes
get it. Symptoms may include

  * Numbness in your hands, legs, or feet
  * Shooting pains, burning, or tingling
  * Nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea
  * Problems with sexual function
  * Urinary problems
  * Dizziness when you change positions quickly

Your doctor will diagnose diabetic neuropathy with a physical exam and nerve
tests. Controlling your blood sugar can help prevent nerve problems, or keep
them from getting worse. Treatment may include pain relief and other
medicines.
