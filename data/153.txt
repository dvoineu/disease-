#  Oil Spills

## Summary

Oil spills often happen because of accidents, when people make mistakes or
equipment breaks down. Other causes include natural disasters or deliberate
acts. Oil spills have major environmental and economic effects.

Oil spills can also affect human health. These effects can depend on what kind
of oil was spilled and where (on land, in a river, or in the ocean). Other
factors include what kind of exposure and how much exposure there was. People
who clean up the spill are more at risk. Problems could include skin and eye
irritation, neurologic and breathing problems, and stress. Not much is known
about the long-term effects of oil spills.
