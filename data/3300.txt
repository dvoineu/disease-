Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The
average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6Â°F (37Â°C). Some
studies have shown that the "normal" body temperature can have a wide range,
from 97Â°F (36.1Â°C) to 99Â°F (37.2Â°C).

A temperature over 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) most often means you have a fever caused
by an infection or illness.

Body temperature normally changes throughout the day.

## Alternative Names
