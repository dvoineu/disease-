## Summary

You have two kidneys. They are fist-sized organs on either side of your
backbone above your waist. The tubes inside filter and clean your blood,
taking out waste products and making urine. Kidney cancer forms in the lining
of tiny tubes inside your kidneys.

Kidney cancer becomes more likely as you age. Risk factors include smoking,
having certain genetic conditions, and misusing pain medicines for a long
time.

You may have no symptoms at first. They may appear as the cancer grows. See
your health care provider if you notice

  * Blood in your urine
  * A lump in your abdomen
  * Weight loss for no reason
  * Pain in your side that does not go away
  * Loss of appetite

Tests to diagnose kidney cancer include blood, urine, and imaging tests. You
may also have a biopsy.

Treatment depends on your age, your overall health and how advanced the cancer
is. It might include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, biologic, or
targeted therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight
cancer. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific
cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.
