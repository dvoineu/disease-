## Summary

Mercury is an element that is found in air, water and soil. It has several
forms. Metallic mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. If heated,
it is a colorless, odorless gas. It also combines with other elements to form
powders or crystals. Mercury is in many products. Metallic mercury is used in
glass thermometers, silver dental fillings, and button batteries. Mercury
salts may be used in skin creams and ointments. It's also used in many
industries.

Mercury in the air settles into water. It can pass through the food chain and
build up in fish, shellfish, and animals that eat fish. The nervous system is
sensitive to all forms of mercury. Exposure to high levels can damage the
brain and kidneys. Pregnant women can pass the mercury in their bodies to
their babies.

It is important to protect your family from mercury exposure:

    * Carefully handle and dispose of products that contain mercury
    * Limit your consumption of fish with higher levels of mercury
