## Summary

Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. It is the most common type of
childhood cancer. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. White blood cells
help your body fight infection. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal
white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it
hard for blood to do its work.

Leukemia can develop quickly or slowly. Acute leukemia is a fast growing type
while chronic leukemia grows slowly. Children with leukemia usually have one
of the acute types.

Symptoms include

    * Infections
    * Fever
    * Loss of appetite
    * Tiredness
    * Easy bruising or bleeding
    * Swollen lymph nodes
    * Night sweats
    * Shortness of breath
    * Pain in the bones or joints

Risk factors for childhood leukemia include having a brother or sister with
leukemia, having certain genetic disorders and having had radiation or
chemotherapy. Treatment often cures childhood leukemia. Treatment options
include chemotherapy, other drug therapy and radiation. In some cases bone
marrow and blood stem cell transplantation might help.
