## Summary

An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects
the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses
against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or
mild symptoms. They can include

    * Loss of hearing on one side 
    * Ringing in ears
    * Dizziness and balance problems

The tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it
grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.

Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are
similar to those of middle ear problems. Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans
can show if you have it.

If the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly. If
you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.

If the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic
disorder called neurofibromatosis.
