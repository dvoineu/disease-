Measles - Maintaining Disease Elimination and Enhancing Vaccine Confidence

_Presented on Tuesday, February 18, 2020._

 _The February session of Grand Rounds_ ,  **"** **Measles - Maintaining
Disease Elimination and Enhancing Vaccine Confidence**"  _was viewed in 13
foreign countries, 47 states, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin
Islands._

Last year marked the highest number of measles cases in a single year in the
United States since 1992, with a total of 1,282 confirmed cases. More than 73%
of these cases were linked to outbreaks in New York, affecting under-
vaccinated communities. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States
in 2000; however, the sustained transmission of almost 12 months nearly led to
the loss of our elimination status.

This session of Public Health Grand Rounds will focus on measles in the United
States and the response to and lessons learned from the outbreaks in New York
in 2018-2019. Presenters from New York City and New York State will share
details about their outbreaks and response efforts. Presenters from CDC will
discuss the national picture of measles in the United States and the agency's
strategy for strengthening vaccine confidence and increasing coverage of
vaccine-preventable diseases.

Audience Questions

##### **Is there any risk of the measles virus spreading from a freshly
vaccinated child to a parent with an immunodeficiency?**

No. There has been no evidence transmission from measles vaccine virus. You
should talk with your doctor about any questions you have about the MMR
vaccine.

##### **What does it mean to be considered as vaccinated?**

You are vaccinated against measles if you have followed the CDC
recommendations.

                    * CDC recommends a specific schedule for children 12 months and older. 
                      * Children should receive their first dose of MMR between 12-15 months of age, and their second dose between 4 and 6 years of age. The second dose can be given at an earlier age, provided it is 28 days after the first dose. 
                      * Most adults only need one dose, if they have no evidence of immunity. High risk adults such as healthcare personnel and post-high school students need two doses.
                    * **Children and adults traveling internationally may need earlier or additional doses.**
                      * International travelers above 12 months should have two doses separated by at least 28 days. 
                      * Infants between 6-11 months of age can receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine. They should follow the recommended schedule and get another dose at 12-15 months and a final dose at 4-6 years.
