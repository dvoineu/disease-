## Summary

If you are trying to have a baby or are just thinking about it, it is not too
early to prepare for a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby. You should see your
health care provider for preconception care.

Preconception care is care you receive before you get pregnant. Your health
care provider can help you figure out which steps you need to take now, such
as

    * Finding and taking care of any problems that might affect you and your baby later, like diabetes or high blood pressure
    * Increasing the amount of folic acid you get to prevent neural tube defects
    * Getting up to date on vaccines
    * Avoiding smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs
    * Trying to reach a healthy weight

By taking action on health issues before pregnancy, you can prevent many
future problems for yourself and your baby. Once you're pregnant, you'll get
prenatal care until your baby is born.
