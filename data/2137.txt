## Summary

Your colon, also known as the large intestine, is part of your digestive
system. It's a long, hollow tube at the end of your digestive tract where your
body makes and stores stool. Many disorders affect the colon's ability to work
properly. Some of these include

    * Colorectal cancer
    * Colonic polyps \- extra tissue growing in the colon that can become cancerous
    * Ulcerative colitis \- ulcers of the colon and rectum
    * Diverticulitis \- inflammation or infection of pouches in the colon
    * Irritable bowel syndrome \- an uncomfortable condition causing abdominal cramping and other symptoms

Treatment for colonic diseases varies greatly depending on the disease and its
severity. Treatment may involve diet, medicines and in some cases, surgery.
