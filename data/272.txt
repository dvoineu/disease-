## Summary

High blood pressure, also called hypertension, usually has no symptoms. But it
can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack and
kidney failure. If you cannot control your high blood pressure through
lifestyle changes such as losing weight and reducing sodium in your diet, you
may need medicines.

Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure. Some
remove extra fluid and salt from the body. Others slow down the heartbeat or
relax and widen blood vessels. Often, two or more medicines work better than
one.
