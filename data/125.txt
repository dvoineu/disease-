## Summary

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common type of male sexual dysfunction. It is
when a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. ED becomes more common
as you get older. But it's not a natural part of aging.

Some people have trouble speaking with their doctors about sex. But if you
have ED, you should tell your doctor. ED can be a sign of health problems. It
may mean your blood vessels are clogged. It may mean you have nerve damage
from diabetes. If you don't see your doctor, these problems will go untreated.

Your doctor can offer several new treatments for ED. For many men, the answer
is as simple as taking a pill. Getting more exercise, losing weight, or
stopping smoking may also help.
