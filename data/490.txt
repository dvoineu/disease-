## Summary

Your spleen is an organ above your stomach and under your ribs on your left
side. It is about as big as your fist. The spleen is part of your lymphatic
system, which fights infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. It
contains white blood cells that fight germs. Your spleen also helps control
the amount of blood in your body, and destroys old and damaged cells.

Certain diseases might cause your spleen to swell. You can also damage or
rupture your spleen in an injury, especially if it is already swollen. If your
spleen is too damaged, you might need surgery to remove it. You can live
without a spleen. Other organs, such as your liver, will take over some of the
spleen's work. Without a spleen, however, your body will lose some of its
ability to fight infections.
