## Summary

Like other parts of the body, bones can get infected. The infections are
usually bacterial, but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from
nearby skin or muscles, or from another part of the body through the
bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with
diabetes, poor circulation, or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at
risk if you are having hemodialysis.

Symptoms of bone infections include

  * Pain in the infected area
  * Chills and fever
  * Swelling, warmth, and redness

A blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone
infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery.
