## Summary

Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a
fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest
food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile
duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.

Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the
flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones
form when substances in bile harden. Rarely, you can also get cancer in your
gallbladder.

Many gallbladder problems get better with removal of the gallbladder.
Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways of
reaching your small intestine.
