## Summary

Is your child ready to use a potty? Children are usually ready around ages
18-24 months. They often signal that they are ready by letting you know when
their diapers need changing.

You should be prepared to commit to three months of daily encouragement.
Successful trips to the potty should be rewarded. Accidents shouldn't get as
much attention. Training requires patience. If it is not successful, it may
mean your child is not ready.

If there are major changes in your family's life, such as moving or having a
new baby, it may not be a good time to start potty training.
