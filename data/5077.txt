who have it on their skin.

Antibiotics are given to kill staph germs when they cause infections. Some
staph germs are resistant to several antibiotics, meaning these drugs are no
longer able to cure the infections. Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ or MRSA is a type of staph that is resistant to the antibiotics that
are often used to cure staph infections.

Who is at risk?

In healthcare facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes, patients or
residents most likely to get an MRSA infection are those with other health
conditions making them sick. Also, hospital or nursing home patients who have
been treated with antibiotics, have wounds or invasive medical devices such as
catheters, or have certain procedures like surgery or dialysis are more likely
to get an infection.

Being treated in the same room as or close to another patient with MRSA can
also increase a patient's risk of getting MRSA, as the bacteria are easily
spread on unclean hands or medical equipment. In general, the first step in
getting a MRSA infection is carrying the germ (also called becoming colonized
with MRSA). Once a person has MRSA they are at higher risk for getting an
infection.

People who are healthy and who have not been in the hospital or a nursing home
can also get MRSA infections. These community infections usually involve the
skin. This type of MRSA infection is known as community-associated MRSA. There
are steps you can take to prevent MRSA infections in the community where you
live, work, and play.

How is MRSA spread?

People who have MRSA germs on their skin or who are infected with MRSA may be
able to spread the germ to other people. In addition to being passed to
patients directly from unclean hands of healthcare workers or visitors, MRSA
can be spread when patients contact contaminated bed linens, bed rails, and
medical equipment.

Can it be treated?

Yes, there are antibiotics that can kill MRSA germs. Some types of MRSA
infections need surgery to drain infected areas. Your healthcare provider will
determine which treatments are best for you.

It is important to get care for MRSA infections early. If left untreated, MRSA
can quickly spread throughout the body and cause life-threatening problems
including sepsis.

Can visitors get it from me?

The chance of getting MRSA while visiting a patient with MRSA is very low. To
decrease the chance of getting MRSA your family and friends should:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Clean their hands before they enter your room and when they leave.

After the hospital, what do I do?

To prevent another MRSA infection and to prevent spreading MRSA to others:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Talk with your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your antibiotics, or if you develop any side effects, especially diarrhea, since that could be a _difficile_ infection, which needs to be treated immediately.
