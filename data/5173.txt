## Yellow Fever Vaccine & Malaria Prophylaxis Information, by Country

Mark D. Gershman, Emily S. Jentes, Rhett J. Stoney (Yellow Fever) Kathrine R.
Tan, Paul M. Arguin (Malaria)

The following pages present country-specific information on yellow fever (YF)
vaccine require­ments and recommendations (Table 2-06) and malaria
transmission information and prophy­laxis recommendations. Country-specific
maps of malaria transmission areas, country-specific maps depicting yellow
fever vaccine recommen­dations, and a reference map of China are included to
aid in interpreting the information. The information was accurate at the time
of publication; however, this information is subject to change at any time as
a result of changes in disease transmission or, in the case of YF, changing
country entry requirements. Updated information reflecting changes since
publication can be found in the online version of this book
(www.cdc.gov/yellowbook) and on the CDC Travelers' Health website
(www.cdc.gov/travel). General recommendations for other vaccines to consider
during the pretravel consultation can be found on the CDC Travelers' Health
website (www.cdc.gov/travel).

### YELLOWâ¯FEVER

Since publication of the 2018 edition of the CDC Yellow Book, large YF
outbreaks occurred in eastern Brazil in 2017 and 2018, involving states where
YF was not previously considered endemic. Notably, human YF cases occurred
within the greater metropolitan area of Sao Paulo City and not far from the
metropolitan limits of Rio de Janeiro City. In response, the Brazil Ministry
of Health conducted mass vaccination campaigns in the newly affected areas.
Based on a review of the situation by the World Health Organization (WHO)
Scientific and Technical Advisory Group on Geographical Yellow Fever Risk
Mapping, in which CDC par­ticipates, preliminary expanded YF vaccination
recommendations were made for international travelers to the eastern and
southeastern states of Brazil. Given that the Brazil Ministry of Health has
initiated its plan to vaccinate the entire population of Brazil against YF by
mid-2019, these preliminary vaccination recommendations for international
travel will likely be made permanent by the advisoryâ¯group.

Revaccination against yellow fever was previously required by certain
countries at 10-year intervals to comply with International Health Regulations
(IHR). In 2014, the World Health Assembly (of WHO) adopted the recommendation
to amend the IHR by removing the 10-year booster dose requirement, and
stipulated a 2-year transition period for this change. Consequently, as of
July 11, 2016, a completed International Certificate of Vaccination or
Prophylaxis (ICVP) is valid for the lifetime of the vaccinee. Moreover,
countries cannot require proof of revaccination (booster) against yellow fever
as a condition of entry, even if the last vaccination was >10 yearsâ¯prior.

In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
published a new recommendation in 2015 that 1 dose of yellow fever vaccine
provides long-lasting protection and is adequate for most travelers. The
recommendation also identifies specific groups of travelers who should receive
additional doses and others for whom additional doses may be considered. For
details, see Chapter 4, Yellow Fever. For the most up-to-date information
about yellow fever vaccine boosters, consult the CDC Travelers' Health website
or the specific publication posted on the ACIP website
(www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6423.pdf).

Ultimately, the clinician's decision whether or not to vaccinate any traveler
must take into account the traveler's risk of being infected with YF virus,
country entry requirements, and individual risk factors for serious adverse
events after YF vaccination (such as age and immune status). For a thorough
discussion of YF and guidance for vaccination, see Chapter 4, Yellowâ¯Fever.

NOTE: Despite the recent changes to the IHR regarding YF vaccine boosters, it
is uncertain whether all countries with YF vaccination entry requirements will
fully adopt this change. Even if countries modify their official policies to
extend the validity period of the ICVP from 10 years to the lifetime of the
vaccinee, there is no guarantee that all national border officials will be
aware of such policy change or be able to enforce it. CDC obtains information
yearly from WHO about official country entry requirements. WHO likely will not
be asking countries about YF vaccine booster entry requirements in the yearly
questionnaires, because it will be assumed that countries are complying with
the amended IHR. This could leave a gap in the foreseeable future in accurate
published information about entry requirements for YF vaccine boosters for
certain countries. Past experience has demonstrated that information given by
consulates and embassies about vaccination requirements is often not accurate.
Therefore, providers and travelers should not rely solely on such information
when determining current YF vaccination entry requirements for specific
destinations. With the caveats described above, readers should refer to the
online version of this book (www.cdc.gov/yellowbook) and the CDC Travelers'
Health website (www.cdc.gov/travel) for any reported updates to country entry
requirements since publication of this edition.

### Table 2-06. Categories of recommendations for yellow fever (YF)
vaccination

YF VACCINATION CATEGORY | RATIONALE FOR RECOMMENDATION  
---|---  
Recommended | Vaccination recommended for all travelers ≥9 months of age to
areas with endemic or transitional YF risk, as determined by persistent or
periodic YF virus transmission.  
Generally not recommended | Vaccination generally not recommended in areas
where the potential for YF virus exposure is low, as determined by absence of
reports of human YF and past evidence suggestive of only low levels of YF
virus transmission. However, vaccination might be considered for a small
subset of travelers who are at increased risk for exposure to YF virus because
of prolonged travel, heavy exposure to mosquitoes, or inability to avoid
mosquito bites.  
Not recommended | Vaccination not recommended in areas where there is no risk
of YF virus transmission, as determined by absence of past or present evidence
of YF virus circulation in the area or environmental conditions not conducive
to YF virus transmission.  
  
### MALARIA

The following recommendations to protect travelers from malaria were developed
by using the best available data from multiple sources. Countries are not
required to submit malaria surveillance data to CDC. On an ongoing basis, CDC
actively solicits data from multiple sources, including WHO (main and regional
offices); national malaria control programs; international organizations, such
as the International Society of Travel Medicine; CDC overseas staff; US
military; academic, research, and aid organizations; and published records
from the medical literature. The reliability and accuracy of those data are
also assessed. If the information is available, trends in malaria incidence
and other data are considered in the context of malaria control activities
within a given country or other mitigating factors such as natural disasters,
wars, and other events that may affect the ability to control malaria or
accurately count and report it. Factors such as the volume of travel to that
country and the number of acquired cases reported in the US surveillance
system are also examined. Based on all those considerations, recommendations
are developed to try to accurately describe areas of the country where
transmission occurs, substantial occurrences of antimalarial drug resistance,
the proportions of species present, and the recommended prophylaxis options.

These recommendations should be used in conjunction with an individual risk
assessment, taking into account not only the destination country but also the
detailed itinerary including specific cities, types of accommodation, season,
and style of travel, as well as special health conditions such as pregnancy.

### FOOTNOTES

**Yellow Fever**  
1 The official WHO list of countries with risk of YF virus transmission can be
found in Table 4-23. Proof of yellow fever vaccination should be required only
if traveling from a country on the WHO list, unless otherwise specified. The
following countries, containing only areas with low potential for exposure to
YF virus, are not on the WHO list: Eritrea, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe,
Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia.  
2 An elevation of 2,300 m is equivalent to 7,546 ft.

**Malaria**  
3 Refers to _P. falciparum_ malaria unless otherwise noted.  
4 Primaquine and tafenoquine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD
deficiency. Patients must be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting
primaquine or tafenoquine. See Tafenoquine Approved for Malaria Prophylaxis
and Treatment for more information.

**Yellow Fever Maps**  
1 This map is an updated version of the 2010 map crated by the Informal WHO
Working Group on the Geographic Risk of Yellow Fever.  
2 Yellow fever (YF) vaccination is generally not recommended in areas where
there is low potential for YF virus exposure. However, vaccination might be
considered for a small subset of travelers to these areas who are at increased
risk for exposure to YF virus because of prolonged travel, heavy exposure to
mosquitoes, or inability to avoid mosquito bites. Consideration for
vaccination of any traveler must take into account the traveler's risk of
being infected with YF virus, country entry requirements, and individual risk
factors for serious vaccine-associated adverse events (such as age or immune
status).
