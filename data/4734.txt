## State-Specific 2015 BRFSS Arthritis Prevalence Estimates

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the best source for
state-specific arthritis prevalence estimates. BRFSS is a state-based, random-
digit-dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US
population aged 18 years or older. The survey is administered in all 50
states, the District of Columbia, and three territories. Since 1996, selected
states have been collecting information on arthritis through BRFSS.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Starting with the 2003 BRFSS and continuing in odd-numbered years, all states collected information on arthritis. From 1996 through 2001 and from 2002 to present, the survey used different questions to collect data.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * In 2002, the case definition of arthritis also changed. Beginning in 2002, CDC's Arthritis Program has focused on doctor-diagnosed arthritis only.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * In 2011, additional survey changes were made. The 2011 BRFSS data reflect a change in weighting methodology (raking) and the addition of cell phone only respondents. For these reasons, it is not valid to look at trends that cross from 2001 into 2002 or from 2010 into 2011 and later.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Beginning in 2012, the arthritis case definition has been collected annually, while other arthritis information continues to be collected in odd-numbered years.

Thus, 2011 is the new baseline for data trends, and prior years should not be
incorporated in any trend analysis using 2011 data to present. Read more about

Comprehensive Report of State-Specific Prevalence Estimates

This  _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report_ surveillance summary on
arthritis prevalence can help improve the understanding of arthritis
differences and the impact at the state and local level. This release is the
first comprehensive report of state-level estimates for adults with arthritis
using 2015 BRFSS data. The findings highlight large geographic variability in
prevalence, health-related characteristics, and management of arthritis.

#### Arthritis in Women and Men (Age-Adjusted)

Women have a higher age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis than men in every
state. When examined by the same prevalence cutoff points (17.23%-21.54%;
21.55%-23.01%; 23.02%-25.68%; and 25.69%-33.58%), there are only four states
in which both women and men are in the highest prevalence group (Kentucky,
West Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama). For the most part, women were in the
middle and high prevalence groups, while men are in the lowest prevalence
group. In the majority of jurisdictions (31 states), at least 1 in 4 women
reported having arthritis.

####  Work Limitation Attributable to Arthritis Among Adults with Arthritis
(Age-Adjusted)

Arthritis-attributable work limitation is very common among working-age (18 to
64 years) adults with arthritis. In states with the lowest prevalence of
arthritis-attributable work limitations, it is still reported by almost 1 in 3
working-age adults with arthritis (32%). In states with the highest prevalence
of arthritis-attributable work limitation, the prevalence is about half of
working-age adults with arthritis.

####  Activity Limitations Attributable to Arthritis Among Adults with
Arthritis (Age-Adjusted)

The age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity limitations
among adults with arthritis is substantial. In every state, at least 1 in 3
adults with arthritis reports arthritis-attributable activity limitations. In
some states, the prevalence is more than half of adults with arthritis.

####  Severe Joint Pain Attributable to Arthritis Among Adults with Arthritis
(Age-Adjusted)

Pain is a common symptom of arthritis. Arthritis-attributable severe joint
pain is reported by at least 1 in 5 adults with arthritis in every state. In
states with the highest prevalence, it occurs in more than 1 in 3 adults with
arthritis.

#### Prevalence by County

The estimated model-predicted prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis among
United States counties ranged from 11.2% to 42.7% in the 3,142 counties in 50
states and DC.

Percentage of adults with doctor-diagnosed arthritis varies greatly within
most states. In general, the southern United States has the highest
percentages of doctor-diagnosed arthritis, particularly Alabama, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia.  In general, the lowest percentages of doctor-
diagnoses arthritis were in Hawaii, Texas, California, and parts of the
Midwest.

At the county level, counties in Appalachia and along the lower Mississippi
River tended to have higher predicted prevalences of arthritis. The majority
of counties in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, and
West Virginia were in the highest quartile (31.2%-42.7%).
