_Asian American_ is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as "a
person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East,
Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent."1 The six largest sub-groups of
Asian Americans are from China, the Philippines, India, Korea, Vietnam, and
Japan.2

_Native Hawaiian_ or _Other Pacific Islander_ is defined as "a person having
origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other
Pacific Islands."1

There were over 16.6 million Asian Americans in the United States in 2016--
approximately 5.2% of the total U.S. population. Native Hawaiians or Other
Pacific Islanders made up 0.2% of the population in 2016.3

Although Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AA/NH/PI)
are often combined together as one group in survey data due to smaller numbers
of the individual groups surveyed, they are actually three distinct groups.

Cigarette smoking among Asian American/Pacific Islander adults is lower than
other racial ethnic groups.4 However, prevalence among Asian sub-groups varies
and can be higher than that of the general population.5

By sub-groups, prevalence of cigarette smoking among Asian Americans varies
considerably:5

* "Use" is defined as self-reported consumption of cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco in the past month.  
† Data taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2016,
and refer to Asian American adults aged 18 years and older.  
§ Data taken from NSDUH, 2010-2013, and include persons aged 18 years and
older who reported smoking cigarettes during the past month.

### Health Effects

#### The three leading causes of death among AA/NH/PI are cancer, heart
disease, and stroke,7 all of which can be caused by cigarette smoking.

### Patterns of Tobacco Use

#### Cigarette smoking varies by AA/NH/PI sub-groups as a result of a number
of cultural, social, environmental, and individual factors.8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * In general, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders tend to be light, non-daily smokers.9

### Tobacco Industry Marketing and Influence

#### Tobacco companies have been creative in their efforts to reach different
racial/ethnic groups. AA/NH/PI smokers are a key market for tobacco companies
since cigarette smoking prevalence in most Asian countries is considerably
higher than in the U.S.8,12

Culturally appropriate anti-smoking health marketing strategies and mass media
campaigns like CDC's _Tips From Former Smokers_ national tobacco education
campaign, as well as CDC-recommended tobacco prevention and control programs
and policies, can help reduce the burden of disease among the Asian
American/Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian population.

self-help materials, nicotine patches, and online help in four Asian languages

Disparities in Adult Cigarette Smoking--United States, 2002-2005 and 2010-2013

Although cigarette smoking has declined significantly since the release of the
1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, disparities in tobacco
use varies among racial/ethnic populations. Moreover, estimates of U.S. adult
cigarette smoking and tobacco use are usually limited to aggregate racial or
ethnic population categories (non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic
blacks or African Americans (blacks), American Indians and Alaska Natives
(AI/ANs), Asians, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders (NHPI), and
Hispanics/Latinos; these estimates can mask differences in cigarette smoking
prevalence among sub-groups of these populations.
