## Summary

Cancer of the eye is uncommon. It can affect the outer parts of the eye, such
as the eyelid, which are made up of muscles, skin and nerves. If the cancer
starts inside the eyeball it's called intraocular cancer. The most common
intraocular cancers in adults are melanoma and lymphoma. The most common eye
cancer in children is retinoblastoma, which starts in the cells of the retina.
Cancer can also spread to the eye from other parts of the body.

Treatment for eye cancer varies by the type and by how advanced it is. It may
include surgery, radiation therapy, freezing or heat therapy, or laser
therapy.
