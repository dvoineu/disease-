## What is an HPV test?

HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It is the most common sexually
transmitted disease (STD), with millions of Americans currently infected. HPV
can infect both men and women. Most people with HPV don't know they have it
and never get any symptoms or health problems.

There are many different types of HPV. Some types do cause health problems.
HPV infections are usually grouped as low-risk or high-risk HPV.

    * **Low-Risk HPV** can cause warts on the anus and genital area, and sometimes the mouth. Other low-risk HPV infections can cause warts on arms, hands, feet, or chest. HPV warts do not cause serious health problems. They may go away on their own, or a health care provider may remove them in a minor in-office procedure.
    * **High-Risk HPV.** Most high-risk HPV infections do not cause any symptoms and will go away within a year or two. But some high-risk HPV infections can last for years. These long-lasting infections can lead to cancer. HPV is the cause of most cervical cancers. Long-lasting HPV may also cause other cancers, including those of the anus, vagina, penis, mouth, and throat.

An HPV test looks for high-risk HPV in women. Health care providers can
usually diagnose low-risk HPV by visually examining the warts. So no testing
is needed. While men can be infected with HPV, there is no test available for
men. Most men with HPV recover from the infection without any symptoms.

Other names: genital human papillomavirus, high risk HPV, HPV DNA, HPV RNA

## What is it used for?

The test is used to check for the type of HPV that can lead to cervical
cancer. It is often done at the same time as a pap smear, a procedure that
checks for abnormal cells that can also lead to cervical cancer. When an HPV
test and a pap smear are done at the same time, it's called co-testing.

## Why do I need an HPV test?

You may need an HPV test if you:

    * Are a woman aged 30-65. The American Cancer Society recommends women in this age group have an HPV test with a pap smear (co-testing) every five years.
    * If you are a woman of any age that gets an abnormal result on a pap smear

HPV testing in _not_ recommended for women younger than 30 who have had normal
pap smear results. Cervical cancer is rare in this age group, but HPV
infections are common. Most HPV infections in young women clear up without
treatment.

## What happens during an HPV test?

For an HPV test, you will lie on your back on an exam table, with your knees
bent. You will rest your feet in supports called stirrups. Your health care
provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the
vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or
plastic spatula to collect cells from the cervix. If you are also getting a
pap smear, your provider may use the same sample for both tests, or collect a
second sample of cells.

## Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

You should not have the test while you are having your period. You should also
avoid certain activities before testing. Starting two days before your test,
you **should not:**

    * Use tampons
    * Use vaginal medicines or birth control foams
    * Douche
    * Have sex

## Are there any risks to the test?

There are no known risks to an HPV test. You may feel some mild discomfort
during the procedure. Afterward, you may have a little bleeding or other
vaginal discharge.

## What do the results mean?

Your results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also
called abnormal.

**Negative/Normal.** No high-risk HPV was found. Your health care provider may
recommend you come back for another screening in five years, or sooner
depending on your age and medical history.

**Positive/Abnormal.** High-risk HPV was found. It does not mean you have
cancer. It means you may be at higher risk for getting cervical cancer in the
future. Your health care provider may order more tests to monitor and/or
diagnose your condition. These tests may include:

    * **Colposcopy,** a procedure in which your provider uses a special magnifying tool (colposcope) to look at the vagina and cervix
    * **CervicalBiopsy,** a procedure in which your provider takes a sample of tissue from the cervix to look at under a microscope
    * **More frequent co-testing** (HPV and pap smear)

If your results were positive, it's important to get regular or more frequent
tests. It can take decades for abnormal cervical cells to turn into cancer. If
found early, abnormal cells can be treated _before_ they become cancerous.
It's much easier to prevent cervical cancer than to treat it once it develops.

Learn more about laboratory tests, references ranges, and understanding
results.

## Is there anything else I need to know about an HPV test?

There is no treatment for HPV, but most infections clear up on their own. You
can take steps to reduce your risk of getting HPV. Having sex with only one
partner and having safe sex (using a condom) can lower your risk. Vaccination
is even more effective.

The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective way to protect yourself from the HPV
infections that commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine works best when it's
given to someone who has never been exposed to the virus. So it's recommended
to give it to people before they start sexual activity. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics
recommend girls and boys get vaccinated starting at age 11 or 12. Usually, a
total of two or three HPV shots (vaccinations) are given, spaced a few months
apart. The difference in the number of doses depends on the age of your child
or young adult and the recommendations of the health care provider.

If you have questions about the HPV vaccine, talk to your child's health care
provider and/or your own provider.
