#  Hemorrhagic Stroke

Also called: Intracerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

## Summary

A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and
hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a
blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells
begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm, an arteriovenous
malformation (AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open.

Symptoms of stroke are

  * Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)
  * Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech
  * Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
  * Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
  * Sudden severe headache with no known cause

It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic
stroke, the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and
then control it. Surgery may be needed. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help
people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.
