Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. If you have high blood
pressure or heart failure, you may be asked to limit the amount of salt you
eat every day. These tips will help you choose foods that are lower in sodium.

## Salt and Your Diet

Your body needs salt to work properly. Salt contains sodium. Sodium helps your
body control many functions. Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you.
For most people, dietary sodium comes from salt that is in or added to their
food.

If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, you will likely be asked to
limit how much salt you eat every day. Even people with normal blood pressure
will have lower (and healthier) blood pressure if they lower how much salt
they eat.

Dietary sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). Your health care provider may
tell you to eat no more than 2,300 mg a day when you have these conditions.
For some people, 1,500 mg a day is an even better goal.

## Limiting Salt in Your Diet

Eating a variety of foods every day can help you limit salt. Try to eat a
balanced diet.

Buy fresh vegetables and fruits whenever possible. They are naturally low in
salt. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and
keep it looking fresh. For this reason, it is better to buy fresh foods. Also
buy:

    * Fresh meats, chicken or turkey, and fish
    * Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits

Look for these words on labels:

    * Low-sodium
    * sodium-free
    * No salt added
    * Sodium-reduced
    * Unsalted

Check all labels for how much salt foods contain per serving.

Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods
that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients. A product with less
than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.

Stay away from foods that are always high in salt. Some common ones are:

    * Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami
    * Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut
    * Soy and Worcestershire sauces, tomato and other vegetable juices, and most cheeses
    * Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes
    * Most snack foods, such as chips, crackers, and others

When you cook, replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and
lemon are good choices. Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.

Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt. DO NOT eat foods with
monosodium glutamate (MSG).

When you go out to eat, stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled
foods with no added salt, sauce, or cheese. If you think the restaurant might
use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.

Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs. Eat fresh fruit or
sorbet for dessert, when you have dessert. Take the salt shaker off your
table. Replace it with a salt-free seasoning mix.

Ask your provider or pharmacist what antacids and laxatives contain little or
no salt, if you need these medicines. Some have a lot of salt in them.

Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap
water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.

Ask your provider if a salt substitute is safe for you. Many contain a lot of
potassium. This may be harmful if you have certain medical conditions or if
you are taking certain medicines. However, if extra potassium in your diet
would not be harmful to you, a salt substitute is a good way to lower the
amount of sodium in your diet.
