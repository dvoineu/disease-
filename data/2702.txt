A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum.

## Causes

Hydroceles are common in newborn infants.

During a baby's development in the womb, the testicles descend from the
abdomen through a tube into the scrotum. Hydroceles occur when this tube does
not close. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube and gets
trapped in the scrotum. This causes the scrotum to swell.

Most hydroceles go away a few months after birth. Sometimes, a hydrocele may
occur with an inguinal hernia.

Hydroceles may also be caused by:

    * Buildup of the normal fluid around the testicle. This may occur because the body makes too much of the fluid or it does not drain well. (This type of hydrocele is more common in older men.)
    * Swelling or injury of the testicle or epididymis 

## Symptoms

The main symptom is a painless, round-oval shaped swollen scrotum, which feels
like a water balloon. A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides. However, the
right side is more commonly involved.

## Exams and Tests

You will have a physical exam. The health care provider will find that the
scrotum is swollen, but not painful to the touch. Often, the testicle cannot
be felt because of the fluid around it. The size of the fluid-filled sac can
sometimes be increased and decreased by putting pressure on the abdomen or the
scrotum.

If the size of the fluid collection changes, it is more likely to be due to an
inguinal hernia.

Hydroceles can be easily seen by shining a flashlight through the swollen part
of the scrotum. If the scrotum is full of clear fluid, the scrotum will light
up.

You may need an ultrasoundÂ or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.

## Treatment

Hydroceles are not harmful most of the time. They are treated only when they
cause infection or discomfort.

Hydroceles from an inguinal hernia should be fixed with surgery as soon as
possible. Hydroceles that do not go away on their own after a few months may
need surgery. A surgical procedure called a hydrocelectomy (removal of sac
lining) is often done to correct the problem. Needle drainage is an option but
the fluid will come back.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

Simple hydroceles in children often go away without surgery. In adults,
hydroceles usually do not go away on their own. If surgery is needed, it is an
easy procedure with very good outcomes. After surgery, a hydrocele can
sometimes reoccur.

## Possible Complications

Risks from hydrocele surgery may include:

    * Blood clots
    * Infection
    * Injury to the scrotum
    * Loss of the testicle
    * Long-term (chronic) pain
    * Continuous swelling

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you have symptoms of hydrocele. It is important to rule
out other causes of a testicular lump.

Pain in the scrotum or testicles is an emergency. If you have pain and your
scrotum is enlarged, seek medical help right away to prevent the loss of the
testicle.
