**Summary  
**The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely
monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2.

This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides updated guidance on
evaluating and testing persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19. It
supersedes guidance provided in CDC's HAN 427 distributed on February 1, 2020.

The outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout
China and to 46 other countries and territories, including the United States.
As of February 27, 2020, there were 78,497 reported cases in China and 3,797
cases in locations outside China. In addition to sustained transmission in
China, there is evidence of community spread in several additional countries.
CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

To date, there has been limited spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As of
February 26, 2020, there were a total of 61 cases within the United States, 46
of these were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. The other 15
cases were diagnosed in the United States; 12 were persons with a history of
recent travel in China and 2 were persons in close household contact with a
COVID-19 patient (i.e. person-to-person spread). One patient with COVID-19 who
had no travel history or links to other known cases was reported on February
26, 2020, in California. The California Department of Public Health, local
health departments, clinicians, and CDC are working together to investigate
this case and are identifying contacts with whom this individual interacted.

CDC, state and local health departments, other federal agencies, and other
partners have been implementing measures to slow and contain transmission of
COVID-19 in the United States. These measures include assessing, monitoring,
and caring for travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19
transmission and identifying cases and contacts of cases in the United States.

Recognizing persons at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of
identifying cases and preventing further transmission. With expanding spread
of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and PUI
criteria are being updated to reflect this spread. To prepare for possible
additional person-to-person spread of COVID-19 in the United States, CDC
continues to recommend that clinicians and state and local health departments
consider COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the
absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case.

**Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Testing of Patients Under Investigation
(PUI) for COVID-19**  
Local or state health departments, in consultation with clinicians, should
determine whether a patient is a PUI for COVID-19. The CDC clinical criteria
for COVID-19 PUIs have been developed based on available information about
this novel virus, as well as what is known about Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/guidance.html) and Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html#evaluation). These
criteria are subject to change as additional information becomes available.



**Clinical Features** |  | **Epidemiologic Risk**  
---|---|---  
Fever1 **or** signs/symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or
shortness of breath) |

**AND**

| Any person, including healthcare personnel2, who has had close contact3 with
a laboratory-confirmed4  COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset  
Fever1 **and** signs/symptoms of a lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or
shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization |

**AND**

| A history of travel from affected geographic areas5, within 14 days of
symptom onset  
Fever1 with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS
(acute respiratory distress syndrome) requiring hospitalization and without an
alternative explanatory diagnosis (e.g., influenza).6 __ |

** **

**AND**

| No identified source of exposure  
  


These criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. In
consultation with public health departments, patients should be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis to determine the need for testing. Testing may be
considered for deceased persons who would otherwise meet the PUI criteria.

1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.

2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been
exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation.
Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in
healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of
COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel.
Additional information is available in CDC's Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk
Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential
Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-
assesment-hcp.html).

Additional information is available in CDC's updated Interim Healthcare
Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed
COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-
recommendations.html).

Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations
when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer
exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the
person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does
exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to
healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings, as described in CDC's
Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of
Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to
Patients with COVID-19
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-
hcp.html).

4Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for
travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.

5Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community
transmission has been identified.  Relevant affected areas will be defined as
a country with at least a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice. Current
information is available in CDC's COVID-19 Travel Health Notices
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers).

6Category includes single or clusters of patients with severe acute lower
respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress
syndrome) of unknown etiology in which COVID-19 is being considered.

**Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection**  
Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and
control practices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-
control/control-recommendations.html) if a patient is suspected of having
COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their
healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is
classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have
identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case
Report form through the processes identified on CDC's Coronavirus Disease 2019
website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html).
State and local health departments can contact CDC's Emergency Operations
Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and
shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on
weekends or holidays. Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being
performed at state public health laboratories and CDC.Testing for other
respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.

For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and
testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal
swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if
available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be
collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not
recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those
receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate
or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower
respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible
once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See Interim
Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from
Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-
specimens.html) and Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from
suspected cases and PUIs
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/biosafety-faqs.html).
