Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a
family of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans
and animals. They are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic
spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss, and a failure to induce
inflammatory response.

The causative agents of TSEs are believed to be prions. The term "prions"
refers to abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to
induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion
proteins that are found most abundantly in the brain. The functions of these
normal prion proteins are still not completely understood. The abnormal
folding of the prion proteins leads to brain damage and the characteristic
signs and symptoms of the disease. Prion diseases are usually rapidly
progressive and always fatal.
