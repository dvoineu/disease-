### Jet Lag

![airplane and clock](/travel/images/airplaneclock.jpg)

Jet lag can affect your mood, your ability to concentrate, and your physical
and mental performance. If you are expected to begin work immediately after
arrival, jet lag can have potentially negative consequences. Fortunately, you
can take steps to minimize the effects of jet lag.

### Before Travel

                                                                                                                                                                  * Exercise, eat a healthful diet, and get plenty of rest.
                                                                                                                                                                  * A few days before you travel, if you can, begin adjusting your body clock to the time zone at your destination. Go to bed an hour or two later than usual (if you are traveling west) or an hour or two earlier than usual (if you are traveling east) to get used to the time change. Also consider scheduling travel a day or two before any important events, to give your body time to adjust while in-country.
                                                                                                                                                                  * If you know you struggle with jet lag, talk to your doctor about taking medicine to help you sleep at night, if this is a concern.

### During Travel

                                                                                                                                                                  * Avoid large meals, alcohol, and caffeine.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Drink plenty of water.
                                                                                                                                                                  * On long flights, get up and walk around periodically.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Sleep on the plane, if you can. Taking sleep medications during a flight should be considered with caution because your lack of movement during the flight could increase the chance of getting deep vein thrombosis (blood clot). Do not use alcohol as a sleep aid, because it disrupts sleep and can provoke obstructive sleepâ¯apnea.

### After You Arrive

                                                                                                                                                                  * If you can, schedule meetings or activities for a time of day you know you will be more alert.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Eat meals at the appropriate local time.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Try to spend time outdoors and have access to natural daylight, which helps adjust your body to the new time zone.
                                                                                                                                                                  * Drink plenty of water. Avoid alcohol or caffeine until you are acclimated to the new time zone.
                                                                                                                                                                  * If you are sleepy during the day, take short (20-30 minutes) naps may help you to feel better during the day and still sleep through the night.
