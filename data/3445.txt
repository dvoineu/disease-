**Puppies** must be at least 3 months old to be vaccinated for rabies and must
wait 30 days after vaccination before entering the U.S.

**Adult dogs (15 months or older)** rabies vaccination must be current. If it
has expired, your dog will need to get a booster vaccination--but it can still
travel immediately. Bring your dog's records of previous and booster rabies
vaccinations to enter the U.S.

Not all the vaccines and medicines in this chart are appropriate for everyone.
You should talk to a doctor (ideally, at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip)
to find out which vaccines and medicines are right for you.

Remember that not all illnesses can be prevented by a vaccine, so review the
_Stay Healthy and Safe_ section on the destination page and read Your Survival
Guide to Safe and Healthy Travel for information on other steps you can take
to protect your health.
