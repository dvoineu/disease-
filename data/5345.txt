Omega-3 fats - Good for your heart

# Omega-3 fats - Good for your heart

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat. We need these fats to
build brain cells and for other important functions. Omega-3s help keep your
heart healthy and protected against stroke. They also help improve your heart
health if you already have heart disease.

Your body does not make omega-3 fatty acids on its own. You need to get them
from your diet. Certain fish are the best sources of omega-3s. You can also
get them from plant foods.

Omega-3 fatty acids should make up 5% to 10% of your total calories.

## Omega-3s and Your Heart

Omega-3s are good for your heart and blood vessels in several ways.

    * They reduce triglycerides, a type of fat in your blood.
    * They reduce the risk of developing an irregular heart beat (arrhythmias).
    * They slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries.
    * They help to slightly lower your blood pressure.

These healthy fats may also help with cancer, depression, inflammation, and
ADHD. Health experts are still discovering all the possible benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids.

## How Much you can eat

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends eating at least 2 servings a
week of fish rich in omega-3s. A serving is 3.5 ounces (100 grams), which is
slightly bigger than a checkbook. Oily fish rich in omega-3s include:

    * Salmon
    * Mackerel
    * Albacore tuna
    * Trout
    * Sardines 

## Fish and Safety

Some fish can be tainted with mercury and other chemicals. Eating tainted fish
can pose health risks for young children and pregnant women.

If you are concerned about mercury, you can reduce your risk of exposure by
eating a variety of fish.

Pregnant women and children should avoid fish with high levels of mercury.
These include:

    * Swordfish
    * Shark
    * King mackerel
    * Tilefish 

If you are middle-aged or older, the benefits of eating fish outweigh any
risks.

## Other Sources of Omega-3s

Oily fish, such as salmon and tuna, contain 2 kinds of omega-3s. These are EPA
and DHA. Both have direct benefits for your heart.

You can get another kind of omega-3, ALA, in some oils, nuts, and plants. ALA
benefits your heart, but not as directly as EPA and DHA. Still, eating nuts,
seeds, and healthy oils as well as fish can help you get a full range of these
healthy fats.

Plant-based sources of omega-3s include:

    * Ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
    * Walnuts
    * Chia seeds
    * Canola oil and soy oil
    * Soybeans and tofu 

Of all plant-based foods, ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil have the highest
amount of ALA. You can eat ground flaxseed over granola or in smoothies.
Flaxseed oil goes well in salad dressing.

## What About Fish oil Supplements?

Most health experts agree that the best way to reap the benefits of omega-3 is
from food. Whole foods contain many nutrients besides omega-3s. These all work
together to keep your heart healthy.

If you already have heart disease or high triglycerides, you may benefit from
consuming higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. It may be hard to get enough
omega-3s through food. Ask your doctor if taking fish oil supplements might be
a good idea.
