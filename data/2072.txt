#  Gun Safety

## Summary

Many U.S. households have guns, but they can cause harm if not handled
properly. Here are some things you can do to keep yourself and your family
safe:

    * Teach children that they shouldn't touch guns and that if they see a gun, to leave it alone and tell an adult. 
    * If your children play at another home, talk to the parents about gun safety. 
    * Treat every gun as if it were loaded. 
    * Always store guns unloaded. 
    * Lock guns in a rack or safe, and hide the keys or combination. 
    * Store ammunition away from guns and keep it locked. 
    * Don't keep guns in your home if someone in your family has a mental illness, severe depression, or potential for violence.
