# CDC Support to Health Officials: How CDC Can Help Respond to Emerging Local
Health Concerns

During an emerging local public health issue or incident, there are several
forms of assistance you can request from CDC as a health official--outside of
a larger-scale emergency or CDC Emergency Operations Center activation, and
under conditions in which your jurisdiction maintains autonomy and control.1

You do not have to be funded directly by CDC to receive technical assistance
and other support, though some types of support require a formal invitation
from your jurisdiction (e.g., for CDC to assist you on the ground in an
epidemiologic investigation), whereas others are only a conversation away.

The following information can help you communicate, consult, and partner with
CDC leaders and staff. Together we can identify and respond effectively to
emerging public health issues and learn from each other's expertise and
experiences.

Health officials can also request short-term technical assistance from CDC
through the following mechanisms:

****Public Health Law Technical Assistance**: **CDC's Public Health Law
Program (PHLP) performs research and creates tools for understanding law and
making law and policy decisions. PHLP also hosts state and local public health
counsel listservs and quarterly conference calls so that state and local
public health attorneys can discuss and collaborate on public health law
issues. PHLP provides guidance or information about legal matters pertaining
to certain aspects of public health. Technical assistance may include services
such as consulting, editing, and planning, but it does not involve an
attorney-client relationship. Request PHLP technical assistance.

**Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support:** CSTLTS provides
customized support for health officials, collaborating to identify CDC and
partner resources, to help address public health issues in their agencies and
jurisdictions, and to improve population health in their communities. CSTLTS
helps health officials address key public health challenges by connecting them
with world-class subject matter experts, developing customized data and
resource packages, and coordinating peer-to-peer networking opportunities.
