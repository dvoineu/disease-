The Framework for Expanding EMS System Capacity During Medical Surge is a tool
for community planners to help explore the role of EMS in medical surge
planning and to examine the need to supplement existing guidance on
integrating EMS into community preparedness plans. The EMS Framework addresses
the partnerships, resources, and planning needed for expanding EMS system
capacity during an emergency resulting in medical surge.

This tool was developed by CDC during H1N1 to help community planners identify
steps to divert unnecessary calls away from the community 9-1-1 system and
non-critically ill patients away from the healthcare system to reserve both
for actual emergency situations. This implementation tool provides a step-by-
step approach by focusing on alternative call center resources.

providers, as well as managers of EMS agencies, EMS medical directors, local
and state EMS systems, local and state health departments, healthcare
facilities, and others involved in the State EMS officials and regional and
state EMS planners. Three separate standard operating procedures (SOPs)
related to this guidance can be used as templates or guides for the
development of local/state/jurisdiction level SOPs. They include
