## Summary

You have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist. They are near the
middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney there are
about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter your blood. They
remove wastes and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through
tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder, which stores the urine until
you go to the bathroom.

Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable
to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines.
You have a higher risk of kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood
pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease
damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems include

  * Cancer
  * Cysts
  * Stones
  * Infections

Your doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney disease.
If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.
