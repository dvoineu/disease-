## Summary

Adoption brings a child born to other parents into a new family. Birth parents
have a number of reasons for placing children for adoption. Overall, they want
better lives for their children than they think they can give them.

Children who are eligible for adoption come from many different settings. Some
are in foster care, a temporary home setting. Other children live in
orphanages or with birth relatives until they can be adopted.

There are different kinds of adoption. Children may be adopted by a relative
or a new family. Some parents adopt children from the U.S, and some adopt from
abroad.
