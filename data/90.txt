## Summary

Your skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles, age spots and
dryness. Your skin also becomes thinner and loses fat, making it less plump
and smooth. It might take longer to heal, too.

Sunlight is a major cause of skin aging. You can protect yourself by staying
out of the sun when it is strongest, using sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or
higher, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding sunlamps and tanning beds.
Cigarette smoking also contributes to wrinkles. The wrinkling increases with
the amount of cigarettes and number of years a person has smoked.

Many products claim to revitalize aging skin or reduce wrinkles, but the Food
and Drug Administration has approved only a few for sun-damaged or aging skin.
Various treatments soothe dry skin and reduce the appearance of age spots.
