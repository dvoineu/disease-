You may make a specific statement in your request limiting the amount of fees
you are willing to pay. If you do not state a specific fee limit we will
assume that you are willing to pay all fees incurred while processing your
request.

We may notify you and request advance payment if your estimated fees exceeds
$250.00.

You may receive the opportunity to narrow your request in order to reduce the
fees, or you may be asked to confirm your commitment to pay the estimated
amount.

**Fee Waivers**  
You may request a waiverexternal icon for FOIA processing fees. However, fee
waivers are limited to situations in which a requester can show that
disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it
is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester (see Section 5.45external icon for more
information on fee waivers).

What rules govern CDC/ATSDR's FOIA activities?

The CDC/ATSDR FOIA Office follows the rules set forth in the Department of
Health and Human Services' FOIA regulations at  
45 CFR PART 5external icon.

What is PAL?

The Public Access Link (PAL) is a comprehensive electronic tool that provides
requesters with basic information on how to obtain access to records
maintained by CDC. PAL allows a requester to search for records, set up an
account to manage multiple requests (setting up an account isn't required to
use PAL), and find out the status of their submitted request(s). PAL will
enhance FOIA efficiency by utilizing technology while supporting information
sharing, accountability, and transparency. To access, visit Public Access Link
(PAL).

How can I check on the status of my request?

You can check on the status of your FOIA request by visiting the FOIA Request
Status page and PAL.

If you are unable to determine the status of your FOIA request, call the CDC
FOIA Office at 770-488-6399 or the CDC/ATSDR FOIA Public Liaison at
770-488-6277 for assistance.
