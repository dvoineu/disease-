## Summary

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing
age. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and other tissues that grow in and
around the wall of the uterus, or womb. The cause of fibroids is unknown. Risk
factors include being African American or being overweight.

Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may
include

    * Heavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods 
    * Feeling "full" in the lower abdomen 
    * Urinating often 
    * Pain during sex 
    * Lower back pain 
    * Reproductive problems, such as infertility, multiple miscarriages or early labor

Your health care provider may find fibroids during a gynecological exam or by
using imaging tests. Treatment includes drugs that can slow or stop their
growth, or surgery. If you have no symptoms, you may not even need treatment.
Many women with fibroids can get pregnant naturally. For those who cannot,
infertility treatments may help.
