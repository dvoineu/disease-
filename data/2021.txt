## Summary

Rosacea is a long-term disease that affects your skin and sometimes your eyes.
It causes redness and pimples. Rosacea is most common in women and people with
fair skin. It most often affects middle-aged and older adults.

In most cases, rosacea only affects the face. Symptoms can include

    * Frequent redness of the face, or flushing 
    * Small, red lines under the skin
    * Acne
    * A swollen nose
    * Thick skin, usually on the forehead, chin, and cheeks 
    * Red, dry, itchy eyes and sometimes vision problems 

No one knows what causes rosacea. You may be more likely to have it if you
blush a lot or if rosacea runs in your family. Rosacea is not dangerous. There
is no cure, but treatments can help. They include medicines and sometimes
surgery.
