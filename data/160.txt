#  Hurricanes

Also called: Cyclones, Typhoons

## Summary

A hurricane is a severe type of tropical storm. Hurricanes produce high winds,
heavy rains and thunderstorms. Hurricanes can cause tremendous damage. Winds
can exceed 155 miles per hour. Hurricanes and tropical storms can also spawn
tornadoes and lead to flooding. The high winds and heavy rains can destroy
buildings, roads and bridges, and knock down power lines and trees. In coastal
areas, very high tides called storm surges cause extensive damage.

Although there are no guarantees of safety during a hurricane, you can take
actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared
can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it
is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.
