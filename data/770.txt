Chesley Richards, MD, MPH, FACP, is the Deputy Director for Public Health
Science and Surveillance. In this position, he is responsible for
strengthening CDC's scientific foundation by working across the Office of
Science, the Office of Laboratory Science and Safety, the Center for
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, and the National Center
for Health Statistics. A primary focus of his role is to advance an agency-
wide public health data strategy and serve as an advisor to the CDC Director.

Prior to this position, Dr. Richards served as CDC Deputy Director for Public
Health Scientific Services and Director of the Office of Public Health
Scientific Services, where he oversaw a broad range of epidemiology, public

aimed at improving population health. During his tenure, he developed and
implemented CDC's Surveillance Strategy to improve the agency's public health
data surveillance capabilities from 2014-2018.

Dr. Richards works at the intersection of public health, healthcare, and
health IT. He began his public health career as a CDC Epidemic Intelligence
Service Officer in the Hospital Infections Program. Since then, he has held a
range of positions, serving as the Director of the Immunization Services
Division; the Director of the Office of Prevention through Healthcare; and as
the Deputy Director for the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, where he
led the expansion of the National Healthcare Safety Network - the nation's
most widely used healthcare-associated infection tracking system.

Dr. Richards earned his M.D. from the Medical University of South Carolina,
and his MPH in Health Policy and Administration from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is board certified in Internal Medicine (Medical
College of Georgia), Geriatric Medicine (Emory University) and General
