## Summary

Healthy teeth are important to your child's overall health. From the time your
child is born, there are things you can do to promote healthy teeth and

or baby's toothbrush. Avoid putting the baby to bed with a bottle and check
teeth regularly for spots or stains.

For all children, you should

    * Start using a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste when they are two years old. You might start sooner, if a dentist or doctor suggests it.
    * Provide healthy foods and limit sweet snacks and drinks
    * Schedule regular dental check-ups 

Forming good habits at a young age can help your child have healthy teeth for
life.
