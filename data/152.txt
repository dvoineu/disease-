#  Radiation Emergencies

## Summary

Radiation is a type of energy. People are exposed to small amounts of
radiation every day from sources such as sunlight. A radiation emergency would
involve larger amounts of radiation and could be caused by

  * Dirty bombs - a mix of explosives with radioactive powder
  * Fallout from a nuclear bomb
  * Accidental release from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapons plant

A lot of radiation over a short period can cause burns or radiation sickness.
If the exposure is large enough, it can cause premature aging or even death.

Although there are no guarantees of safety during a radiation emergency, you
can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being
prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety and losses. If you do experience a
disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to
cope.
