# Exercise clothing and shoes

When exercising, what you wear can be just as important as what you do. Having
the right footwear and clothing for your sport can give you both comfort and
safety.

Thinking about where and how you exercise can help you choose the best
clothing and shoes for your workouts. You can find many of the items you need
at your local sporting goods, department, or discount stores.

## Exercise Clothing Basics

When choosing exercise clothing, consider both fabric and fit.

 **FABRICS**

You can enjoy longer workouts and avoid overheating or getting too cold by
choosing the right fabrics.

To help you stay comfortable and dry, choose fabrics that pull sweat away from
your skin and dry quickly. Many quick-drying fabrics are synthetic, made of
polyester or polypropylene. Look for terms like moisture-wicking, Dri-fit,
Coolmax, or Supplex. Wool is also a good choice to keep you cool, dry, and
naturally odor-free. Some workout clothing is made with special antimicrobial
solutions to combat odor from sweat.

Socks also come in quick-drying fabrics that absorb sweat. They can help you
stay cool and dry, and avoid blisters. Choose socks made with a polyester
blend or other special fabric.

In general, it is best to avoid cotton. Cotton absorbs sweat and does not dry
quickly. And because it stays wet, it can make you cold in cooler weather. In
warm weather, it is not as good as synthetic fabrics at keeping you cool and
dry if you sweat a lot.

 **FIT**

In general, make sure your clothing does not get in the way of your activity.
You want to be able to move easily. Clothing should not catch on equipment or
slow you down.

You can wear loose-fitting clothing for activities like:

    * Walking
    * Gentle yoga
    * Strength training
    * Basketball 

You may want to wear form-fitting, stretchy clothing for activities like:

    * Running
    * Biking
    * Advanced yoga/Pilates
    * Swimming 

You may be able to wear a combination of loose and form-fitting clothing. For
example, you might wear a moisture-wicking loose t-shirt or tank with form-
fitting workout shorts. You can choose what is comfortable to you. Just make
sure the material you choose helps pull sweat away from your skin.

## Shoes to Match Your Activity

The right shoes can make all the difference between feeling refreshed and
having aching feet after your workout. It is worth the extra money you may
need to spend for a good quality athletic shoe.

Make sure your shoes fit your activity.

    * For running, buy running shoes. They are light, flexible, and supportive for simple forward strides. Make sure they have good arch support and cushioning for impact. For walking, choose stiffer shoes with good support and thick soles.
    * For strength or CrossFit training, choose training sneakers with good support and rubber soles that are not too bulky.
    * If you are playing a sport like basketball or soccer, get shoes that match your activity. 

Every foot is different. You may have wide or narrow feet, low arches, trouble
areas, or flat feet. Even in adults, foot size can change, so get fitted every
year. Also, you will need to replace shoes when they start to feel
uncomfortable or the soles look worn.

Your shoe salesperson can help size and fit you for the right athletic shoes.
Many stores will allow you to return shoes if you find they do not work for
you.

## When Exercising Outside

If it is cold, dress in layers. Wear a fitted layer that wicks sweat away. Add
a warmer layer, like a fleece jacket, on top. Wear gloves, a hat, and ear
coverings if you need them. Take off the layers as you warm up. If you will be
out running or walking, you may want to add a backpack. Then you can take off
layers as you heat up, as well as carry a water bottle.

In the rain or wind, wear an outer layer that protects you, like a windbreaker
or nylon shell. Look for the words "waterproof" or "water-resistant" on the
label. Ideally, this layer should also be breathable.

In the hot sun, wear light-colored clothing that dries fast. You can also buy
clothing made to block out the harmful rays of the sun. These clothes come
with a sun protection factor (SPF) label.

When exercising in the evening or early morning, make sure your clothing has
reflective parts so drivers can see you. You can also wear a reflective belt
or vest.

Protect yourself from Lyme disease if you exercise in wooded areas. Wear long
sleeves and pants and tuck your pants into your socks. You can also use an
insect repellant containing DEET or permethrin.
