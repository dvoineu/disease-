## Summary

Cryptosporidiosis (crypto) is an illness caused by a parasite. The parasite
lives in soil, food, and water. It may also be on surfaces that have been
contaminated with feces (poop). You can become infected by swallowing the
parasite, if it is in your food, drinking water, or water that you swim in.
You can also get it by touching your mouth with contaminated hands.

The most common symptom of crypto is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include

    * Dehydration 
    * Weight loss 
    * Stomach cramps or pain 
    * Fever 
    * Nausea 
    * Vomiting 

Contact your health care provider if you have watery diarrhea that lasts more
than a few days. Most people with crypto get better without treatment within
one to two weeks. But crypto can cause serious problems in people with weak
immune systems, like those with HIV/AIDS.

To reduce your risk of crypto, wash your hands often, only drink water that
you know is safe, and wash or peel fresh fruits and vegetables before eating.
