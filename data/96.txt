## Summary

Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens the bones. Your bones become
fragile and fracture (break) easily, especially the bones in the hip, spine,
and wrist. In the United States, millions of people either already have
osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.

Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is more common in older women. Risk
factors include

  * Getting older 
  * Being small and thin 
  * Having a family history of osteoporosis
  * Taking certain medicines
  * Being a white or Asian woman
  * Having low bone density

Osteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you
break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone
health.

To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, exercise, and
do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help. It is also important to try
to avoid falling down. Falls are the number one cause of fractures in older
adults.
