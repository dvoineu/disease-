## Summary

You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact, you may have
charts at several doctors' offices. If you've been in the hospital, you have a
chart there, too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper
or electronic. To keep track of all this information, it's a good idea to keep
your own personal health record.

What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could
start with

  * Your name, birth date, blood type, and emergency contact information
  * Date of last physical
  * Dates and results of tests and screenings
  * Major illnesses and surgeries, with dates
  * A list of your medicines and supplements, the dosages, and how long you've taken them
  * Any allergies
  * Any chronic diseases
  * Any history of illnesses in your family
