## Summary

Cancer is common. Half of all men and a third of women will get a diagnosis of
cancer in their lifetime. Many people with cancer do survive. Millions of
Americans alive today have a history of cancer.

For most people with cancer, living with the disease is the biggest challenge
they have ever faced. It can change your routines, roles and relationships. It
can cause money and work problems. The treatment can change the way you feel
and look. Learning more about ways you can help yourself may ease some of your
concerns. Support from others is important.

All cancer survivors should have follow-up care. Knowing what to expect after
cancer treatment can help you and your family make plans, lifestyle changes,
and important decisions.
