# Cuts and puncture wounds

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.

A cut is a break or opening in the skin. It is also called a laceration. A cut
may be deep, smooth, or jagged. It may be near the surface of the skin, or
deeper. A deep cut can affect tendons, muscles, ligaments, nerves, blood
vessels, or bone.

A puncture is a wound made by a pointed object such as a nail, knife, or sharp
tooth.

## Symptoms

Symptoms include:

      * Bleeding 
      * Problems with function or feeling below the wound site
      * Pain

Infection may occur with some cuts and puncture wounds. The following are more
likely to become infected:

      * Bites
      * Punctures
      * Crushing injuries
      * Dirty wounds
      * Wounds on the feet
      * Wounds that are not promptly treated

## First Aid

If the wound is bleeding severely, call your local emergency number, such asÂ
911.

Minor cuts and puncture wounds can be treated at home. Take the following
steps.

FOR MINOR CUTS

      * Wash your hands with soap or antibacterial cleanser to prevent infection.
      * Then, wash the cut thoroughly with mild soap and water.
      * Use direct pressure to stop the bleeding.
      * Apply antibacterial ointment and a clean bandage that will not stick to the wound.

FOR MINOR PUNCTURES

      * Wash your hands with soap or antibacterial cleanser to prevent infection.
      * Rinse the puncture for 5 minutes under running water.Â Then wash with soap.
      * Look (but do not poke around) for objects inside the wound. If found, don't remove it. Go to your emergency or urgent care center.
      * If you can't see anything inside the wound, but a piece of the object that caused the injury is missing, also seek medical attention.
      * Apply antibacterial ointment and a clean bandage that will not stick to the wound.

Scarring is a complication of any wound. Prompt first aid and the prevention
of infection reduce theÂ amount of scarring.

## DO NOT

      * DO NOT assume that a minor wound is clean because you can't see dirt or debris inside. Always wash it.
      * DO NOT breathe on an open wound.
      * DO NOT try to clean a major wound, especially after the bleeding is under control.
      * DO NOT remove a long or deeply stuck object. Seek medical attention.
      * DO NOT push or pick debris from a wound. Seek medical attention.
      * DO NOT push body parts back in. Cover them with clean material until medical help arrives.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or your local emergency numberÂ if:

      * The bleeding is severe or cannot be stopped (for example, after 10 minutes of pressure).
      * TheÂ person cannot feel the injured area, or it doesn't work right.
      * The person is seriously injured.

Call your health care providerÂ right awayÂ if:

      * The wound is large or deep, even if the bleeding is not severe.
      * The wound is more than a quarter inch (.64 centimeter) deep, on the face, or reaching the bone. Stitches may be needed. 
      * The person has been bitten by a human or animal.
      * A cut or puncture is caused by a fishhook or rusty object.
      * You step on a nail or other similar object.
      * An object or debris is stuck. Do not remove it yourself.
      * The wound shows signs of infection such as warmth and redness in the area, a painful or throbbing sensation, fever, swelling, or pus-like drainage.
      * You have not had a tetanus shot within the last 10 years.

## Prevention

Keep knives, scissors, sharp objects, firearms, and fragile items out of the
reach of children. When children are old enough, teach them to how to use
knives, scissors,Â and other tools safely.

Make sure you and your child are up to date on vaccinations. A tetanus vaccine
is generally recommended every 10 years.
