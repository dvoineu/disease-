False-positive _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC) results can be
difficult to identify, investigate, and resolve. False-positive results often
have serious implications for patient isolation, patient therapy, contact
investigations, and unnecessary laboratory testing. This project, the False-
Positive Investigation Toolkit, was developed to provide mycobacteriology
staff with updated resources to recognize potential false-positive results and
to assist staff in false-positive investigations. In addition, TB Control
programs and healthcare providers may also find this information beneficial
when investigating potential false-positive laboratory results.

The toolkit includes job-aids, posters, and templates that can be modified for
local use.

An accompanying online interactive case study training module,
Mycobacteriology False-Positive Case Studies, can be found on the Association
of Public Health Laboratoriesexternal icon website. The training module walks
through different scenarios of a potential false-positive investigation.

Introduction

False-positive _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC) results can be
difficult to identify, investigate, and resolve. False-positive results often
have serious implications for patient isolation, patient therapy, contact
investigations, and unnecessary laboratory testing. Errors leading to false-
positive results can be classified as pre-analytic, analytic, or post-
analytic. In any mycobacteriology laboratory, cross-contamination, mislabeling
errors, specimen mix-ups, and use of nonsterile reagents can cause the
inadvertent transfer of bacilli from one specimen or culture to another
specimen or culture.

In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors [now
known as Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)] developed a video
and 28-page booklet titled "Recognition and Prevention of False-Positive Test
Results in Mycobacteriology --A Laboratory Training Program." The program was
designed to help laboratorians recognize and prevent false-positive test
results in mycobacteriology. Since 1997, the program has not been updated and
similar publications have been limited in recent years.

This project, the False-Positive Investigation Toolkit, was developed to
provide mycobacteriology staff with updated resources to recognize potential
false-positive results and to assist staff in false- positive investigations.

The toolkit's primary audience is mycobacteriology laboratory supervisors,
technologists, and quality- assurance staff members. In addition, TB Control
programs and healthcare providers may also find this information beneficial
when investigating potential false-positive laboratory results.

Objectives for this false-positive investigation toolkit include:

Pre-Analytic, Analytic, and Post-Analytic Prevention Practices

In any mycobacteriology laboratory, false-positive results can occur from the
inadvertent transfer of bacilli from one specimen or culture to another
specimen or culture through cross-contamination, mislabeling errors, specimen
mix-ups, or the use of nonsterile reagents. False-positive _Mycobacterium_
_tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC) results can be caused by pre-analytic, analytic
(laboratory practices), and post-analytic errors. Information from each of
these three areas will be described on the following pages for readers to
refer to and utilize during potential false-positive investigations.

###### **A. Pre-Analytic Prevention Practices**

![specimen](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/specimen-
small.png)

Specimens submitted to a laboratory should be properly collected, labeled,
stored, and transported. Each of these processes can affect specimen quality,
accuracy of test results, and can result in false- positive results. It may be
helpful for laboratories to create specimen collection and submission
guidelines for submitters that includes information regarding acceptable
specimen types, minimum volumes, collection techniques, labeling, storage,
transport, and laboratory rejection criteria (2).

It is important to properly collect adequate specimens of acceptable quality
for laboratory testing. Contamination can be introduced at the time of
collection. For optimal sputum specimens, patients should be instructed on
proper specimen collection techniques to ensure a quality specimen is
collected. The material should be mucoid and not saliva or spit. Specimens
should not be overtly bloody. The minimum volume of sputum collected should be
3mL (1). The specimen should be collected completely inside a sterile
container and material should not be on the outside of the container. For
guidance on other specimen types, please refer to Table 3 in CLSI M48, 2nd
Edition (1).

Each specimen container, labeled prior to time of collection, should have the
correct patient name and a unique identifying number (two patient identifiers)
clearly written or printed on the specimen container. It is best practice for
the submitter to match the patient specimen to the specimen test order
requisition form. Patient name and identifiers on the collection container
should match what is written or printed on the test order requisition form.

Specimen containers should be properly closed using the container threads and
sealed using laboratory film or another suitable material before transport or
shipping. Packaging and shipping for diagnostic mycobacteriology specimens
should be in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) and the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) packaging requirements for UN
3373 Biological Substance, Category B.

Proper storage and prompt transport of diagnostic specimens (e.g., sputum,
other specimen types) from the collection site or submitter to the testing
laboratory is extremely important for quality test results and efficient
result reporting. Collection sites should refrigerate diagnostic specimens
that cannot be transported immediately in order to reduce overgrowth of
contaminating organisms. Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory as
soon as possible (within 24 hours of collection being optimal) and specimens
should not be batched for shipment if at all possible (3). Specimens collected
at the end of the day or on a Friday, when transport may not be available,
should be stored in the site's refrigerator and then transported with a cold
pack and delivered to the laboratory the following morning or after the
weekend (4).

###### **B. Labratory Prevention Practices - Analytic**

![prevention
kit](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/prevention-
small.png)

Laboratories that perform mycobacteriology testing should ensure that
appropriate practices and procedures are in place to avoid cross-
contamination. Best practices are those methods, techniques, or processes that
have been generally accepted through experience and research to be reliable
and lead  to an accurate result. These processes may reduce the likelihood of
false-positive test results, or could simplify investigating, identifying, or
resolving potential false- positive situations.

**i. Specimen** **Processing**

When processing specimens from patients that are documented as known acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) positive, there is an increased opportunity for the carryover of
organisms from positive to negative specimens. Production of aerosolized
particles during processing of smear-positive specimens, use  of MTBC as a
positive control, or contamination of reagents are major causes of cross-
contamination (5). The use of best practices should reduce the opportunity for
transfer from positive to negative specimens. Laboratory policies and
procedures should be designed to minimize the risk of potential cross-
contamination:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Use** **of separate biological safety cabinets (BSC) if possible:  
**When feasible, do not use the same BSC for processing initial diagnostic
specimens and  known positive patient specimens or isolates to prevent cross-
contamination (6, 7). If only one BSC is available, ensure that diagnostic

**Never use a common flask or beaker to dispense reagents (5, 8, 9, 10). Use

**Processing large numbers of specimens at one time increases the odds that
aerosolization from a positive specimen with MTBC will contaminate adjacent
specimens (2, 11). Process specimens in a batch size small enough to maintain
the timing of the digestion- decontamination step. Additionally, only process
the number of specimens than can be placed in a centrifuge at one time.

**AFB smear-positive specimens are more likely than smear-negative specimens
to be a source of cross-contamination during batch processing (12). Separately
processing specimens from patients previously known to be smear- or culture-
positive can significantly reduce the rate     of false-positive results in a
laboratory (13). If processing separate batches is not feasible, the
laboratory should consider placing these specimens at the end of the
processing  batch.

**The negative control may be 5 to 10 mL of sterile water, broth, or buffer
placed at the end of the processing batch and should be processed in the same
manner as patient specimens. A note of caution: a negative control can be
negative yet cross-contamination within a batch  may have still occurred. The
negative control would likely pick up a large contamination issue but not
necessarily an isolated issue.

**Batch processing highly smear- and culture-positive strains used for
proficiency surveys with clinical specimens can result in cross-contamination
(12). Process PT and QC strains in separate batches and preferably not in the

**_M. tuberculosis_ is a hardy organism that can survive in the laboratory and
contaminate patient clinical specimens. Cross-contamination of patient
specimens in a laboratory that used the avirulent control strain H37Ra in the
same BSC on a different day than specimen processing has been documented (14,
15). Laboratories should be sure to follow decontamination practices after use
of positive controls.

![False-Positive
Smear](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/smear-small.jpg)

A patient sputum specimen with a positive AFB smear result with a subsequent
culture that is negative for growth with no   clinical evidence of pulmonary
TB or the patient is known to be on therapy should be considered suspicious
for a potential false-positive smear result (17). Some patients can shed dead
AFB long after cultures are negative (18). AFB microscopy is not specific and
will detect nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and acid-fast environmental
contaminants. It is essential not to introduce environmental contaminants when
preparing reagents and during wash steps of the procedure. Patient AFB smears

**iii. Molecular** **Testing**

For molecular testing that uses targeted amplification, it is important to
prevent contamination of patient specimens with amplified nucleic acid (DNA)
from other patient specimens (20). Assays that do not use targeted
amplification still have the potential for cross-contamination between patient
specimens. Laboratorians can reduce the risk of molecular contamination
through:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Use of separate workspaces for molecular testing allowing for separation of the** **different testing procedures and minimizing the risk of backflow contamination** **of amplicons.  
**Ideally, these workspaces would be separate rooms, but at the very least
should be defined areas. The distinct molecular areas should be: the "reagent
preparation room/area," the "sample preparation room/area," and the
"amplification detection room/area (20)."

**This practice ensures that work moves from clean (pre-amplification) to
dirty (post- amplification) areas and decreases the potential for carryover or
backflow contamination of amplicons. Laboratorians should limit their
movements to unidirectional workflow: moving through the clean rooms ("reagent
preparation room/area" and "sample preparation room/ area") to the dirty room
("amplification detection room/area") without going directly back to a
previous room. Movement backwards between the rooms could result in
introduction of DNA/ RNA or amplicons into a clean room, thus causing
contamination and potentially false-positive results.

**Dedicated equipment and PPE will reduce contamination from exposure to
patient specimens or amplicons. Specifically, pipettes, racks, ice buckets,
and cooling blocks should be dedicated to specific tasks within each room and
should use filtered tips to prevent  aerosolization and contamination of
pipettor barrels. PPE should be disposable when possible and gloves should be
changed frequently. Many laboratories utilize a color-coding system to ensure
that equipment and PPE are maintained in the appropriate rooms. Additionally,
laboratorians should utilize best practices to prevent aerosolization and to
minimize   cross-contamination.If patient specimens, quality controls, or
calibrators from the "sample preparation room/ area" are introduced to the
"reagent preparation room/area" or if amplicons from the "amplification
detection room/area" are introduced to either clean room, testing results can
be compromised leading to contamination and questionable results. Thus, it is
important to monitor clean rooms for potential contamination through the use
of wipe tests (performed at least monthly and when troubleshooting) collected
from various laboratory surfaces in the clean rooms. If a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) target is found, the area is considered contaminated and must
be decontaminated immediately. An investigation must be performed to try to
determine the source or practice that led to the contamination in order to
prevent it from recurring in the future.

Specifically, no-template controls (also known** **as blank controls) are** **necessary.  
**No-template controls should consist of water, buffer, or specimen transport
medium that is assayed with the testing reagents, but without patient
specimens or nucleic acid. These negative controls are used to detect
contamination of reagents or background signal. Controls ensure that the assay
performed as expected and that patient results are accurate, reliable, and
reportable.

The accurate verification and reporting of laboratory results are essential.
Post-analytic practices include all steps taken to verify and review results,
to communicate results, and to provide easily interpretable results to
submitting laboratories or healthcare providers. Laboratorians can reduce
common post-analytic errors  by:

Laboratory Monitoring

Laboratories should remain observant for potential false-positive results.
This can be accomplished through routine monitoring of test results and by
developing tools and practices that can assist in identifying false-positive
results. Early detection includes benefits for patient management and public
health.

** ** **A** **.** **Situations or Scenarios that** **M** **ight** **Initiate
an Investigation**

A number of events should initiate an investigation into whether a result is a
false-positive. Any one of the scenarios below should also be a reasonable
trigger for a false-positive investigation. Keep in mind that this is not a
comprehensive list, and there may be other situations when it might be
beneficial to conduct a false-positive investigation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Single positive culture (liquid or solid) of multiple specimens from a new patient  
**Patients positive for MTBC should have consistent results in the diagnostic
series.  Results that are discordant within the set of diagnostic cultures
could be indicative of a false-positive result (22, 23). Having only one
positive liquid or solid media MTBC result out of multiple liquid or solid
cultures for the same patient could be an indication of a false-positive
result. Also, single positive specimens have been a sensitive predictor of
cross-contamination in past investigations (8, 12, 24).

will be detected within an average incubation time of 28 days (25, 26). A
culture that has delayed growth on either liquid or solid media and low colony
counts on solid media may be a cause for concern (27, 28). Time to positivity
can be delayed if bacterial load in the specimen is low. A cluster of positive
cultures that appear late with scanty growth (<10 colonies on solid media) or
a delay in recovering mycobacteria in a liquid system may indicate that
contamination occurred during processing (27).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Negative control is AFB smear or culture positive  
**Having a negative AFB smear control slide test positive indicates
contamination of the control, reagents, or the slide. Further investigation is
needed before reading patient AFB smears. Similarly, AFB growth on culture
media for the negative control indicates that contamination occurred in the
processing batch or that the media itself was contaminated. All culture
results from that processing batch should be reviewed since the results are
invalidated by the positive result in the negative control. If results have
been reported, corrected reports should be issued and providers should be
notified.

**

![sample in petri
dish](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/disc-small.png)

Routine laboratory monitoring of the incidence of each species identified
(MTBC and NTM) could detect an increase in a rare species not commonly seen in
the laboratory, which could be suggestive of an increase in laboratory
contamination. Similarly, a sudden increase in the percentage of a species
typically found to be environmental contaminants (e.g., _M. gordonae_ ) could
be a sign of contaminated water or reagents (29).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Unusual increase in isolates with identical drug resistance patterns  
**If a laboratory experiences an unusual increase in MTBC isolates with
identical drug resistance patterns, this may suggest possible false-positive
results. The laboratory should determine whether cross-contamination may have
occurred during specimen processing or culture manipulation set up for isolate
identification or drug susceptibility testing (30, 31). Laboratories should
collaborate with the program's surveillance or epidemiology team to assess
whether there is a suspected cluster with epidemiologic links, or if the same
patient was tested but with different identifying information (e.g.,
mislabeled). Genotyping results should also be reviewed for each of the
isolates.

**

![computer
notes](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/notes.png)

Unusual genotyping results, such as results from patient specimens that are
identical to laboratory PT or QC strains, indicate false-positive results.
Particular strains of MTBC have been chosen for PT and QC strains for
differentiation from strains that circulate in the general population. When
these strains are found during genotyping, it is more likely that these
results are an indication of a false-positive MTBC result. The exception is
whether the isolate could be from a possible laboratory exposure.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Increase in percentage of culture positivity  
**An increase in the percentage of positive MTBC culture results in a
laboratory could be a sign of false-positive results, especially if there is
no other feasible explanation (e.g., an outbreak). Any increase in culture
positivity should be investigated. Routine monitoring of laboratory
indicators, such as total number and percent of positive cultures belonging to
MTBC, will allow for proactive assessment. Additionally, monitoring these data
and maintaining communication with the TB Program could assist in explaining
test results. Genotyping results should also be reviewed when an increase in
positive culture results are investigated.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) positive specimens that are AFB smear and culture negative  
**A single positive NAAT result would be considered suspicious if AFB smear
and culture were negative (37). Results need to be correlated with other
diagnostic findings and patient history. Single positive NAAT results could be
due to contamination or the detection of non-viable organisms in patients on
treatment.

###### **B.** **Monitoring Tools**

Below are examples of monitoring strategies/activities that can aid the
laboratory in identifying or preventing false-positive test results. Best
practice monitoring activities may include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Review of patient 's past ****results** **and current** **test** **orders** **at time of testing  
**Reviewing a patient's previous test results when setting up current testing
will help identify whether the patient has been previously positive for MTBC.
By identifying this early on, the current specimen can be placed appropriately
within the processing batch to minimize potential cross-contamination.

**Reviewing a patient's previous test results when reporting out a positive
result report will help to determine whether the patient is a new positive or
is consistent with previous results for that patient.

**When a specimen is identified as positive for MTBC, it is good practice to
determine if other positive patient specimens were in the same batch (e.g.,
processing, identification or drug susceptibility testing).  This helps to
rule out or to identify the possibility of cross-contamination from other
known MTBC positive specimens processed in the same batch. Studies show that
multiple positive patient cultures from the same processing batch may be
associated with an increased likelihood of false-positive results (22).
However, it is important to determine a laboratory's normal positivity rate as
a baseline for comparison.

**Many laboratories perform monthly or quarterly review of all MTBC results to
monitor for inconsistent or remarkable results. Unusual patient or laboratory
findings could include but are not limited to: same collection facilities,
clusters of positive growth for multiple patient specimens processed on the
same day, no clinical symptoms associated with positive culture results, or
genotypes matching laboratory controls.

**Maintaining accurate and complete records including specimen processing
logs, lot numbers, or quantity of specimen received can assist in identifying
potential causes of an unusual or nonconforming event that leads to a
potential false-positive. Logs or notes could provide critical details, which
are especially important when the investigation is conducted weeks later,
after an MTBC identification or unusual drug-resistance pattern has been
determined. Using this information could prevent erroneous reporting or assist
a false-positive investigation.

**While it is advisable to monitor laboratory procedures and policies
proactively, laboratories may receive inquiries from a healthcare provider or
TB Program regarding test results. It may be necessary to initiate an
investigation based on these inquiries to provide as much information to the
healthcare provider or TB Program for appropriate patient care. Development of
a laboratory procedure to review specimen processing logs, patient history,
susceptibility patterns, and genotyping for suspected false-positive cases
should be implemented.

Monitoring for False-Positive Results Outside the Laboratory

Retrospective identification of false-positive MTBC results is accomplished
through active and passive surveillance by both TB Programs and healthcare
providers. This monitoring is critical in addition to laboratory monitoring.
Communication between TB Programs, healthcare providers, and laboratories must
remain open and is essential when results are questionable.

###### **A. TB Program**

Through monitoring or review of case results, the TB Program should alert the
testing laboratory and healthcare provider of any patient suspected of having
a false-positive result and an investigation should be initiated. Based on
evidence from the investigation, genotyping can be requested (if not already
reported) from the National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center to aid
in the determination of a false-positive result. If the investigation leads to
the conclusion that a false-positive result is likely, the TB Program should:

###### **B** **.** **Healthcare Provider**

A healthcare provider may suspect a false-positive laboratory result when a
patient has a positive TB test result but no signs/symptoms of TB, clinical
presentation that is inconsistent with TB, or radiographic findings that are
inconsistent with TB. In addition, a healthcare provider may suspect cross-
contamination if multiple specimens have been submitted for a patient and only
one is culture-positive, while all have negative AFB smears (11, 15). Other
patient indicators that may initiate a false-positive TB investigation
include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Patient has no risk factors for TB,

Initial Communication of a Potential False-Positive

A false-positive investigation can be initiated by a laboratory, TB Program,
healthcare provider, or submitter. Recall that false-positives may be caused
by a variety of reasons, including laboratory cross-contamination,
contamination of a clinical device or container during specimen collection,
and clerical error prior to specimen receipt in the laboratory. If the
laboratory determines that a false-positive result has potentially occurred,
the laboratory should notify the TB Program and healthcare provider in a
timely manner. When reviewing patient results and epidemiologic factors during
routine surveillance activities, TB Programs may notice results that are not
consistent with patient history. In this situation, the TB Program should
notify the laboratory and healthcare provider immediately.

When test results are questioned as potential false-positives, justification
should be provided when requesting or initiating an investigation. This
justification should include the reason for the investigation, patient
identifiers, laboratory/specimen accession numbers including date of receipt
in the laboratory, patient clinical presentation and history, and patient test
results from all laboratories where testing was performed.

After communication is established with all essential persons, an
investigation strategy should be developed for every false-positive inquiry.
Consideration should be given to laboratory procedures and policies, patient
clinical presentation and history, and specimen collection practices.
Collaboration among the laboratory, TB Program, healthcare providers, and
submitters in a potential false-positive investigation is essential.

Laboratory Areas for Investigation

![TB Cahart](/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/false_positive/images/chart-

When a false-positive test result is suspected, it is important to review all
information or data related to the laboratory testing of the specimen(s).
Investigations should include:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Review of specimen processing log for possible clerical error(s)  
**The laboratory specimen processing log is a record of information about when
specimens are initially processed and tested. Review the specimen processing
log for accuracy and notes of incidents that may have occurred during
processing. Pay attention to possible clerical errors related to the order of
the specimens processed or transcription errors. Also, determine if a large
number of specimens were processed in one batch. If another department is
responsible for accessioning patient specimens, it may be beneficial to
inquire about the process used to organize, label, and enter information or
data about patient specimens (34).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * **Review of laboratory specimen processing log to determine if known MTBC positive patients or highly AFB smear-positive specimens were processed in the same batch  
**Contamination from a positive to a negative specimen is more likely to occur
in specimen processing runs in which MTBC positive specimens are processed
alongside new patient specimens. Additionally, highly AFB smear-positive
specimens can also be the contamination source for a false-positive result due
to the high bacterial burden in the smear-positive specimen (35, 36).

**Genotyping analyzes the genetic material (e.g., DNA) of MTBC. The genotype
of a suspected false-positive isolate may match the genotype of the isolate
that was the suspected source of the contamination (36).  When possible,
another specimen from the patient(s) should be sent for genotyping.

**Matching genotype results of a new MTBC positive patient with a previous
MTBC positive patient or multiple MTBC positive patients with matching
genotypes may suggest that there was cross-contamination during specimen
processing (35, 36).

**When multiple patient specimens in a diagnostic series are submitted over
time with varying test results, this may suggest that a possible error in
testing has occurred. If the patient isolates have different genotypes, then
this is likely the result of contamination. However, this is not always the
case.

**If an isolate from a patient specimen has a genotype that matches a
laboratory PT or QC strain, this may identify the source of contamination that
caused the false-positive result. PT samples and positive QC strains to be
used as controls should not be processed with patient specimens. Procedures
should be reviewed if the same BSC or pipette was used to process PT specimens
during a previous batch or if the same bottles of reagents were used for both
PT or QC and patient specimen processing.

**Laboratory and clinical results should be consistent. Clinical symptoms of
TB disease are a good indicator of a true positive specimen result, while the
absence of clinical symptoms would suggest a false-positive result in most
cases (35, 37). On occasion, false-positive results can occur in a patient
with TB disease.

**It is important to ensure that a patient collection container is associated
with the correct patient specimen. Patient specimens collected on the same day
or in the same location increases the potential for specimen mix-up. This is
especially concerning if patient specimens previously identified as MTBC are
collected with other patient specimens on the same day or at the same time at
the same location. Contamination has been noted from the same location using
the same collection instruments such as bronchoscopes (38, 39).

**It is important to properly label patient collection containers. Clerical
errors can occur when specimens are being prepared for submission to the
laboratory. Patient information and specimen collection containers should be
checked for accuracy and to ensure the patient information matches.

**Laboratory-specific data should include a record of culture growth rates for
MTBC-positive specimens. False-positive specimens, resulting from carry-over
during specimen processing, will most likely have fewer organisms compared to
a known MTBC-positive specimen. Slower growth rate and lower colony counts
have been observed with false-positive specimens (35, 36).

**All laboratory standard operating procedures should be followed. Excessive
work schedules, reduced staffing, and large specimen processing batches, can
all contribute to errors and potential contamination of specimens. Regular
observation of technique and review of best practices should be implemented
for all staff (40). It may be beneficial during an investigation to speak with
staff who performed the testing to understand if anything unusual with the
specimen processing batch occurred.

**Nonconforming event reporting keeps track of irregular events that occur in
the laboratory (e.g., departure from a documented requirement or procedure
such as a regulation, statute, policy, procedure, customer requirement). These
events could contribute to either a false-positive result or ongoing
laboratory issues that need to be resolved.

Actions Taken as a Result of an Investigation

Throughout a false-positive investigation, communication among all partners is
vital. The laboratory should provide updates to the TB Program and healthcare
providers as new information becomes available. Similarly, the TB Program and
healthcare provider should keep the laboratory aware of any pertinent
information regarding patients including clinical presentation and
epidemiologic investigations. Forming a committee consisting of both
laboratory and the TB Program representatives is beneficial for awareness and
future collaboration. If the patient is hospitalized, it is also important
that the facility's infection prevention team is aware of the concern of a
false-positive result.

A suspected false-positive result should be considered "likely" if one or more
of the following criteria are met:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Genotyping shows a match with the presumed source of the false-positive result

Depending on the outcome of the false-positive investigation, it may be
appropriate to update or correct patient test results. While not a substitute
for clinical judgement, a thorough false-positive investigation is important
to ensure healthcare providers receive accurate patient test results to
consider when making patient treatment decisions. The ability to provide
corrected reports may depend on the functionality of the laboratory
information management system. The laboratory should communicate with the TB
Program and healthcare providers regarding progress of the investigation
including specific patient test results.

Within the laboratory and outside of the laboratory, the conclusion of a
false-positive investigation provides the opportunity for reeducation,
additional training, or reassessment of policies and procedures. Additionally,
this is an opportunity to ensure that laboratorians are performing best
practices through competency training.

Laboratories should consider the importance of developing a policy related to
false-positive investigations. This policy should include common steps, flags,
or scenarios that the laboratory can monitor to proactively assess whether a
false-positive investigation is necessary, as well as a communication plan for
involved partners. A false-positive investigation policy is necessary for
consistent and accurate communication among the laboratory, TB Program,
hospitals, and healthcare providers and for appropriate patient care.
