## Summary

X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging
creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your
body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues
absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the
most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look
gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black.

The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but
x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot
pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.

When you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of
your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For
example, a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of
radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.
