## Summary

The brain is the control center of the body. It controls thoughts, memory,
speech, and movement. It regulates the function of many organs. When the brain
is healthy, it works quickly and automatically. However, when problems occur,
the results can be devastating.

Inflammation in the brain can lead to problems such as vision loss, weakness
and paralysis. Loss of brain cells, which happens if you suffer a stroke, can
affect your ability to think clearly. Brain tumors can also press on nerves
and affect brain function. Some brain diseases are genetic. And we do not know
what causes some brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

The symptoms of brain diseases vary widely depending on the specific problem.
In some cases, damage is permanent. In other cases, treatments such as
surgery, medicines, or physical therapy can correct the source of the problem
or improve symptoms.
