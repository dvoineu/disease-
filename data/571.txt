## Summary

Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes
that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls
of your airways become sore and swollen.

In the United States, about 20 million people have asthma. Nearly 9 million of
them are children. Children have smaller airways than adults, which makes
asthma especially serious for them. Children with asthma may experience
wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and trouble breathing, especially early
in the morning or at night.

Many things can cause asthma, including

    * Allergens - mold, pollen, animals
    * Irritants - cigarette smoke, air pollution
    * Weather - cold air, changes in weather
    * Exercise 
    * Infections - flu, common cold

When asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack.
Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop
asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.
