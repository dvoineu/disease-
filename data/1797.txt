## Summary

Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth. It consists of two main
parts. The upper part is the maxilla. It doesn't move. The moveable lower part
is called the mandible. You move it when you talk or chew. The two halves of
the mandible meet at your chin. The joint where the mandible meets your skull
is the temporomandibular joint.

Jaw problems include

    * Fractures (broken bones)
    * Dislocations
    * Temporomandibular joint dysfunction
    * Osteonecrosis, which happens when your bones lose their blood supply
    * Cancers

Treatment of jaw problems depends on the cause.
