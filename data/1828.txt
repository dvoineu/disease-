**Hepatitis D** , also known as "delta hepatitis," is a liver infection caused
by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Hepatitis D is uncommon in the United States.
Hepatitis D only occurs in people who are infected with the hepatitis B virus
because HDV is an incomplete virus that requires the helper function of HBV to
replicate. HDV can be an acute, short-term, infection or a long-term, chronic
infection. Hepatitis D is transmitted through percutaneous or mucosal contact
with infectious blood and can be acquired either as a coinfection with HBV or
as superinfection in people with HBV infection. There is no vaccine for
hepatitis D, but it can be prevented in people who are not already HBV-
infected by hepatitis B vaccination.
