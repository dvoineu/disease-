## Summary

Noroviruses are a group of related viruses. Infection with these viruses
causes an illness called gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and
intestines. It can spread from person to person, or through contaminated food
or water. You can also get it if you touch a contaminated surface. Norovirus
can be serious, especially for young children and older adults.

The most common symptoms of norovirus infection are

    * Diarrhea
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Stomach pain

Other symptoms may include fever, headache or body aches.

Treatment includes bed rest and lots of liquids to prevent dehydration. There
is no specific medicine to treat norovirus infections.

Proper hand washing and safe food preparation may help prevent infections.
