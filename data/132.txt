## Summary

Many men have sexual problems. They become more common as men age. Problems
can include

  * Erectile dysfunction
  * Reduced or lost interest in sex
  * Problems with ejaculation
  * Low testosterone

Stress, illness, medicines, or emotional problems may also be factors.
Occasional problems with sexual function are common. If problems last more
