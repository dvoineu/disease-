## Summary

Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. If you don't
get enough nutrients -- including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and
minerals \- you may suffer from malnutrition.

Causes of malnutrition include:

    * Lack of specific nutrients in your diet. Even the lack of one vitamin can lead to malnutrition.
    * An unbalanced diet
    * Certain medical problems, such as malabsorption syndromes and cancers

Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss. Or, you may have no
symptoms. To diagnose the cause of the problem, your doctor may do blood tests
and a nutritional assessment. Treatment may include replacing the missing
nutrients and treating the underlying cause.
