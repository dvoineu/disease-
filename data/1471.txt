**La Crosse encephalitis** is a viral disease spread to people by the bite of
an infected mosquito. Most cases occur in the upper Midwestern, mid-Atlantic,
and southeastern states. Many people infected have no apparent symptoms. Some
of those who become ill develop severe neuroinvasive disease (disease that
affects the nervous system). Severe disease often involves encephalitis (an
inflammation of the brain) and can include seizures, coma, and paralysis.
Severe disease occurs most often in children under the age of 16.
