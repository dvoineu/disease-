## Summary

If you have ever had athlete's foot or a yeast infection, you can blame a
fungus. A fungus is a primitive organism. Mushrooms, mold and mildew are
examples. Fungi live in air, in soil, on plants and in water. Some live in the
human body. Only about half of all types of fungi are harmful.

Some fungi reproduce through tiny spores in the air. You can inhale the spores
or they can land on you. As a result, fungal infections often start in the
lungs or on the skin. You are more likely to get a fungal infection if you
have a weakened immune system or take antibiotics.

Fungi can be difficult to kill. For skin and nail infections, you can apply
medicine directly to the infected area. Oral antifungal medicines are also
available for serious infections.
